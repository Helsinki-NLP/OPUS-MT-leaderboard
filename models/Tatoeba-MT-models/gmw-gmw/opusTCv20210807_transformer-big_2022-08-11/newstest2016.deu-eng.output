Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama-proclaimed deal on Iran’s nuclear program has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, which was partly considered an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, he had rejected a meeting with reference to the election in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a slightly trembling voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
There was no evidence that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after.
Until the end of the day there was another death: lamb took his life when the police bound him.
A day after the shooting at the university, forcing students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his classes.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some propensities for problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm had told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons, saying he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic path to becoming an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn’t know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “of course there was something in Mr. Lamb’s imagination.”
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from the campus, police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent's home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his PhD in Education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the swarm of women at the time.
All the girls melted when he was there,” said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no deed of marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss’ ex-husband, Shawn O’Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night for the last time on the night of September 5 after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica play in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, headed the first semester seminary program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight commemoration on Tuesday evening.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students to return,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that while Lam in his emergency call referred to Prentiss as his wife, there is no indication that the two ever married.
Toys R Us Plans to Hire Less Workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give the employees and seasonal workers currently employed at it a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, while 45,000 more were hired during the 2014 Christmas season.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start interviewing this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I realize the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me,” he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, Back in Time.
The film begins, and it comes to mind that I am a simulated yawning and an arm’s length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
“It’s really for me,” Spielberg said, “indisputably the biggest time travel movie ever shot.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the US, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - on the margins of the General Assembly ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers “make this situation insoluble.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria that they have demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll scores that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn’t worked (yet).
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump lead in the double-digit area, and some are starting to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at that time in 2011 Rick Perry’s leadership was handed over to the ascending Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump’s stamina and starting to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey scores that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of ten Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers remain in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “annoyed” if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they’re “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent saying the same thing about Trump).
Next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio at only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “disgruntled” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish Republicans tend to believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper for a president, ABC News/Washington Post said on Monday.
The same number applies to the nation’s first primary state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively perform his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That’s a change since four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination versus only 28% for final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey from Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their minds.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Trump say they have firmly forgiven their votes.
Of course, a lot can be done to change that, and no one can really say never change their minds.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outcast, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve formed their minds are twice as likely to be for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a focal point in the public discourse over 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expressions will keep decisive Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after Monday’s new ABC/post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do so.
Frustration over the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post’s new Monday poll, they’d rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
They are also angry with Washington.
A poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “hellishly upset.”
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a canopy house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"The range of objects on Sylt is naturally limited," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student hostel in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany’s top residential locations, however, the price seems like peanuts.
Real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices at dizzying heights.
There are tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, remember.
But well, who can afford it...
Incidentally, Munich is not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to win a earned 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the witch-boiler of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52/90.+2) and Götz's goal (89.) earned with 3-0 (0-0).
The twelfth success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
In his 28th goal in the Champions League to the Bavarian leadership, Müller received friendly assistance from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who let one shot of the world champion, thought to be a flank, pass.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game at Karaiskakis Stadium before 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich people kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed notion without shining.
Piraeus had won his latest six home matches in the premier class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled (1:3).
But Bayern, unconquered in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went boldly, but often too imaginative in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were initiated too often by a game shift on the left outside Douglas Costa, who rarely came through against the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right than his flank from the right half field in the upper left toreck.
In the 67th minute, the World Champion gave the possible 2-0.
The best opportunities in half one were for Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown knocked Poland’s headball off the line (26th).
Then by direct pickup, the goalkeeper Roberto pared with his knee (35th).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needle stitches.
But the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer relied on.
When he fired a shot from Ideye over the latte (56.).
Guardiola had a chain of four defended with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the squad, sat outside at first.
The World Cup hero did not give the green light until after the final training, said sports board member Matthias Sammer at Sky: "Whoever wants to make something else out of it, that is already vicious".
Guardiola also decided against him on the first change when he brought Kingsley Coman for the battered Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by penalty Müller put another one on it.
Before the game, there were riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly disguised Bavarian fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of Host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported injured from the stadium.
Anyone who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth.
Those who smoke do not only harm the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a long-term study from Potsdam.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is according to the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In comparison to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely was 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and tooth loss therefore stems from more frequent gum infections in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to drop back to the level of non-smokers, said lead author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
One must convince people to become non-smokers, said study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the life span."
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, leads to good dental health until old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous research suggests that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists find remains from late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic-Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called soil monuments.
For all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialist office for archaeological soil conservation.
In the third construction phase of the Rhine Boulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
It was already known from text documents that there was a fortress in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman has died at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police ask the population for help.
In the early morning of Wednesday around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks from the direction of the station building at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train that came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By capturing the train, she carried the most serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was treated on site by emergency services and taken to a hospital.
The investigating officials have no information on the reason for the young woman’s nightly crossing of the track.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information about the cause of the accident can be given at the 24-hour and free hotline of the Federal Police on the phone 0800/6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which corresponds significantly to more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the presentation.
The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government has announced support.
TTIP is the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration process specifically stipulate that the EU and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They should come equally from the EU, the US and third countries.
For the first time, there is also a second instance.
It would allow appeals to be made against judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of appeal against their judgments.
In the discussion of recent months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she wants to work towards an international investment court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be resolved.
The investor-state arbitration proceedings (ISDS) demanded mainly by large corporations are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitral tribunals are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice through which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, lift national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial statements, anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact described the EU Commission’s proposals as inadequate.
It was criticized above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German economic secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission takes into account in the reform essential points that Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the legal opportunities of the economy with too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could be concluded, remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be in place by the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delikater Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost moved by Steven’s talk.
He talks about his minuscule and delicately arranged songs by means of various places, which he draws on the map again and again.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative madman.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", released in 2003, cleverly composed songs appear that blend harmoniously with American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into great opulent drifts at any time.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" is the first part of a bold series: each of the 50 US states should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positive certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live is enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
"Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise" is a highly acclaimed masterpiece from 2005.
Plenty of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any of the annual best lists of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses very extensive electronic offset pieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
Long since the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the darkened hamburger More!
He mainly presents the theatre’s “Carrie & Lowell”, which has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, Stevens, who has become much more mature, returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word addressed to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the broadly enriched album.
From the audience you hear: the lecture is "opulent" and you can basically throw away the "plate".
Only to an encore does Stevens modestly thank him, plays fewer older songs acoustically and finally bows under a roaring applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut is eagerly awaited at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to make his debut at the Prime Minister’s Question Time and to engage with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will stand up to ask the first of his six predefined questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be scrutinized up close by the media and the Labour MPs.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr. Corbyn’s leadership, as she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain silent on Tuesday while singing the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he had “standed in respectful silence” and acknowledged the “heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle of England.”
But a member of Mr. Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem “independent” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in business, defense, and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also “stacking” within Labour, following Mr. Corbyn’s comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is submitting amendments to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said the party was “very clear” that it was only against the government’s plans to reduce the limit from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to face David Cameron, since he was Tory’s boss, over the last decade across the dispatch box in parliament.
The Labour chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has “crowd-sourced” ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister’s Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both “beating skill” and fighting with reluctance, and instead has set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, when Mr Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also brought up the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor and that he had addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "casperle theater," often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the questionnaire with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it had become a cartoon and needed far-reaching reforms.
‘Shooted in Joburg’: Homeless young people trained to be photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street kids have found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and get a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound increases due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose bounced after data indicating an increase in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
Since 2009, this percentage has been the fastest and best estimate of the timing of an interest rate increase.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to €1,3730 to 0.84% against the euro.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a 20% jump after taking offer of rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the Richemont luxury competition group.
Richemont’s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are reporting growth again.
Glencore’s shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decline of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs set its rating to “sell”.
JD Sports increased 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The CEO of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappies 21 years young, a hen flange with superb frieze.
The guy with the platinum-blond hair is 100 million euros.
Preferably more.
Currently Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
Generation U17 is running.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone slabs of Berlin’s luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here lives her idol, whose posters have been hanging in Stettin since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs just as much a day as her mom Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Wiktoria would have to be in the 10th grade in high school."
“I’m fulfilling a dream for her.”
Compulsory schooling?
Who's itching?
Not the fans.
Not even Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertisement in the Superbowl’s advertising break, he collected three million dollars, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company washed many, many dollars into Bieber’s account.
And with every doll that looks like him and walks over the counter, Bieber also cashes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you are amazed at the window pane.
He is said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Bieber is in the U.S. and the U.K. with his new single “What do you mean?”
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least he does.
Pegida Poster Brings Lebanese to Kartoffeldöner Idea
Potatoes or dunes?
Both are possible - in the Kartoffeldöner, developed by the Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
The idea came from a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of dunes", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a grill skewer with meat and potatoes has been spinning in his shop.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The Lebanese has now registered with the patent office in Munich.
There, according to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
How much meat and potatoes the spear contains, Alhay does not want to reveal.
Only so much: “It tastes even better together,” he finds.
Culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground-based campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-based campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as through events like Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Dunsborough ice cream manufacturer Simmo distributing samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets to the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29th, when the food, alcohol and equipment wholesaler conducts its annual investor strategy day.
There’s a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will snatch about five percent of the food market in these two states and take away sales from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating revenues of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery store and in quantities on Metcash’s high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food sales will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash was likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass’ comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reduction while simultaneously pushing sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is resisting and investing more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through fast-growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash’s chief executive, Ian Morrice, says price adjustments and store remediation programs are going to grow, and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis Supports Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the “collateral damages” in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and, in the opinion of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", fell into the spotlight by Kyrgios's infamous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a spasm thwarted a potential U.S. open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"One thing I'm pretty mature about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been a little drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost to the U.S. Open because of a cramp, but he’s not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He’s got a great team around him, he’s got a great family around him, and I think he’s been treated a little too strict.
He’s a very mature 19-year-old, he’s working very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he’s never had a problem with the other players, he’s respected in the changing area, he’s training hard, he’s good in shape, he’s a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that starts Friday, and he describes the “common decision” as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term permanent component.”
“First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick made the ascent very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time out of the limelight, where he can only think about it, I think it's the best, and it's the best team
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, holding all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no man’s country and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted “Open the border!” and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some rejected food and water in protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” for migrants to be sent back from Hungary as more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks will have to take place with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc was unable to agree on a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the surprised Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that eventually – next month or by the end of the year – an agreement would be reached that EU countries would accept another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not hope for an immediate action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country – after finishing a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most incomings are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection – a view that strongly contradicts other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also lay down higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
“Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the military deployment expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, state security adviser to Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people’s data and pressed a crowd to squeeze themselves into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would deny food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground over her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent earlier), while Sanders ranks second, with 27 percent (a 17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, receives support from 15 percent of the Democratic voters of the primaries.
More than five months before the primaries start, most democratic voters say it’s too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their elections than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some profits.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but those leads have diminished.
Their support for the men has decreased significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton’s advantage over democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead on the liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead on this group.
Approximately half of the Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she was nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
6% would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently don’t support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republican voters say so about their top candidate Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the belief that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Approval for dealing with the problems and the electability are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for president, 57 percent of the Democratic voters of the primaries want to see him in the race – although one-third believe he shouldn’t.
When Democratic voters of the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democrat nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, that figure has fallen by 78 percent in the past month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that considers him the "most selectable" has risen.
Nevertheless, when asked what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters raise questions about electoral capacity.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these primary voters stands out as unacceptable.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, deliver good results on some key features of voters in their party’s primary elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.
Biden scores best in the three candidates on honesty, while Clinton’s strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as ideologically consistent with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue to be asked about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters of the primaries are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it has not influenced her opinions overall.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinions of her had worsened.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party voters, this remains a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, 8% less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62% of voters don’t think they’re an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of voters nationwide view Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush score best on honesty.
A majority considers Sanders to be honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson gets close behind Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump at latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new poll, and others are dramatically losing hold.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide. Support is growing from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month to 27% in Tuesday’s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is well received by demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who fell the lowest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows that Carson is rising in polls – he ends up at 19% support from Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some sidelines for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peaks are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathers to find still warm water.
A bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some do not go into the sea anymore: The water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
The Mediterranean Sea, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east it even reaches 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch college novice
Almost two years after a student died during a harassment ritual of a student union in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand with his eyes closed and repeatedly attacked as he tried to approach a target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s national president, to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically put the good of the brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted blunt force injuries on the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood, at least one student has died from the harassment every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassment and the formation of a criminal organization.
“We don’t just want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this – officially or unofficially – we will hold them accountable,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the boom will be shaken, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slip into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That’s why U.S. Central Bank representatives have stressed so strongly that investors should focus not on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather on the time period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated because of an interest rate increase.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of 'cheap money'," Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal highs, but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here’s a look at how some sectors of the economy might react based on historical trends:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for wealth gains to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy,” German bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed’s interest rate increases.
More specifically, the market is mostly on the uptrend over the past 35 years – about 14 percent – on the way to raising interest rates, pretty flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return on investment in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the raising cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often promote it.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
What is extremely remarkable here is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, with the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, nominal GDP was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate increases with such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question, “whether it’s different this time,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a Fed rate hike throughout the year, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week ending Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all cycles of increase from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP, and have shadowed pre-recession heights very quickly after recovery has begun," the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase, and the pattern is pretty much similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
For bonds, returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to contract closer and lead to flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds often yield better yields in such a climate, although “we’re still careful to expect higher yields,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded, and volatility has increased – all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
On the whole, companies that do the greater part of their business in the U.S. will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debts.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Companies with strong balance sheets have surpassed companies with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for its "distortion"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits.
MEP Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms" to Classic FM, claiming to be a leading member of parliament and increasing new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public radio station was “stupid” and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'dummy' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be only under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something else – these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you’re actually just imitating what’s already on the market,” Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director General rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I won't learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there’s a commitment to live music and music that’s really unbeatable.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, finding new music and commissioning new works, I think is really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that there is a need to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sports for kicking the commercial rival on the feet.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show – with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges – was produced “in a special BBC way.”
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit from our in-house stable" the next time it started an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday slowed spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating, after new figures showed only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest growth since the beginning of records in 2000, with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, that has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now that’s coming in, and we may see growth diminishing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers will withhold their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers crowded around their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant sites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, on which buyers fought for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of 5 issues, a little more than 1 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried in Mecca in crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partially blames the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane fell
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane at Mecca’s Grand Mosque collapsed.
Mourners, largely dressed in white, filled the track to pay their respects as the first of the dead embarked on their last journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed by the Holy Place, where just days earlier a building crane plunged through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the worshippers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beetles killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj at the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly promised that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands continuing to come to the city.
Today King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-owned Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not report this detail, but said that the company’s management of foreign travel is prohibited.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane that plunged into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the Krans collapse, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s Great Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking on major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials be paid to the families of the killed and the same amount of permanent injuries.
Other injured people receive half of that amount.
B&Q Boss Says The Time Of Cheap Eastern European Craftsmen Is Over
British employ increasingly craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that British lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home.
If you can skillfully handle a hammer or brush to paint walls, you seem to be in a minority these days.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to do home improvement jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, Kingfisher’s new managing director, who owns the hardware chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now out of date.
Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men are more important than the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, “It’s still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed on the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial director.
Mrs Laury said: “This was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year earnings and revenues after the group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Aich/Dob officials in court for infidelity
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-champion Aich/Dob were charged with infidelity and tax evasion at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse.
He was acquitted of this charge in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Prosecutor Robert Riffel, it had emerged in the preliminary investigation that the defendants used funds from association accounts through which they were allowed to dispose in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial crimes.
This fact was dismissed by the Chairman of the Schöffensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
To the rejection of the infidelity, the defense presented that the association had not at any time incurred a property disadvantage.
The sports officials only charged expenses and led the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to about 600,000 shillings (roughly 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: Do we continue to run the club or are we locking it up?" one of the defendants, in the bread profession, told the tax office's large-scale auditor.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
“We’ve advanced money, put our life insurance as collateral at the bank,” he said at the hearing.
With the association has been agreed: you can freely manage the money, only no debts can be made.
Furthermore, in the event of a corresponding financial success, the payment of the expense compensation was decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, some of the expenses were only paid out years later, namely from 2003, when there was a plus on the account.
Therefore, flat-rate debits and not detailed debits appeared, the former obmann explained the processes.
The accounts and savings accounts managed the two defendants together, the second accused said.
Why the payments were not disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the financial event in detail, but only the freedom of debt was important, according to the answer.
When an official began an investigation against him for misuse of office in 2011, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association’s account.
These were backpacks, the defendants said.
This security account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association.
“Why?” the judge wanted to know.
The respondent knew no answer for a long time.
Finally, he said he thought it was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The defendant was informed, the official justified himself.
This remittance was formulated as “damage compensation”.
Why damage compensation?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With that, you're all out of line."
“Am I a lawyer?” he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never received a penny salary, he only charged mileage and diets.
He charged the club 1,000 euros per month on diets, but the actual expense was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide precise documents for the early years.
These were no longer stored after an inspection in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant was also charged with mileage.
All corrections were made in cash, he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The trial will continue on September 23 with the interrogation of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three-year workforce cut, the computer giant will cut further jobs in the company’s split.
The job cuts at the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This will save $2.7 billion (2.4 billion euros), the company said on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The 55,000-job cut that has been going on for three years has not yet been completed.
HP still had around 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
Hewlett-Packard’s shares declined by 2.3 percent.
The company, which has grown up with printers from Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up: The computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data stores for companies and other services.
Both businesses will be listed on the stock exchange.
Another disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services have lastly boosted the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
This decreased revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only reacted lately to customers increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans envisage a total of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely rejected: 54 percent opposed it, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24% are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A collaboration with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad rejected 51 percent of respondents, 20 percent would be in favour.
29% were unable to decide.
Car: Second Press Day at the 66th IAA
The exhibition will focus on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two days in the press, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition on Thursday.
The general public can attend the IAA from Saturday onwards.
As two years ago, the organizers of the car association VDA expect about 900 000 visitors.
Röszke: Violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water cannons on the Serbian border at Röszke against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
Behind it had formed a police line and behind the police officers was a water cannon ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials used pepper spray continuously at first.
The police then used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn a bit.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
The Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world watches when the Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision as to whether or not interest rates will be raised for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who believed last week that the Fed was going to do so now think the Fed is going to stay a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL.
"For the first time, we're approaching a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior associate at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
Death Shooter at Delta State University Leaves Apology Letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – and before shooting and killing his colleague later in the day – Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was “pitying” for the first murder and wanted “he could undo it,” authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 on Monday morning.
He said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency department staff that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, “I shot my wife last night” and he also mentioned that there was a “sweet dog” in the house but that “will not bother anyone,” but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, “I’m so sorry, I wanted to be able to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn’t know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “of course there was something in Mr. Lamb’s imagination.”
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was “no information, no evidence” for a “triangular relationship.”
Prentiss was described by Shawn O’Steen, who said they were married for about seven years, as a “good person.”
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "destroyed."
He said Prentiss was their daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives on Monday at a certain time to tell them, “He’s not going to jail.”
When police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a PhD from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his life-style indicates on the university’s website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charms
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also allegedly struggles with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this will surely take its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major consolidation.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
150 of the world’s approximately 1,000 executives will be costing the company’s job.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation is a earnings contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, there will no longer be a board of directors for the passenger business at Lufthansa in the future.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings on the board team led by Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the new line-up, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-employee company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with pilots
In the collective bargaining conflict with the pilots’ association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed this Thursday after the court-stopped strike.
The union shared that.
The topic of the talks will be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve viable results as quickly as possible "in a year with a predicted record result".
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
The background is in addition to the transitional supply of the pilots the savings concept "wings".
It stipulates that Lufthansa will outsource routes to the Group’s own low-cost line Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this will make the left defender cry and exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be relocated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It’s horrible – a boy who comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read, "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery starts now, I'm coming back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: “It’s a very serious injury.”
When a player leaves the court with this type of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
“He’s doing very hard because it wasn’t his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear it’s a very serious injury, that’s not good,” Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it feels like, I know how hard such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul of Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better.
It’s one thing that all parents will soon learn: if your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the prime minister opted for The Lorax, Dr. Seuss' 1971 environmental fable.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company’s website, and continues, “funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book I like to read to my children because it always seems to give a picture or message that we’ve missed so far.”
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a content quote from the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads.
As if that weren’t suspicious enough: Cameron’s text reads in part like the summary of the Lorax movie presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins: “In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey’s heart, the girl of his dreams.”
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book, where an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is ravaged by the greedy, tree-falling, thneed-knitting once-man, despite the protests of the nicknamed lorax, a squatting, snorky creature "speaking in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron’s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron’s staff, but did not provide any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
"To meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the squad that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out a win away.
Alastair Cook’s site may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they will not carry scars of 2012, just a teen-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth retires from the England test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth, of course, is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are geared towards results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination as - and I said this earlier - players are their own best pickers.
A long time ago, Lyth would have been extended, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he hopes to hit out more runs for Yorkshire, there is another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his stance, even if he didn’t do so well, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test bat is given to set its mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances – like Sam Robson before him – while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play at home and away.
The only accusation you can make was that England first started Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top shape - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a percussionist I highly esteem.
He’s an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us in a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
He must get at least the same chances as before, but of course this depends on the team lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat Cook, which would yield an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, emerged, and I have nothing against it.
I don’t see why a batman can’t beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he’s a devil’s guy of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a No. 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his stats -- on average 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball -- and think it's a point, but there's not a large number of backup spiders raising their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England has made a few smart additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the tour’s white ball phase and brings energy and a powerful insert into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with what was previously said.
Colly’s team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, isn’t used for the One-Days, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that for my part.
While some won’t agree, coaches and team line-ups don’t set the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with an easy heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit of the UK from the EU) could gain influx if the economy gets into a whirlwind by 2017
David Cameron’s unfinished renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is going to get deeper into trouble every day, even without the election of the ingenious Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn as leader of Labour or the TUC, who violently clashes over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always on their own account, are fed up with Britain’s self-created agenda of split concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that they also do not like it if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking UK inside the EU tent – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin – and lets see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don’t care if we stay or go.
Germany’s cautiously thought-out chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the exaggeratedly long-standing ones like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Francois Hollande looks forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to imagine they’re going to tear out a leg to help the selfie Brits whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK – something they don’t want either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, while Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense, and what EU skeptics are the press baron’s oligarchy, as they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 at a ratio of 2:1.
You may remember poorly Boris Johnson, the arch-euro opportunist who made a name for himself as a “EU straight banana” Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing villains, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but noted that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s swirling referendum, for Blair had put the principle above the EU’s unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus opening a backdoor to him.
The press has never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he doesn't need to waste any more time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's 80s boycott Murdoch strategy, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I kindly put it - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's traditional blue dye tendency and the wilder areas of Tory's small-englishism can say yes to it.
It’s what Hilary “A Benn But Not a Bennite” Benn said on radio and television this week when the scout was struggling in him not to admit that Corbyn’s appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow fighters and deputies, according to all the reports at their clue session on Monday night.
Whatever Corbyn’s rousing bottom-up image wants to convey – remember that he even touched me – news discipline remains important around the clock in the age of TV and above all in the whirlpool of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s right not to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe that allows him to take Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental ambiguities about EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities on NATO – Tom Watson is rock-solidly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave – foreign diplomats will be required to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the launch on Monday of what was called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts Criticize Public Health England Report on E-Cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, in part with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released the “Principle Report” last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of evidence.”
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the “extraordinarily windy foundation” on which PHE established its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims “build on stone or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A basic public health principle is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to lead their opinions on the harms of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was previously reported to have received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said they were receiving funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding they were reported to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not delivered, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
PHE’s tobacco management also participated in the meeting.
The group's research "significantly admits" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products on most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers” were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ had been responded to earlier.
He said, “E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.”
One in two life-long smokers dies of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year.
By providing clear evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
Former Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would “give their right arm” for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard-fought time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been unsuccessfully trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4.
“I have problems with the idea that BBC commissions or broadcasts programs that would also be clearly shown by non-subsidized rivals,” Johnson told the Oberhaus Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the BBC’s future.
If you want to keep the broadcast fee, which I don’t think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programs that others don’t do or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is of course nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t see why a regressive tax fund programs that could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don’t think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for ratings “because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support.”
His comments on the BBC’s most popular shows reflect what former Sky director Tony Ball suggested in his MacTaggart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs “should go to BBC4, where you can’t pretty much measure the audience, but they do their jobs, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify $4 billion in broadcast fees, “Well, of course, we’ve created all those obscure programs that no one’s seen.”
You put them in a window of time where no one ever wanted to see them.
Speaking about the broadcast fee, Johnson told the committee, “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of terms of who can get the best value from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think you get a lot of value here for 150 pounds a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission to “inform, educate and entertain.”
He said little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education – he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio – and she should take an example on public television channels in Australia and Canada to change this into “informing, enlightening and entertaining.”
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Proms, which he said only a handful will be shown on television, and enter into alliances with the commercial channels to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' Can Control Brain Cells Through Sound Waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that emits electrical impulses into people’s brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a Nature Communications report.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons.
The method has some similarities to Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that has to be sent down at an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Ads Shame on Britain's Arms Trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Waffen trade show video.
Awful killer drones!
Ankle shattering leg cuffs!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause agonizing pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon pictures leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms fair is a militant parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to swirl weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains that require a second look.
"Important Announcement: Are you going on DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads in the London Underground fonts and the DLR line's trademarks, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with the DLR...Customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are from artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy’s Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute it in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-pound pack of Inbus keys, which is claimed to "get access to about one-third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this plaque "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and find that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trading posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works charitably with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was astonished at the silence surrounding advertising for the Arms Fair – through an ExCeL calendar blanket – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertising, but "by blushing with bright colors and animation it remains more sticky."
“They did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” Amnesty’s Tom Davies said in a statement.
What we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the Arms Fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors excite fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals a U.S. Army order on "the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effect effects inside the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student residence, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I’ve annoyed – and the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The move into student residences ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely frightening.
It’s tempting to talk: tell people where you come from, if and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you “honestly say Marmite neither love nor hate, because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like unlike those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those were fire extinguishers.
Let people.
People’s rooms often turn into drink receptions, movie night venues, and community meeting places, but they’re also the places where people dress and put on their underwear.
Don’t forget to start a relationship at the university.
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a room-to-room stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I used to interact with you.”
Try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from socializing - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my student residences had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship by baking.
As you start college at the height of back-mania, knocking on people’s doors to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than welcoming the 1950s “Welcome to the neighborhood, I’ve baked something for you. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions.”
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to chat and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to stand asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, clawing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
Chances are they say they serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to handle it more balanced than my roommate who added a rinse to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn’t make any noise that keeps people from sleeping or from work.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that you are, in the truest sense of the proverb, one of the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they would mind putting drum & bass a little quieter, because it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 o’clock, she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two more hours before she let her own music squeez, closed her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student residence?
Conversely, would it not be abysmal embarrassing for you to think of a roommate as your future spouse, get to grips with her, break up, and then see her every day, and perhaps see her pull over all her friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own way – but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to convince your abdomen a little reason.
At the exciting moment when you notice someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between an owl and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments for it to become a boomerang.
By hiding, teach a valuable and amusing lesson about safety – but never mess up someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock her door, and place her keys in a glass of water, which you then place in the freezer - but tack her belongings on the ceiling no more than twice.
Townhouses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds rowhouses in the Corner Valley in central France for people who don’t have much money.
So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-earning."
“I’ll show you how you can still build cheaply and well today,” the 44-year-old says in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will press into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly more affordable housing can be created: he builds rowhouses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will press into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gymnasiums has no sustainability.
Because people stay here for a large part.
In view of the flow of refugees, we will also need enough housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when people are housed in blocks of housing.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it’s peace again, I’m going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros, excluding land.
That's manageable.
It took six months to build.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I have done my project correctly.
It is always particularly complicated by the impending Damocles sword special construction and the parking regulation.
Scary.
It is still assumed that who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities is there room for this.
Refugees and asylum seekers don’t have cars.
How did the residents react to their project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely wrong.
But do you not exacerbate the competition for affordable homes?
Gildner: True, we have had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but we have built luxury apartments that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earner.
I'll show you how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System When Apple Update Is Released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation because they receive an error message that states that "software update failed".
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait for the onslaught to go back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will take you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space – but Apple has made that less likely by streamlining the update, and it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could lead to an abort of the update.

Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The World Cup second, prior to the start of the decisive seven overseas races, emphasized "that I have nothing left to lose."
53 points separate the vice-world champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and double champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the twelve races of the season so far and also takes on the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will have an impact on the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
A haze bell has been hanging over the city for days, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the membership to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has been to the spa more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to accept chess players who are unable to pay the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" is seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town.
Quartiersbüro is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Old Centre Antonistift have joined forces under the cloak of the Social Foundation and opened a new point of contact at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and seekers receive information on issues such as nursing insurance or benefits from health and care funds.
For years we have noticed with our outpatient care service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are endless questions.
"Not infrequently, many services of the cash registers are not used, because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood," explained the new hostess Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the citizen hospital as well as the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The saludis were taken on board.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers of the Senior Center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The senior center for care and care," Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis, described.
The reason for the opening of the new quarterly office in the city centre is seen by both managing directors, particularly in the demographic change.
This makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, according to Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) at the inauguration ceremony, the district office also dedicates itself to the association in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gathering".
Thus, the social foundation makes a big contribution that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The Quarter Office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9am to 2pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4pm to 6pm and Saturday from 10am to 12pm.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third league Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th October was now set as a date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian football totopocal against the third league FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
The game will be played on Tuesday 6 October at 7 p.m. in the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
“We are happy to know now when the game is going on, now we have planning security,” says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points out the pre-sale of tickets that has been launched.
It’s something special for our team to play against a third-party league player.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 through victories with district league 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against regional league 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the 2016/2017 DFB Club Cup.
Title defender is third-liga player SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang dies at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Shaping.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasury in the Hofburg in Vienna and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Tim Wiese gets a police officer with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese was not well noticed in Bremen.
Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and involved with Bremen and Hoffenheim, is now a wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he did not give up.
Wiese had just cut his hair in downtown Bremen when he saw a car park guard displaying a fine for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of business, insulted the official and threw the fine to her feet, as the “Bild” newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under review," the city of Bremen said.
Only then will it be decided whether or not to display the meadow.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and rainforest-typical climate of Isla del Rey are ideal for the flourishing of marijuana plants.
For three days, Panamanian authorities have torn out the 4,500 plants and burned them.
Men beat 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 23:45, three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and told them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft gas station.
There were also three people in the gas station.
One of these men now shouted at the young man and slapped him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and bleed heavily from his nose.
When his two friends rushed in and calmed down on the thug, he initially abandoned his victim.
The injured young man was brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator chased the group with a car up to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man walked outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male person.
With the help of a baton, they beat the victim’s face and thighs.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racket was said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown-white shirt.

Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
This is something that mayor Bernd Bormann, Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf’s mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about.
Doctors are missing in many places in the country - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still halfway with his successor in the next few months.
After a phase of reconstruction, Müller will reopen the practice on 12 October, until then he will invest 310000 euros in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verdener Hospital and also wants to get into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
“When it was time, I just called her.”
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees the advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior emergency physician in the Diepholz district and is volunteering in the DRC-preparation Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as general practitioners.
“The endoscopy is coming out,” says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a consultation room more.
In addition, the EDP will be completely renewed.
The millers receive a total grant of 50,000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district (25,000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
“This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will be continued,” emphasizes Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come into Felstehausen every quarter, while the average in northern Germany is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another family practice.
A positive side effect of the practice acquisition by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If she hadn’t found a successor, she would have gone.
By the way, anyone who attends Müller’s consultation will continue to look mainly into familiar faces: takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning staff from Felstehausen.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers smiling.
She feels a little sadness after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients many times," says the intern.
Her husband adds laughingly, “We have a 6,000-square-metre plot.”
“I’ve always pushed myself to gardening, now it could be different.”
The couple also has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: 'We let the refugees through'
"Now the border controls are also being increased at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The checks on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It remains clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also do so "naturally".
The care and safety of the people is paramount.
But it is also clear that “it needs clear signals,” the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austro-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers 'corridor' - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow arriving refugees to travel to Austria and Germany, and that it might also build corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not the case with Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors is “absolutely unacceptable” and Slovenia will intensify the border surveillance, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister emphasized, Slovenian does not want to block its borders for refugees.
“Every EU member has to fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system will not work,” Györkös Znidar said.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to enter East Croatia at the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid in the night hours on Tuesday in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles are constantly arriving with new refugees in Tovarnik, Croatia.
It mainly concerns Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use.
In the coming days, his country expects about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported unanimously on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: “We cannot, nor do we want to do this,” it said.
According to media reports, a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses are expected in the course of the day.
Via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to United Kingdom
The inmates had travelled through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometers away.
“We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here,” one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to the postponement of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, already predicted by observers, to a somewhat further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has “comprehensive opportunities for border control.”
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a part of this since 2007, and since then the EU partners have consistently been a good witness to the country in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the night at the border crossing Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to reassure himself on Wednesday at a local show in Horgos: he considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, premature.
This is not a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: in parts of the border area there are still minefields that have not been cleared 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearers was sent to the border region.
Hacker: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals, who have been accused of gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The captured information is said to have been used to make insider transactions in the financial markets.
In this way, the investigators said, a total of over $100 million was enchanted.
“Today’s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught,” the SEC said in a statement.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Assistance Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a lot of activity.
People do their errands, sometimes quick steps, sometimes leisurely strolling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show on Paradeplatz.
Stop the city rails.
Pulsing, bulging life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large panels each with the headline "Before I want to die".
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so with the action we went to the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospital Assistance is available to passers-by for questions and conversations as well as the volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously grab the chalk and add the phrase "yes to my life", "can read", "go with the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "don't suffer for long", others stop briefly, read, say phrases like "I'm not that far yet" and then move on.
Small discussions about the action itself, about life, about how to deal with dying are constantly developing on the margins.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that the end of this world is coming for me at some point can I live in a responsible way," says the director of the diaconal works of Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the sponsor of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance.
Therefore, this public action for the 20-year-old is good.
That not everyone on the boards wants to communicate publicly, however, is understandable, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and dying is still taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to opening up people.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the topic through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance sought volunteers by call, it immediately reported and was there at the founding in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompanies the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the St. Vincent hospital.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and the experiences she has made.
“I see life from another standpoint, consider it precious, and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of confession.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tablets described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, other personal wishes can be recorded on postcards.
FedEx Results Mixed, Financial Prospects Lowered for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its earnings outlook to an entire year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it would earn a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and will take effect on 4 January and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages, which will be levied from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase over the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "returns solid revenues considering the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has caused sales in its Express shipping unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales of ground transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger parcels and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings decreased due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx stocks fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide if it’s time to raise the Leitzins for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening over them, at one end of the ornate, two-storey meeting room, is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests ahead of all other things.
The central bank has a double mandate from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive of the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economy’s data shows it is growing solidly, recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed representatives to step up this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds – even if it’s only a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing they are watching,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed is going to do, which in itself is insecure the financial market.
Approximately half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate increase this week.
However, the financial markets are expecting to wait for the Fed, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a drop in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at that time,” he said.
If she does, “she should go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will trade.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
“The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world shrank at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would throttle global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the high of May.
For Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be putting on the reins in this session,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve employee.
Now he predicts she will wait at least a month to better manage the impact.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main concerns, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint from then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “strict” its monetary expansion sparked confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global asset management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that “the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who advocates an interest rate increase, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions “despite limited noticeable impact on growth in the US,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should only prioritize aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate setting committee.
The recent turbulence is not coming close to this level, he said.
“She certainly doesn’t want to get into the situation where she’s afraid of an interest rate increase because the markets are upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewellery and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the aisles.
If the whole grocery shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is close to the cash registers and has various take-away options.
What is it here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably did.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat bar is extensive, as is the fish bar - the staff behind the bar will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it on request for you.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide gears are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well-attended, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with all her heart and soul.
She still loves to teach with her 74 lenses.
She does it every Thursday at the asylum seeker’s home on Dillinger Strasse.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from teaching at a proper school.
Brazil’s pediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is shockingly trying to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by presenting images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal councillor Bernried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernrieder Sportgelände are progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the elaborated construction application was unanimously approved without major discussions.
Previously, the panel had, among other things, decided to apply for a building "exception" or "liberation" from the valid development plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "satellite roof with a non-center first and roof supernatant" is to be erected.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will give us a wonderfully large south roof," Mayor Josef Steigenberger explained in the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof slope, which for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - should be below ten degrees.
The volume of the hall is thereby significantly reduced.
A "liberation" became necessary because the development plan regarding the roof slope does not allow "exceptions" - whereby the Bernried municipal council usually acts rather restrictively in the case of liberation applications.
However, gym building is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent with it," says Steigenberger.
The gymnasium building at the Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Approximately 2.3 million euros have been added to the costs.
Grants are expected from the school and Breitensportförderung.
In the next process step, the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the district council for examination.
Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is to be closed sooner than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the district’s Krankenhaus GmbH provide, which the county councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, a decision is made by the Supervisory Board, which will meet on Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority were to move to Schongau with Fischer and the remaining Inner Station.
The rooms are there.
Jochner-Weiß says that employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim.
Employees are informed of the plans.
The change was triggered by the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When asked who should succeed, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take over the lead from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this in any case means an "upgrading" and a broadening of the offer in the area of "Inner Medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases on the Inner Station.
For the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, should lead both houses, until next year the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, in Peißenberg will be closed after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the current renovation at the Weilheim hospital is completed.
Councillor Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed rumours that the house, which is owned by the federal government, should in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
As the property continues, Jochner-Weiß could not say there were several considerations.
Currently, there is a short-term care of the caritas and a day-to-day psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come again," Fischer said about the quasi-move to the Lech, which had been received "positively and very understandingly" by the employees.
There was no real prospect for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongauer colleagues to assume the position of Medical Director.
The hospital Peißenberg (once 100 beds) has been threatened with closure over the past few decades, departments have been closed, for example, surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are challenged at Bergischer HC tonight (20.15 p.m.).
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for pride.
Last season the Badeners made a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for there.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots.
During the butting on a cornfield near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg), several hunters were in use, police said.
After a shooting, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How the accident happened was initially unclear.
The Criminal Police investigated.
Missing 16-Year-Old from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violence Crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-old missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the young people and throwing their body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old man from Rhineland-Palatinate who had been missing since Saturday was killed in a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, the prosecution and police announced on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old suspect, who was also arrested on Tuesday night, confessed to the crime and led the investigators to the location of the corpse.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning, after she had not come home as agreed on the eve after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first came across personal belongings of the victim.
In interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing finally appeared a suspicion of the 20-year-old.
The suspect then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The detainee admitted in the police interrogation that he killed the 16-year-old and placed the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the prison judge on Wednesday, the investigators charge him with manslaughter.
The details of the incident will be revealed in further investigations.
Refugees need housing: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have already begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Association "Social Housing".
By comparison, this year 260,000 units will be produced in Germany.
There are 140,000 homes missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first-time accommodation.
Many then come across the housing market and line up in the long lines in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also makes significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit that is growing year after year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units are already missing in the metropolitan areas, Matthias Günther, author of the study, laments.
Many working people therefore lived in large cities, necessarily in WG rooms.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer at the "Hotel Mama" due to the fuss on the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Social Housing Alliance proposes a restart.
New incentives are expected to boost social housing.
Thus, the property acquisition tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidized housing could be suspended for a limited period.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The support programme for refugee accommodation of the State Bank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been retrieved on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
There is practically no longer any way through Hungary, as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow transit through Slovenia to the north without any obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
“I have spoken with the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor,” said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the isolation of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees left for Croatia to travel to Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports Croatian television channel RTL.
Hungary had closed its border on refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, make regular asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: “You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity.”
These people are there, women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
There are people who do not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbour Croatia.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived both by bus and by taxi in the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot over the green border.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border strip carries other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Miners should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, there are hardly any more refugees to Hungary after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before closing on Monday, it was 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, therefore, 35 criminal proceedings have been initiated.
The convicts face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established “transit zones”, of which almost all – 93 – were the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, there were 40 refugees.
However, practically no one has a chance to be granted asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary’s view, Serbia is a “safe third country”.
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Locking grids were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border area was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the goal of this conversion.
Only a few refugees will reach Austria after the border between Serbia and Hungary is closed.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to the government.
In Salzburg about 1,400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Trains from there to Germany were stopped this morning at the direction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
“We were busy cleaning up after Sunday’s bridge festival, when suddenly ten people were standing with luggage at the entrance of the tent,” said Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees, it was the end for them in Wernstein,” says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to Nahe Passau.
Previously, we had the unexpected guests first tasted, with snacks and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
“That was natural for us,” says Stadler in the OÖN talk.
They were very grateful.
A man did not allow himself to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased," Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to try after the short-term announcement that the train traffic to Germany was discontinued, but still across the border.
However, the regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The Brückenfest connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday socially, the day before a two-bridge race sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending us more tens of thousands is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping immediately in the Röszke camp to establish structures that ensure humanity, our Chancellor has publicly and officially put the position of the Hungarian government in the haze of National Socialism.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also find that the “promised country” they have invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the ongoing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, to create decent conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-resistant quarters
Konrad has all his hands on refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up shelters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first reception center Traiskirchen has already got Konrad under control.
“We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen,” he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without much fuss, Konrad said and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Interior Ministry, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the figure, 35,000 accommodations will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without soil," Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the provincial leaders.
They promised him that they would also create shelters for the upcoming refugees.
“It’s going well in Upper Austria,” Ferry Maier said.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, private individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
We also hope for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it cannot be that the towel holders or the size of the skylights must meet a certain height.
For a limited period of time, “emergency standards” would have to apply.
That he was more successful in housing, in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad justifies with his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not easily told the untruth in the face.
Conviction is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur any costs to the Republic, as they themselves explained.
You want to increase your number of employees to three to four.
The search for their own quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there seems to be problems with approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For now, the city of Linz is planning no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for refugee accommodation.
This is not necessary at the moment, since it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, other locations should be checked for suitability in the event of an emergency.
The head of the city criticizes the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution.
Seehofer: 'Borders are not locked off'
In a long telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), state chief Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday agreed on the further approach to the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be locked.
The further travel of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will no longer be any special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be taken to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria now also introduces controls at its borders is “a logical consequence” of the Germans’ actions.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved in, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented out to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later also acquiring some.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
S&T invested 1.7 million euros in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented out, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt-Arkade simply had to postpone this project: she has now gained growth in the form of another business venue.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, everything now revolves around women's handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Several weeks ago, it was rebuilt.
“But I’ve been thinking for a long time whether I should open another store,” says Breit.
The decision was made, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also fascinated by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the Greater Linz area selling this brand,” says the mother of two daughters, who has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put into the cradle by her mother.
I am most suited when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women get in rapture at the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the professional woman can not answer with last certainty.
Maybe it’s because a nice bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called indicators.
This feature also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he speaks xenophobicly, addresses journalists rudely or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy – the candidate for the U.S. presidential office swirls up the election campaign vigorously.
And does it well.
This is also recorded in the Palatinate town of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a familiar name for many in the wine village on the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant's place is related to him over a dozen corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädter has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, which in addition to Trump also includes the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the family’s performance, but also tends to feel that Trump is “already a bit of a big mouth,” Wendel says.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the vicinity is "Die Brulljesmacher" - to High German: the contributor, she says.
Trump is from the village.
Trump's success story began in 1885 when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold digger's place in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first real estate purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return home in the long run failed at the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not record Trump because he had once run away without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film to start.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal emigrant.”
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly despised Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“Just like the poltert, that’s not that sympathetic,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump (“The grandma was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz”).
The retired winegrower sees the American more distant, "he's always so brazen."
Does he think Trump will come?
“I can’t imagine that,” said the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm, like some Kallstadters, mentions that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
“I can’t imagine that from Donald,” says the 68-year-old.
She would be better off if he didn’t win the election, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
“It’s not my president,” she says.
“The grapes will ripen without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 moviegoers, and interest is also arousing in the US.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain climbing village".
From the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-resident village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountain climbing villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain climbing village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of leadership of the liberals, but it hasn’t made any major shifts in the ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to Monday’s ratings (317,000) and last Tuesday’s ratings (283,000), but its figure lagged behind last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has closed the sunrise gap in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for reviewing!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with Packed to the Rafters’ former serial star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night’s result answered this with a clear yes.
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million spectators and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O’Keefe, averaged 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire’s hot seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and a whopping 720,000 in the second half hour.
Hot-seat on average 620,000.
The drop in the second night’s The Chase Australia odds will give Nine confidence that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for a million-dollar minute that failed to surpass the McGuire show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man – but who will he choose?
Secret Revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who finally landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor was shrouded in secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three turns two, you may have accidentally given a clue about who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the finale on Thursday
All three women have lyrically overlooked why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers could become the game spoiler, who won the Bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
“From the moment I walked into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam’s energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet, it’s so much fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said last week’s house visit made it clear to her that Wood could be “the One.”
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was obviously not just a game – I’m now unreservedly set for him,” she said.
And when she was asked who to choose Wood, if not her, she was puzzled.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 19:30.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the U.S. – and there were many other teams that sent in inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a mess like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a point return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patchy catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne at a point restored in the first quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his NFL debut.
After the fumble, Hayne fluently left the field and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn’t imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
"That was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his Origin debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rolling field with gun violence.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Chodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts stopped.
The Free Voters are calling for the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
At the beginning of the FW autumn clause in Großwallstadt, party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a serious crisis at Bavaria’s schools when there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new students: “We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing,” Aiwanger said.
“Otherwise we will get faults in the Bavarian education system.”
The parliamentary group of the Free Voters will meet until Friday in the municipality of Unterfränkische Kommune.
Actually, quite different main topics were envisaged.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the free electoral meeting.
“Of course, the topic of asylum will overlap the clause,” Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they did during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
“This is not how it goes, we have to deal with the causes,” said the Free Electoral Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum lawsuits: “We also need at least 50 new asylum judges,” Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states throughout Germany."
"Bavaria is pushing off, others aren't."
“We need to be more capable of action.”
But state politics in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing issue remains on the agenda: education policy.
At the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot "Mittelstufe plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the middle school from three to four years is tested - as a result, it then takes again nine years to graduate.
But Aiwanger doesn’t go far enough.
“The G9 issue needs to be accelerated,” said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever you want.

4 killed after police shoot rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi District, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since 10.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – an important step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted on certain clauses in the Kathmandu draft constitution this week, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mix of trade, commerce and housing is planned – but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of land of around 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Youth Centre Alte Post.
Preparations are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, trade and housing.
We are waiting for such offers, the city says.
Which investor is involved is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / Ecke Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building located on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The planning for the holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden is taking shape.
The investor first publicly presented plans for the project.
Many residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure retreat
For months behind closed doors had been negotiated, scrambled, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented his plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council.
This point was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP faction, who accused investors and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went on the offensive from the system construction management: “We don’t have an answer to all questions yet,” he told council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to face all the rumors now.
The project costing between 10 and 12 million euros has been under discussion for months.
Heavy reactions among seabed owners who had come into the session evoked the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, sea bud owner and board member at the residents’ representation of interests, Pro Hieve, complains: “This will be a giant block that will surpass all other buildings.”
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that the traffic would increase significantly due to the intended size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads, so that this can be calculated," says Schulz.
However, what exactly happens on the site of the former restaurant, which is a good one hectare, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First, we need to have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans were still variable.
Twins at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to welcome newcomers to its gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.

NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center predicted a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, roughly in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, Miami-based weather experts added.
Google Launches Double Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people, like my family, are desperately seeking help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations will be doubled to a value of $5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It’s still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been proven effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are pathologically obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in one study, comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric hose formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained approximately the same in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments.
Among those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely resolved at 36% and at 28% in part.
In the medically-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved only in one percent and in some cases only at about two percent.
In addition, the results in controls of blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol were “generally better in the ‘surgical’ group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” – as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level – did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and was more likely to see a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people undergoing obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years – compared to a group trying more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for individuals with a BMI below 35 who were interested in the procedure.
"That's the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, with no increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with their BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard.”
Love story takes place in Hunsrück
A young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and he falls in love with her.
This is also the case in the recent novel "Actually we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be of particular interest to Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in boredom and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It's impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis, while admirable, was not appropriate to the situation.
“It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to address the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions as to how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
“The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions following the September 11 terrorist attack, pointing out that the U.S.’s violent response entailed a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is through nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in hand disinfectant intake by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12 reporting poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are coming to these products more and more often, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a social media test.
Videos on YouTube show how teens drink disinfectants just for a cheap experience.
Teens have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for it,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scent, which are very appealing for children.
Hand disinfectants contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It’s highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital’s poison emergency center, to Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn’t let a sip of whiskey stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and when kids get there, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated them at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah whispered her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children’s hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," said Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfection wipes and store hand disinfectants outside the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York State planned to poison her “common” teacher by designing antibacterial products around the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banned her from her room.
The police regarded the thwarted plan as "babble" and referred disciplinary action to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a crash on the cross-bar between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossbar towards the industrial area of the roundabout and noticed too late that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
Subsequently, he bounced his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front.
Property damage of about 10,000 euros was incurred on the vehicles involved in the accident, police say.
The 33-year-old Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed away.
Rumored kitchen: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths downplays the disharmony talk at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits the Hoops are in a bad place, but he will turn that over again.
Hearts will fight SFA over allegations of Neilson, and Warburton will be cautious about new January commitments that could destroy the squad’s unity
Dons raise leadership over Celtic to five points

Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which Griffiths spontaneously rejected, insisting that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don’t think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: “In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?”
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers returning.
You are talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of excitement in the old-firm games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to watch these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-man from Aberdeen followed, who are now clearly at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
Deila said, "Celtic had had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel the same way, but we have to go on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautiously on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new additions and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox framework.
Brentford’s ex-chief said, “The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, talking to Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he could retire if his contract with the Swans expires.

Hearts suspended on SFA battle because of Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's Red Card was later revoked - Collum's third Red Card, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson insists on what he said, “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was reproved after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-heart player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
“It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment,” the striker said, adding, “It’s safe to say that I won’t return to Tynecastle if it doesn’t play for Celtic Glasgow.”
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United’s board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around – but admits that the decline must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We’re going to get the guys back on track,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win, which earned them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in cups or leagues, that hasn't won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people unemployed for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was higher than that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the figures of the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying: “The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It’s been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunken people disrupted the process
Since the security personnel could not settle the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the disruptors into custody.
A breathing alcohol test showed 0.89 per mille in a 16-year-old.
The young man was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and was initially in custody.
Why I Will Be a Witness to Execute in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the Death Chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and as there are often more applications than places available, a more macabre lottery is held to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to 5.
Whoever is chosen will observe it without emotion.
I can't.
I’ll be sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I’ve developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story as he wants it, and you’ll get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write.
When he dies, he thinks public relations will help the death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don’t want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'll see him die.
I can’t say I’m really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to come out of Canning River after wet police hunt
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a Perth man to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, a few yards away from a police officer trying to “softly persuade him to return to the shore.”
The Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for a house peace breaking incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetting his uniform, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said senior sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s Late Scratching for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what’s best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt swab test at Lidaris, which he can’t explain.
He had restrained himself for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to “look like too high-hanging grapes.”
“I had no intention of saying anything about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around raised head, and I want my owners to think I’m trying my best for them.
If they start to think I don’t, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man – whom I will name when asked – and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I’m doing inside my stables,” Moody told Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a scammer.
If that is the case, they should certainly touch their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are.
Should that make me think it’s going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and discard me, and I have no doubt that what I’m saying will make them think about it now.
But I’ve come to the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach’s frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and late scratching led him to say he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
“One of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been that way all day yesterday, which was the case.
It was the same on race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
“We all understand that we need rules, but here you’ve gone too far,” Moody said.
Man Arrested After Driver Escape
The police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver continued to drive without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia presented himself to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driver flight and omission of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Beats Back Against Rivals for Claims on Ringfights
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of tackling his players as the "agenda setting" of two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster’s coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm players to “ring battles” with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco’s coach Wayne Bennett made a barely disguised comment on the Storm team after his team scored the final victory over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a “pattern example” of the Rugby League and saying the two from Queensland weren’t “too good” in the fight.
Bellamy defended his team’s tackling and said they were focused only on their “contact” when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team gave him confidence as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
“It keeps popping up – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us at 24:2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that’s what brought us to the turnaround.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It’s funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember St. George being criticized as a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said he was going to take care of a shit shit about it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I’m building more confidence because they say these things because they’re a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they didn’t think about us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs Roosters scored a higher result than the game Broncos vs Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points exciting?
For me, it's the schedules.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them at one stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening in the pre-finals at AAMI Park.
Serbian with $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who may face a life sentence for trying to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released for a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Solay yacht, which came from South America over Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-defendants in the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about Maksimovic’s danger of escape.
He has a clear relationship with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 security deposit together to reach his release.
"After reading the two people's affidavits, it's clear that imposition of a $200,000 security is a real financial burden," Justice Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, on the condition that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, contacts the police daily and sticks to a curfew from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on the A5 near Karlsruhe: driver's cab tears apart
In a crash with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three involved trucks had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment, police said.
The driver’s cab of the cause of the accident was completely torn apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours to 2 o’clock.
Damage amounted to 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg Used Girls' Phone to Entice Pedophiles to Send Pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone when this one slept, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of nasty pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered "concerning" web research using terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to “pedophiles on the Internet” and then he “pretended to be a police officer to scare them off.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court, "He said it was an addiction -- that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were done by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the defendant used computer and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment of taking indecent pictures of children on June 14, last year, breaching the terms on January 25 of this year, and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was included in the sexual offender list before the date of the verdict.
smugglers leave on small border crossings with Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the large checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest.
On the Austrian side, a spokesman for the Federal Police said.
Along the Inn border river, more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and congestion defences.
There they are received by federal policemen and forwarded to registration.
According to the Federal Police, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
Around 700 people had arrived in the state capital by 8:00 a.m. alone, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Tropensturm "Henry" in the southwest expected
Meteorologists warn of storm gusts in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, said the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart.
The strong low is the foothill of the tropical storm "Henry", which has moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are mainly expected in Baden.
According to the DWD, winds of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can be expected in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance Circle until Thursday.
On Friday, the sun will look longer.
The crowd does it: every two years, the carmakers at the IAA show their new products.
In 2015, there was mainly movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: According to the German Federal Motor Authority (KBA), around 28.1 percent of the new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (September 17 to 27).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new premium and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the dealerships in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It is part of the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel offers an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder gasoline engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the Kombi, which can already be seen at the IAA.
And what is going on in addition to the Astra at the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the trade fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door model in a conventional and a sporty GT version.
He will be on the market at the beginning of next year, then also as a station wagon.
Infiniti: New in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the brand’s design line.
The base model will have a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
But there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model will be offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The sale of the Baleno in Europe starts in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën boom put mainly hand on the front: Here the grille was redrawn and the changed headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and for the first time Apple’s CarPlay integrated.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI will be added in the compact class at the IAA.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five-square-foot cell is inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has justified an ex-detainee of the Tegel prison, who was housed in a cell too small for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were confined in the confined rooms for only a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
An ex-detainee was thus successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not separated spatially.
Afterwards, the man, who according to his lawyer is now again on free foot, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His official liability lawsuit for the unworthy conditions of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
But the constitutional judges revoked the ruling of the Berlin Chamber Court and dismissed the case there for re-examination.
You see the human dignity of the man hurt.
The Court of Appeal now decides on the amount of compensation.
Even if for legal reasons of the period in question only a few days of detention are decisive for the compensation, there is a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, "a loss of legal protection of the personality would be to be feared."
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the compensation.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they only awarded damages to a prisoner in April because he was imprisoned naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also inhumane.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane accommodation.
For three months, the plaintiff was housed in a cell of the same type as in the Karlsruhe case, between 15 and 21 hours a day.
The Berlin prisons had also come into the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore kept in custody for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even fights are said to have already come because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not filled due to a shortage of young people, 19 should be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: “We can do this”
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge – the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
Around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accept one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: “I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do it.”
What lies ahead for Germany is given in the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years.
That’s almost twice as much as what has been built to date (25,000 apartments).
The shortage of housing is dramatic, but especially for affordable rental properties: 60000 to 80000 social housing are excluded from the rent-price bond every year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favorable housing.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Ministry of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Research, it can be assumed that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contact, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political change in Germany: from the ban on refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was previously a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence obligation, which limited asylum seekers to one place of residence.
The majority of people in society, also because of the shortage of skilled workers, have adopted the view that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market faster.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is the lack of German language skills.
To date, there are not enough general and occupational language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
According to Thränhardt, the construction of networks is therefore the king’s way to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the nursery, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes leaflets in different languages.
Should the demand for female educators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example by allowing more technical schools.
In the countries, students without knowledge of German are prepared for the lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin school administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient students from studying - the only exception so far was Berlin, but Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Student-ready refugees could be facilitated access to higher education.
Because refugees with a residence permit or toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applicant Benefits Act when they start their studies.
In principle, the latter do not receive a Bafög because they do not fall under the circle of Bafög persons.
Patient refugees had to live in Germany for four years so far in order to be entitled to Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this range is reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk demand.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, as many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the new arrivals professionally.
Rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control options.
This includes the willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany “have immediately forfeited their right to stay here, in Germany,” he said on Bavarian Radio.
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more an issue for society than it is today.
As a result, the majority society will also have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a General Equality Act for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention oblige Germany to do must become a reality in the next few years, if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide the previously expected refugees with medical care, says physician Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As far as manpower and capacities are concerned, we can do that,” he told Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money has to go into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks all arrivals to hand over health cards at the same time when registering.
Services provided could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited service catalog provided for by the Asylum Applicant Benefits Act.
Otherwise, the doctors mainly create the language barriers.
The Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has already proven that migrants are less informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreting costs have to be covered, she demands.
Many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and the young people are concerned with HIV education.
However, with the partly other illnesses, German doctors came clear from their education, Montgomery says.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect". And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, perhaps even relief in sight by the refugees.
The Syrians have a sophisticated education system, and many refugees are even doctors.
In order to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to the Federal Psychotherapist’s Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, says Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study published by the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, among other things, suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rate and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe dreadfulness, and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees are receiving psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses usually decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal dressing and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the manege on the brick.
“Our passion is the circus.”
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, an animal teacher and junior boss.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current manege production.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
“It’s important to us to get people away from their everyday routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” emphasizes the 27-year-old junior boss.
"Manegencocktail mit Weltstadt-Flair", that is what director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometre tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of silent films, the Cuban duo wants to record it loosely.
Ease and agility - with these words they identify.
Her humorous art on the mast is to conquer women’s hearts in a storm.
Apart from numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with fingertips and articulation.
Balancing with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and terrify at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the attitude of circulated animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each petting unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read from the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn’t feel well, it doesn’t want to go to the manege either.
The most important thing is to take good care of the animals.
Especially for her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPony stallion and a Zebra Mare, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals lived together for eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened.
“But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there,” Brigitte Probst says.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
“One thing is certain,” says Stephanie Probst, “whether it’s five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with our whole heart.”
The Circus Probst invites you to his performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 and 8 p.m.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe to Speak Falsely in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of the parliament was also clouded by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr. Mugabe’s speech with screams.
Last month, they had bent him down and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament – this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones warning them not to disturb Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity in Parliament will end, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was “concerned” about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving efforts in the company’s services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
The expected job cut leads to a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business,” said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering unprecedented, integrated technology solutions to businesses,” the company said in a statement.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone massive restructuring to address the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP’s move, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in the field, based on the belief that tightly focused companies are performing better.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must be behind injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger emphasized to Wilshere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had severely ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then had recovered to his old momentum during the preseason.
“This type of injury doesn’t threaten the career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had previously.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs with the most injuries in six of eight seasons since 2007/08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes an improvement in injury rate will continue during the last season.
“Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident he will and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal will start its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger will make a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little break,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating playgrounds in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal has drawn the lessons from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
“This drive is immense,” Wenger said.
It has never worked out at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The Comedy Show That Gives Us Serious Lessons About Men's Friendships
The lack of similar portrayals on shows is obvious, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common among men than women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with “healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first, so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can’t really buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of watching soccer in cosy armchairs, and Ross’ longing for Rachel – all came from knowing that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As one employee of the telephone chaplainhood explained to me, "my listening role to people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying “I can handle it” has a huge effect, like the feeling that it’s perceived as weakness when you talk about problems openly.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men’s friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you’re visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk?
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - the total of 236 episodes - for  “FriendsFest”
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his Champions League debut on Tuesday and helps PSG pass by Malmö.
Here is the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held track when Paris Saint-Germain kicked off his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria hit less than four minutes after starting his Champions League debut as a PSG player who got the French champion on the way, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they are not only aiming for qualifying for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn’t a class game of Laurent Blanc’s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s missed chances in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career as early as 1999.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League at home or abroad, so it's a good start to win 2-0, cause problems to our opponents, and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn’t score one or two more goals.”
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which was able to hold a 2-2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was punched in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing striker was referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Verratti’s pass behind the Malmö defense before finishing nicely past Johan Wiland in the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would make a big victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, competed at Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two lined up deep in the midfield.
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed Kevin Trapp’s posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up on itself, with some bad passes and bad finishes, not least by Ibrahimovic, who brushed in no less than five attempts in the first half alone and was then given up after Cavani had used him after rebooting.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill in bringing his teammates into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shot, which Wiland passed by the post in the 52nd minute ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, and the Uruguayan scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland at a short distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
Malmö’s coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League match was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
Qualifying games are not enough.”
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, affected by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about $1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating effect on markets.
The issuance of subscription rights brought Glencore’s stock price to the top of the London Stock Exchange early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of its broader plans to pay off around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new stakes at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday’s closing price.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.9 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have dropped by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees Arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city council in Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will respond to President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosting Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders have had bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide the opportunity to expand US-Chinese cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement,” the statement added.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on its way to Washington before moving on to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and his growing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports car borrowed and scrapped
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in the district of Gotha, you can fulfill your dream and borrow and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
This is what a 29-year-old from Gotha County did.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, fell on a wet road and drove into the board.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage to property is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented switching to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was obviously close to the commitment of Spain’s superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times Club World Champion, two times European Champion, one time World Champion - Xavi's title list is stunning.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already before the 2008 European Championship before the farewell from Barcelona.
"They told me that Barca wanted to sell me."
“Madrid won everything at the time, we won nothing,” he says.
And so did FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: “Barca signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship.”
“Pep told me that I wouldn’t change, that he couldn’t imagine the team without me.”
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season would have been with Xavi?
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, turned off the reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the king-class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a Sunday Night episode of HBO’s Project Greenlight, experienced actor Brown interrupted as she stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project’s chosen screenplay.
“If we’re talking about diversity, you’re doing it when casting the movie, not when casting the show,” Damon said.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted disbelief, shouting "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as the actor's comments from The Martian consolidated.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think about – whoever will be the director – how they treat the character of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she's a whore beaten by her white pimp.
Dear White People’s producer advocated for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the film’s directing rights; Damon replied that their directing “could end up giving us something we don’t want.”
After the discussion was aired, social media exploded with disapproval of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing, “Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity – that’s SO WIT that it hurts.”
The tweet has earned over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved nationwide impact, urging legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against Colored.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The network Black Lives Matter is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers, and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior crowns first champion
Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and take home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never seen a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task included climbing on a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time, making him the first athlete to complete the exhausting Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished this challenge full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!Nachrichten after the hard-won victory, still shocked by the win of the $1 million Grand Prix.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about it, I’ve never made or had more than $10,000 to live,” Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine what this is like... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, does not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If there is more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time will get it,” Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he receives the great gratification.
I don’t think he has any resentment about it.
He was so happy to do what he did.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone beat me, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins squandered an opportunity to climb within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that was so hard to grasp for much of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) scored 6 times in the 1/3 innings and made three runs possible.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to end this year strongly,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in bullpen, so I want to go into the game very concentrated.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the log well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at training, he looked much better at bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks scored a bunch, and Simon took his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy surrendered to Wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated rookie bat Miguel Sano, who escaped the right-hander Drew Verhagen a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the final run on the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer made an RBI double against the closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the stand of 5-4.
The right-hander, however, stood out Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from an immovable Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injured list before the game after missing for more than a month due to back pain.
“Obviously not the beginning I wanted,” Hughes said, “but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning.”
After receiving the leadoff battery in the first, Hushes handed over a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, managed another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers scored in the second, scored a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center leader Anthony Gose for the 3-0.
“That was a big blow,” Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't beat very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by the relief right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
Notes: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez resigned due to injury to the throwing shoulder.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, on the injured list since mid-August for a shoulder strap, is to be activated for the launch on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 on four Tigers starts since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 because of a rupture in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to stay in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who traveled in it would then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, 7,500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the government presidency responsible for the initial admission.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria as a possibility.
“I believe that decisive reflection on military options must not take place without Germany,” he said.
He accused the European states of “collectively looking the way.”
Four years ago they were glad that the chalice of military involvement had passed to Germany.
“Now the conflict ends blazingly on our doorstep,” he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian TV channel ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany did not send refugees back to Austria either.
“No, that’s agreed,” she said.
Asked about an agreement under which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been discussions in this regard between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany began temporary border controls on Sunday.
EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
The EU’s interior ministers plan to take a new start at a special meeting on Tuesday (22 September) for the binding distribution of another 120,000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee urgency in Germany, the Federation wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussions with the Prime Minister in the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those people who need protection would get it too.
But anyone who has no prospect of staying in Germany can not stay either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a “huge effort”.
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometer border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country, unlike Serbia, belongs to the EU.
Hungary wanted to prevent traffickers from seeking escape routes over Romania, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said to the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands of more migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Cassini finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Underneath the ice tank of Saturn’s moon Enceladus is a global ocean.
This is what researchers conclude from observations made by the Cassini spacecraft.
Thus, the moon is slightly staggering on its orbit around the ring planet.
This wobble is only small, but still too big for a solid solid celestial body, a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, said on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
Cassini had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of the Saturn moon in 2006, which spawn water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least there must be an underground sea at the South Pole, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing in 1860 Munich for several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to give up about a month of offensive actor Valdet Rama.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had already complained of pain earlier this week.
According to the Munich Lion, the diagnosis means “probably four weeks of forced rest.”
"It's hard for us, Rama is a hard loss."
“Of course we have to think now,” said sporting director Necat Aygün to the “Bild” newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an ununited professional.
However, as a training guest, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously already under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian has "the opportunity to prove his ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
The Austrian national player is expected to start running training on Thursday.
Okotie was injured in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent clash on the head.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But whoever wants to watch his slim line, is often discouraged by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruit thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell.
The shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
However, a mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. parcel service UPS is hiring up to 95000 aids for the Christmas business in the U.S..
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Drivers are mainly sought after.
Already last year, UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95000 allowances.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been taking precautions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business.
In 2013, delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to parcel services.
First föhnsturm, then distinctive cold front
Next night, in the valleys of the Alps north side, the hair dryer breaks through, Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the hairdryer blows partly with stormy strength through the föhn valleys.
After rehearsals on Thursday morning, a distinctive cold front crosses us, bringing heavy rains, wind gusts and a drop in temperature.
According to MeteoNews, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area across the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the north side of the Alps, the hair dryer breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday.
As a result, the hairdryer blows until Thursday morning in the Föhn valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland sometimes at over 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can penetrate in places to the neighboring central country, and on the mountains even hurricanes of over 120 km / h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryer provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to accumulate on the Alpine south slope.
There is rain that lasts until Thursday.
In total, over the next 48 hours, over 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected south of the Alps, after large amounts of rain have fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer runs out of the air, as a result of which a cold front rolls from west to east via Switzerland with strong, partly thunderstorms.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north at 15 to 20 degrees, in the south, on the other hand, it becomes sunnyer and warmer at up to 25 degrees on the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed place in the park on Oppio Hill was baptized in the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name had been requested by the Association of Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Popes could only live their faith in secret for centuries as a minority.
The place symbolically shows that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent several months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
At that time, he felt the city was a depraved scapegoat.
His negative impressions, according to historians, may have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the indulgence trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt-Bibel, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has received his "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" images.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite bleak.
For about three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have been created that deal with topics such as the Way of the Cross, Plagues, Commandments or Our Father.
With this, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the scriptures selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated them into the present day, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt’s painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quotation of Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"That's where the upbringing happened with the cane," Otmar Alt recalls.
“I’ve tried to work this up, maybe to get along with the Lord’s Father again.”
His second concern is to help art become more important again in a fast-paced time: "The perception of image worlds is characterised today by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being displaced.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to let themselves "fall" into the images, to let them affect themselves, to discover and to feel what power they have: "The image seeks its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible at the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "already" to have been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not take care to fully understand the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him, even mysterious.
Altepost says: "This was not an eye-to-eye collaboration, it's about the images, the text just explains."
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation "to deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung on 15 November.
Construction begins for BMX train approaching
Plans made, space found, companies commissioned, earth hills modelled for a round course: a year later almost everything was done - but even before the official opening of the BMX railway it was already over.
Failures in politics and administration caused grief, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hills deported, new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permits.
First councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was able to inform the Children’s and Youth Committee of the approval will be received in October.
“I hope something more visible will happen this year,” she said.
The work at the former indoor pool should then be started without a "further pause of commemoration".
DFB strengthens its commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is setting a clear signal this weekend.
Football responds to the rising situation in Germany and assures the politicians of their help in tackling the problems ahead.
“I think this is the biggest challenge our country has faced since reunification.”
“In principle, no one can say that it’s not my business, I have nothing to do with it.”
“Everyone must be interested in getting a grip on this issue,” said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
“I’ll be at the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Ms. Özouz, and the Chancellor.”
“The issue will certainly play a central role,” he said.
Football can and will help.
However, the decisive course must be taken by politics.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
“Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019,” Niersbach said at the UEFA meeting in St. Julian’s/Malta.
Some Germans also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign, if they will wear the imprint "We help - 'refugeeswelcome'" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can help," said Leverkusen's sporting director Rudi Völler to the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "natural".
“The refugee drama affects everyone, no one can look away.”
“We football Bundesliga players can, no, we need to use our radiance, influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,” Hertha manager Michael Preetz said.
Hoffenheim’s CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a “prominent sign of the league”.
The women’s national team will be inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Qualifiers against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a large joint effort of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensing associations started their own projects in their places is great.
It’s just as great that small and small clubs are active.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.
“This is of enormous importance,” he said.
In this and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will each provide 300,000 euros for the integration of refugees.
“The clubs have already called up the entire sum for 2015,” Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
Europe’s largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the United States, he fell after midnight on a water glass, which he had worn in his left hand, reports the "economic week" on Wednesday.
“He was almost bleeding, faint, then dragged himself out onto the street – that’s what he told us last week,” said Hasso Plattner, co-founder of WiWo.
McDermott can do his job.
"In early October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was at the meeting and "fully able to work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full for SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott told SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It’s important to him to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the “SZ” said: “Everyone can do something like that.”
“It’s important to get up when you fall down.”
McLaren Replacement Pilot Magnussen
Magnussen tweeted a photo and said he suffered the injury when he fell off the bike.
He is therefore not eligible as a reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore at the weekend, as well as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group match of the Europa League have finally broken.
The national player will also be missing from the Bundesliga leader in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 o'clock / sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot rely on him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday."
Given the heavy burden on his pros, Tuchel will not only change his tribal elf on the Giant position.
So he announced a change in the gatekeeper position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all European League games in the future, however, left Tuchel unanswered.
He is also very likely to play the second game.
The remark by fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, thinks midfielder Julian Weigl comprehensible: "Marco is not so wrong."
“I think we have a good chance of picking up the title.”
Robotic cars: Government wants a pioneering role for Germany
According to the German government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the car fair IAA of a "new mobility era".
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
Among other things, the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a swift transition to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being developed on the motorway 9 in Bavaria.
So that the driver "no additional liability risks are burdened up", the Federal Government wants to "review the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt them to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to raise the maximum speed allowed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.
The German government also wants to work for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In the case of automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver is becoming more and more a passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads “are to be expected far beyond 2020.”
The authors of the study estimate that the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany will be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD transport policymaker Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars as sceptical – much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organisation Dekra, presented on Wednesday at the AA, concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent only expect it in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, while 33 percent expect autonomous cars in the United States.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to hand over control on all roads during the entire journey.
On the highway, this could be imagined in flowing traffic at least 15 percent, in traffic jams 45 percent.
Nearly one in four would not be allowed to control the car under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at Tischtennis-EM
According to the current status, the Düsseldorfer only wants to hit in detail at the title matches from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision should be made on 22 September at the latest.
“This is a huge loss for our team.
“The boys knew this in the morning.”
"But we are strong enough to win the title without Timo," said Federal Coach Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight for a long-term agreed sponsorship date in China at that time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
Timo was missing at the time, too, and we have become European champions.
"That's what we should orientate ourselves to," said the world rankings fifth.
English footballer Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
At the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was beaten in a tackling by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a sham fracture in Bastian Schweinsteiger’s 20-year-old player.
Gaultier Feels Too Old for an Enfant Terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure grusel cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna’s stage outfits – and with the fact that he put men in skirts.
“I can no longer say that I am the Enfant Terrible of Haute Couture because I have white hair.”
"It used to be bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk, which will be on display in the Art Hall of the Hypo-Culture Foundation from September 18, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
Actually he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris, Canada.
“It’s about so much more than just beautiful clothes,” said Roger Diederen, director of the Kunsthalle.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the barely oversighted work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
The show is not chronologically structured, but it is an excellently choreographed overall work of art, for which a lot of effort was put into it: for example, a stylist was engaged in order to freeze the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material were transported to Munich.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women (“women are smarter than men”) and people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier’s old Teddy is also on display at the exhibition.
It stands for the designer’s first, timid, fashionable walks.
As a child (he wasn’t a good student and bad in football), he put on his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll would not have been allowed by his parents.
He later taught himself to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
I bought them later, of course.
For his first fashion show, he could not pay the models.
They didn’t get anything, but they were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze als Mode-Nische
Previously, the long embroidery machines in and around plaudits were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were produced in large quantities for customers, who processed them, for example, to create blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the fashion company Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a bigger role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewellery, in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style periods, creates an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Modespitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze und Stickereien.
Only you can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have broken away.
Private specialty stores and also the wholesale trade are almost no longer available.
Our products barely reach the customer in this way.
The bulk goods are nowadays produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed via chains.
Exports are also weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
There are plenty of reasons for new paths.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been holding a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: “This also relates to the materials used.”
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon University of Applied Arts in Zwickau - and specializes in embroidery and lacework.
In order to counteract the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which have to think economically,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine sticks small beads in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krausse was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't do anything with traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a memorial.
With this, I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney is planning a new “Mary Poppins” movie.
You shouldn't touch legends, but Disney still dares to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to Entertainment Weekly, this is not a remake, but a kind of sequel that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It’s about the nanny’s experience with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Who plays poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy more broadly to the world
The economy needs to open up wider outwards to foster growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group tasked with steering the reform.
“China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving strategies for business start-ups,” he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list for regulating market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), taking up private capital, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is created identifying the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is significant as it assigns the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a rule of law business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also ease control over the powers conferred on the companies and ensure that companies decide how to run their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened for private investment.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of third-party-funded companies and provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
Guaranteeing the right of lawyers to carry out their duties and appointing professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus expect consumers to have a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury that about 50 percent of the catches cannot be sold on the basis of the still applicable limits.
After doubling the limits, only 14.5 percent would be unavailable.
In return for this easing, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch called this a "trick" because smaller Friedfish, such as carp, are usually so low-loaded that they already meet the planned highs today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction maneuver that alone helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal highly toxic to humans, which accumulates heavily in the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn children."
However, the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum levels that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury gets into the environment mainly through coal combustion.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury per year to the Greens’ parliamentarian Annalena Baerbock, two-thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and comprehensively exceeded," the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU’s RASFF warning system.
