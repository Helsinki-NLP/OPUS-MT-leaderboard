The swelling is due to the surface tension of the water.
This is due to the fact that the water molecules on the surface of the water are more powerful than the air molecules on the surface of the water.

The ridge of a modern sledge has a double edge with a concave ridge. The two ridges allow a better speed on the ice, even if the ridge is inclined.
As the blade of the ground is crimped, the edge of the blade is crimped, and the edge is in contact with the ice, when the blade is tilted from one side to the other.
If the sledge is tilted to the right, the sledge is tilted to the right, if the sledge is tilted to the left, then the sledge is tilted to the left.
In order to reclaim their previous energy level, they must let go of the extra energy they received from the light.
They do this by emitting a winged light particle called "photon".
Scientists call this process "stimulated radiation emission", because the atoms of the bright light are stimulated, causing the emission of a light photon, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next image shows the atoms that emit photons. Of course, photons and reality are much smaller than those in the image.
Photons are even smaller than the material that atoms represent!
