Fire in French chemical plant cleared
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, considered to be particularly dangerous, has been erased. The Normandy prefecture said this on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire trucks.
The fire could be stopped.
Neighbors were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work at the plant. The chemical factory already made headlines in the past - for example, when gas methanthiol escaped from a leak in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, around 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing bitch for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short break in Montana. 57 days were missing from the bitch - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was horrible. I got sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went for dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had caused the dog to panic
In the hope that Katie could still be somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four or four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic front door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for her beloved dog. But days became weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake, which quit her job as a postal employee to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man reported and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered, "I knew the whole neighborhood.
Losses at the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The whereabouts are unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "fearful" extent.
Weapons and ammunition have always disappeared in the Bundeswehr - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 shots of ammunition. This is evident from a list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which the editorial network Germany reports on.
According to the paper from the office of Defence Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one part of the weapon and 3474 shots of ammunition have so far reappeared. The still missing weapons and parts of the weapon include six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven rifles of the type G3, four rifles of the type G36, six signal guns of the type MG8.
The extent of gun and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr is "fearsome", said the Bundestag MEP Martina Renner. This is all the more true, since hardly anything was found again in the course of the investigation. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance sheet". Renner criticized the fact that the list was not visible to the under-exploit.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its detention by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker sat in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was declared as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that they wanted to wait for an official notice from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was accused on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Hormuz Strait of breaching security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial, temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker in front of British-owned Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have exacerbated immensely in recent months. Trade shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Merkel acknowledges the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has acknowledged the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago in the Peaceful Revolution. In the fall of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt.
Musk is aiming for extradition record
Tesla’s quarter may hold a record, despite the delivery boom, there have been recent losses to the electric car group.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost in the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
Demand is strong, so Tesla could make 110,000 orders, Musk’s newsletter continued. The challenge is to get the cars to the customer quickly. To do this, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible at the quarter end.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with an increase of over six percent. The price has not been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well over 95000 cars, reaching its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400,000 cars. This will require six-digit figures in the current and next quarters. The cheapest Tesla Model 3 in particular is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Mysteries solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebral cortex prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found this through experiments on rats, as they communicated on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made in the question of why children fight so strongly against tickling, only to then demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why just approaching a tickling hand even before the touch triggers laughter. This is due to a low layer in the cerebral system, which already triggers the laughter when expecting the tickling.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats react with "laughs" in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans, which is conveyed by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-contact
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and contact by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out in the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-contact. This is also the case when the impulse of the brain itself has been brushed.
But if the self-contact and the contact with others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between the self-contact and the contact with others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-contact activates a brake in the cerebral brain.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. In the experiment, they therefore sometimes stopped this initiation prematurely, showed escape behaviors or ambivalence. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The tickle ambivalence is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Large fire in French chemical plant erased
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, considered to be particularly dangerous, has been erased. This was reported by the Normandy prefecture to the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire had erupted in the night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances were leaked. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. Nobody was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes, buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session in parliament after lifting the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country without an agreement from the EU on October 31, should Brussels not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement, but how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
Speaking of Cox, who had advocated Britain’s retention in the European Union, the prime minister said: “The best way to honor Jo Cox’s memory and reunite this country would be to make the EU exit.”
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya attacks unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a memorial in honor of the victims is unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They remind of the roses that had dropped by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
At the same place, the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. The opening is expected, among others, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On July 22, 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik detonated a car bomb in the Oslo government district and subsequently shot down dozens of participants in a youth camp on the island of Utöya.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN General Debate brought no solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", held in Iran, was able to get back to sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Rohani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, Stena Bulk said.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said chief of the shipping company Erik Honell. By midday, the ship has left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told the Swedish television channel SVT.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to compromise the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," the statement said.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker on July 19 on charges of disregarding maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, said Honell. They would have acted again quickly in view of the difficult and rubbing situation in the past ten weeks.
The British government suspected behind the arrest of the "Stena Impero" a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar: there, at the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposedly destined for Syria, had been put on the chain. The delivery violated EU sanctions against the war country Syria, according to the authorities.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Suspicions that it was a barter to get the "Stena Impero" free, London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Trade shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The US had so far left the international nuclear agreement alone in 2018, which was to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pushing the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for the military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protective powers.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war winner". Given the punitive tariffs imposed by America's President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-dispose to 1.3 billion. Financial leaders of Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country, India in a UBS survey does not seem to play an important role in the huge domestic market.
But now India itself has become Trump’s focus. Depreciating the White House as the “Kingdom of Tariffs”, America withdrew the trade advantage for 2,000 products in early June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the friction with India is, of course, only a side scene. In addition, America also looks at the world's largest democracy through security glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's claims of power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvage of American penal duties against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is likely to take up a second office
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically-strengthened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development is in a difficult situation in the Socialist Republic of India. Even under modes. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies now receive faster building permits and a more insolarity law.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. Out of economic optics, much has changed for the better in India in the first five modes years. But this is not the case in trade policy. Inspired by the desire to protect internationally less competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even set new barriers.
In the West, modes adhere to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country economically. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At its core, however, the "India First" advocate never drifted away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents the Indian companies from being forced to survive the abys.
Jacques Chirac's funeral in Paris on Monday
Former French President Jacques Chirac is said to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the AFP news agency reported, citing the family Chirac. The funeral will take place in a close family circle. A public funeral ceremony was scheduled for Sunday in the Paris Invalidendom, media reported.
Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championship
The top of the world was already in the goal, when in the cooled Khalifa International stadium heartwarming scenes took place. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to sway dangerously. He could barely hold himself on his feet well 300 meters before the finish, ran in an unhealthy bent post, when Braima Suncar Dabo would have been enough to support him in the final rounds of the West African country Guinea-Bissau.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly drew the attention of the assembled journalists. He first shyly avoided, didn't want to talk about his heroism at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized this would be difficult, he didn't want to be proud of the country.
He did so that evening with insistence - and much more intense than he thought he would have. Because this heroic act will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even left his competitor Busby the lead in the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, nothing was used by the world, because it was just with a lot of help.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had started to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, it did with 18:10.87 minutes, but he was himself disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes". However, only in training, best times do not count.
Millions' Mesh: Egyptians Prepare for Wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible pro-government protests. At the center of Cairo on Friday there was an increased police presence. Several subway stations were closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
In the past few days, the police had stepped up their road controls and searched the phones of pedestrians in part for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds were arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there had come to protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They called on the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic, to blame for corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, living in Spanish exile, has called on the country's sub-Marsions for Friday.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase, according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures were initially not independently confirmed. The government also confirmed and commented on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have been "arbitrarily arrested" "only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW said, citing lawyers arrested. The allegations against the detainees range, according to their lawyers, from "proliferation of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association".
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, according to which the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services in order to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail order merchants should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While the companies could not be exempted from VAT on donations in kind, the ministry said on a question of the Greens-Bundestag faction, about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday, but the traders could set the market value of the unavailable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little sales tax.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens send back every sixth parcel when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then ended up in the trash. Donating them would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities assess material donations as a turnover, which then applies to VAT.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies can evaluate non-sale products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. The companies should be able to rely on not to be punished for donations. This applies not only to online retail, but also to other stores from shop to fashion.
Banksy art for auction: There has never been a better time to sell this painting
Streetart star Banksy’s Devolved Parliament will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksy’s work underlines “the regression of the world’s oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude shaped by animals and tribes”. From Saturday, the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby’s in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on October 3. It is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in southwestern Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Last Wednesday, at the first session of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, after the lifting of a forced break by the Supreme Court, delivered a hard blow exchange with the opposition. Johnson wants to make the already twice postponed Brexit on October 31, if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered with the Brexit debate. In Dover, in the southeast of England, he painted a picture of a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. The plant sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the UK every day.
Brexit debate is like a “walk in the park”
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the election campaign ahead of the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a “walk in the park,” Dominic Cummings said in a book presentation on Friday. “We will enjoy it. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win”.
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days, accusing them of, among other things, “trading” the people, accusing them of putting MPs at risk because they might become targets of murder threats, he dismissed as “humbug.”
Cummings said the only way to rest is if the MEPs finally respect the British decision to leave the EU, and it is not surprising that people are upset that Britain still has not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In light of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. “We should speak with respect to each other,” it said in a statement. “And we should also listen.”
Pakistani Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN General Debate in New York. "If it goes bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers dominate part of Kashmir and another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had deprived the Indian Kashmir region of autonomy, thus dramatically increasing tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water.
The protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It fires the population with sharp ammunition, over 2,000 detainees join the 60,000 political prisoners already in prison. Protesting in Egypt has never been safe. But since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario like that of the Arab era.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by the government drove millions on the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi cannot handle, no matter how hard it is against adversaries. The situation has even worsened.
Today, one third of Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is at ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the largest economic player. The military is always building streets, houses, football stadiums, producing food and much more.
TÜV tests in the terminal: BER boss: no more "show stops" for capital airport
For two months, it was checked whether the complex system braid works in conjunction with the BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the course. But the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the supervisory board.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we do not have a real showstopper", he assured, the schedule before commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the Construction Office in the course of the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables have yet to be fixed; the TÜV wants to examine them by February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work must continue to be done on the settlement of the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dowels on which the cable routes hang. The head of the airport expects that this will be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not yet work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that shut down in a fire like a canvas, so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 motors must therefore be replaced. Then there are new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree flaws as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally it was to go into operation in 2011. The costs have increased from two billion euros to approximately 6.5 billion euros at the opening next year since the start of construction in 2006.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has since increased significantly, the responsible parties are planning to expand the airport, which is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board should take place on 18 October, as the chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance chief Heike Fölster is moving to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen is retiring next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Machines for drugs blown up – police arrest a man
He needed money for drugs - and for that he hunted up a number of machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
In the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines blown up in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police caught a 33-year-old German on Bürgerstraße and on Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation for the cause of explosive explosions in crime with a particularly serious case of the theft carried out by the Chemnitz crime police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the prey, he apparently financed his narcotic addiction." Four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on the Bürgerstraße.
The resulting total damage amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The vending machine bomber is now in custody, and police investigations against him continue.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automatic blasts in Chemnitz and neighboring counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price battle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," a spokesman for Austrian Airlines confirmed to APA on Friday.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airliner Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning. The flight times will be coordinated with connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and on the other hand to expand decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "Production Company" for the Group sister AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. The on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings.
After the Niki plea, a price battle broke out at Vienna Airport. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airliner sends four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticized as a circumvention construct to the collective agreement.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary’s battle statement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, said Andreas Otto, CEO of AUA, on Friday: “We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years.”
Queen's granddaughter Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four get married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Earlier this month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped by the hand of his girlfriend, Princess Beatrice (31).
“We’re extremely excited to announce our engagement, and we’re both so excited to start this adventure together and can’t wait to actually be married,” the couple, who have been together since October 2018, said in the official statement.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have been taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29) – and posted on her Instagram account.
A royal celebration
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information about the date, location and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
But it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession to the throne and the real estate mogul will be a celebration similar to Eugenie’s wedding with Jack Brooksbank on October 12, 2018 (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diets - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetics of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetics of 9,000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out in more detail the causes of cardiovascular disease.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, said the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High Mountain Clinic Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and an unhealthy diet are among the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors also determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known. Now, the scientists want to compare the entire genome of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the University Cardiovascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to cause possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations, the clinic said.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in researching other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New insights into the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancers are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is a strong desire to use the data for researching other diseases. The clinic of the foundation in Davos has so far mainly treated allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be created on the medical campus there and a professorship of bioinformatics in open-hearted Hamburg.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world. In the case of genetic decryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Mochsp University.
Today, according to the UKE, a person’s genetic material can be decrypted within 24 hours. The pure physical cost for this is 1,300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is to begin on 1 October, and all 9,000 samples are to be analyzed at the end of 2020. The first results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian Police Release Hundreds of Abused Boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Quran school. According to local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom are still minors, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them reported to have been raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Qur'an, and in fact the protégés were held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
The Koran school has been in existence for about ten years, according to the information. Residents have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents were shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They did not know about the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have therefore fled across the border to the neighboring country Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police free 400 children from school
Police officers have released nearly 400 students from horrible conditions in a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture," said Yakubu Sabo, a police spokesman in the city of Kaduna.
There, the children were discovered on Thursday after a hint in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "inhumane". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were kept as slaves at their school and chained, some sexually abused, and television footage showed lean and injured students in recognizable poor health.
World Footballer Election: More Accusations After Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Cup awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he had never voted in the world footballer’s election, accusations come from other countries to FIFA. Egypt was not valued at all – with a curious justification.
In recent years, much of FIFA has proved to be faulty: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials, but the FIFA World Cup election has not yet been suspected of running out of purity - provided that the voting-righted national coaches or national team members vote rather according to the member associations than the national team.
However, after Nicaragua’s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies now emerge: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account.
FIFA apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid" and has contacted the Egyptian Federation several times to clarify the situation - without answering.
Sudan’s coach is also surprised.
While the situation in the case of Egypt is comprehensible, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the way it was ultimately assessed: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in two, and Sadio Mané in three. According to Fifa, the vote was just as official as that of the association.
Nicaragua’s captain Juan Barrera also said: “Don’t vote for the TheBest2019 Awards. All the details about my vote are wrong, thanks,” he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted on his behalf.
The message from the association came on Friday: True, but of course it was not intentional. The completed electoral documents were "errorally" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, said in a communication from the association. But actually the second captain Manuel Rosas. "We will take responsibility for the administrative error, but you would have voted as the official of the team.
The other cases are now examined by FIFA in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world footballer election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine Affair: High-ranking Republicans Call for Official Investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have spoken out openly for an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said Vermont state Republican governor Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being determined." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump observed Biden "for years."
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair, but few have expressed discomfort. Scott’s comments are now a first indication of this in Trump’s party, with the moderate governor of Virginia already turning against Trump’s policies several times, such as the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, called for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course of action and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, formally do not have a say in the trial against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, the Republicans' first senators have also commented critically on the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second parliamentary chamber, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing to the U.
The affair could result in the initiation of impeachment proceedings against Trump, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into it, accusing him of abuse of power for foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no exact timetable for the impeachment process. With a majority in the House, the Democrats could make an effort to impeach. However, the decision to actually impeach the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority, is therefore low. So far, no U.S. president has been deprived of an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Sicily and allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June, after she had unauthorized with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees aboard the port of Lampedusa. After violent protests and international criticism - including by Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted again after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious charges are being made against rockets. Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We can't rule out this information," the news reporters said.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24) "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - by repeated and constant notification of physical violence," it said at the time.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is investigated."
Italy’s right-wing former interior minister, Matteo Salvini, demanded an immediate apology from racket, which is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk sets Tesla delivery record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
“We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
Demand is strong, so Tesla could make 110,000 orders, Musk’s newsletter continued. The challenge is to get the cars to the customer quickly. To do this, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible at the quarter end.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with an increase of over six percent. The price has not been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered more than 95,000 cars, reaching its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This will require six-digit figures in the current and next quarters. The cheapest Tesla Model 3 in particular is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
US budget dispute: Once again only bridge financing
The new fiscal year will start in the U.S. on October 1st without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, the United States has no spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on transitional funding (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, Trump would have to shut down a decision on Monday at midnight.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the Federal Administration is now being financed at the level and in line with the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. For the time being, the Federal Administration therefore cannot benefit from the expanded spending framework for the new financial year from 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion dollars.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. But the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly capable of a majority.
The ghosts are separating on the issue of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans apparently are trying to force $12 billion for the wall construction, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are bothering the wall construction plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the wall construction had already led to a 35-day shutdown in December 2018.
On the wall, the ghosts separate
It is currently unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. It is more likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks to extend the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the backdrop of the congress’ ongoing inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Submission p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the funding of the federal administration at the level of the previous year, stopping the travel activity of parliamentarians and withholding their wages until the new annual spending plans.
France Allows Artificial Insemination for Lesbians and Singles
In France, artificial insemination should also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a bill by the government, according to which all women can use an in vitro insemination, which is expected to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future numerous "children without a father" could grow up. Also the French bishops' conference is against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core of a bioethics law, which Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as an "opportunity" for society. It represents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the cost of artificial insemination for all women is to be borne by social security.
Sperm Insemination of Dead Husband Continues to Be Banned
On the other hand, the National Assembly with a bare majority rejected an amendment that would give widows access to the sperm of their dead husbands for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem". In the past, there were cases in Germany in which women in vain complained about the release of the sperm of a deceased man.
Many members of the ruling party La République en Marche (LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition opposed artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be "doubled in grief" if her husband's death also left her desire to have children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot have children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for singles or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: Calls for airfare for universities are getting louder
A lot is flown at the universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate tax there in the future. The rectors say that they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion on a climate levy on flights from universities and colleges postponed before the summer break comes back into play. After the Conference of State Rectors had sceptically responded to a corresponding advance from the Green-Black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical college argued that it was necessary to take a step forward.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB, the arrested illegally fished in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a gun change between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. But this time there were no injuries, it was said.
Communist North Korea suffers from a chronic food shortage. North Korean fishermen were on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard says they are patrolling their marine biological resources.
30,000 squid confiscated
During the re-checks, 30,000 squid were discovered and confiscated on the boats, and three fishing boats and two motorboats were confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s fishing authority had not issued fishing licenses to the North Koreans even after complaints by local entrepreneurs this year, and according to media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there at times this year.
The head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, also recently lamented high ecological damage from North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow mesh synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. With these, small creatures would also be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need to be destroyed, destroyed.
In the future, only 18,000: U.S. cuts asylum ceiling
The “most generous nation in history”: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officers in the White House.
The richest country on earth is cushioning itself against those seeking protection: As the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal entry of refugees will be lowered further.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees again. In the financial year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department explained. In the already almost expired financial year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
In recent years, President Donald Trump’s administration has drastically reduced the readiness to welcome those seeking protection from around the world, and under Barack Obama’s predecessor, there were far higher reception limits.
The target limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980, yet the State Department described the U.S. as “the most pitiful and generous nation in history,” a phrase that strongly echoes the current U.S. president’s use of language.
A "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump said. He is receiving a lot of support from supporters for his hard course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to shut off. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially imminent impeachment process.
The U.S. government wants to focus in the future on the reception of two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are endangered, as the State Department said, while a maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be received from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Against this background, the United States has only signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan woman has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a shelter for apes in the USA at the request of the Argentine judiciary. The "Sandra", born in Rostock Zoo in 1986, was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release was mandatory. The animal was taken to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight - but not as a passenger, but as a lawyer in the cargo room.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wild, she is expected to live in the open space of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly a pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, "Sandra" has to stand in the state of Quarantine for about 40 days.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before moving to Buenos Aires in 1995. The "Sandras" fundamental rights process, initiated in 2014 by animal rights activists, has helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park, where a research and education facility for the preservation of biodiversity is to be built by 2023.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has achieved a new husar ride at the almost 3000 meter high Great Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Zinn in a new record time.
Clothed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent, thus undercutting the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in free solo speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the U.S. sports goods manufacturer Nike posted a significant profit increase. Net profit in the past quarter rose to $1.4 billion (nearly €1.3 billion). That is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The reason for this is above all the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", which the Adidas competitor turns directly to its customers online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period to the end of August, the strongest increase in Nike sales figures in China by 22 percent. As a result, the Beaverton Group in the US state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to targeting consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People’s Republic.
Andy Campion, chief financial officer, announced that Nike will continue to drive the “digital transformation” of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments, thus expanding its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer rose by more than five percent.
Lifelong ban on stadiums due to racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The Brazilian-born defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and urged his club to take action. "-officialasroma You should be proud of what you are doing with such a fan since 2016.
The club responded late Thursday. He reported the fan’s account to Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporter can never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly scandalize black players from rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sports. The situation in Italy has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," FIFA President Gianni Infantino said last weekend.
However, there have also been recent discussions about the fans of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now taken 38 rioting fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. For the rest, bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of, among other things, severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with a notice last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders are said to be behind the black trade with tickets, have "militarily controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole years are marked with gripping names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective way of life of young people?
"The Crabs Are Coming!" This call officially kicked off on September 21st at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun, which also kicked off the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "slow city" in China and is also home to the Chinese seat of the international "slow city" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields.
The people of Gaochun have already started crab farming in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has become a formative industry that provided high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively endeavoured to promote large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as a technology-supported crab farming.
In recent years, Gaochun has pushed ahead with a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and government services" and has meticulously built the service network for "licenses under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending" to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local advantages provided by the connection to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a flagship area. Gaochun has developed the "national" and "environmental" areas.
Iran-U.S. conflict: Ruhani talks about end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States had promised an end to all sanctions, Rouhani said on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: “Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no.”
Ruhani describes the situation as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting be held. “And America says I am lifting the sanctions,” added Ruhani. The kind of penalties that should be ended have been debated. “And they clearly said we are lifting all sanctions.”
However, this move was not done in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticized. Given the current penalties and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York, the background of which was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which is supposed to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. Like Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron had expressed hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After Western Turkey has been shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and sparked panic in the million-dollar metropolis. Now, the government wants to use a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential houses collapse - among other things, mustered by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which have been registered as refuges in the center, have long since been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August had the Chamber of Civil Engineers of Istanbul warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul are not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday’s quake was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the Silivri district and at a depth of about seven kilometers, according to the civil protection agency Afad. A smaller aftershock caused even more panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for security reasons. Some students cried as shown in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the quake in 1999 near Istanbul, when more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. The earthquake on Thursday hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies are designing emergency plans, private people have packed so-called go-bags with everything they need ready next door, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people were injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to this, two minarets of mosques in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer collapsed.
Warning about aftershocks in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings were shaking. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter about aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the quake is stated to be 13.59 (local time) and only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a aftershock, which was indicated with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt up to Istanbul. Also its epicenter had been located in the Marmara Sea west of the metropolis, the civil protection agency Afad said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that at some point it will discharge - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. It would have become more likely, he told CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a major earthquake," Ersoy told the station. "Sooner or later the big quake will come as well."
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also caused great concerns in Istanbul. In addition, only a few days ago there had been a violent earthquake in Albania - there were 68 people injured. Also on Lake Constance this year the earth had trembled.
Parliament: New Ignition in Ukraine Affair
Two explosive documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the US Democrats find themselves strengthened: The complaint about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president is a major victim of an investigation against the president.
USA: United Airlines passenger detained in toilet - Airplane redirected
Because a passenger was locked up in the board toilet, a flight was redirected by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline said, according to the US media.
During an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the tight cabin. About an hour she had been locked up in it, wrote US media citing other passengers. For the next flight to San Francisco, passengers had to change the plane.
A video posted on the Internet, reportedly from Flight 1554, shows several people trying to free the woman. "We're working to open the door right now, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man. The airline has apologized to all passengers. At first, it was clear whether the woman was receiving compensation.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous narrative “The Transformation,” British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) said. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to turn the will of the people into a wild one.
McEwan was quoted as saying: “If parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders, if Brexiteers in high positions are about to implore the disaster of a no-deal – then a writer has to wonder what he can do. There is only one answer to it: “write” about the intelligence.
Kafka’s first story, published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself “turned into a monstrous beast,” gradually excluded by family and society, and eventually perishes. “Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that is headed,” said Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austria’s rail infrastructure
11.200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce the noise pollution from freight trains, and sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips until October 31, 2019. Travel could "not be started for insolvency reasons," the company said on Thursday evening.
This includes bookings by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid for or fully paid for. As for travel with start date as of 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the grip of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
The insurer wants to send hotels money again.
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently host Thomas Cook vacationers, will receive money from the Zurich insurance company. Payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer required to make extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels are not immediately required to pay individual hotel bills or otherwise," said spokesperson Bernd Engelien.
The insurance responded to reports from hotel guests, who had been forced to pay their accommodation on site themselves. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected, will be voted on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance spokesman. According to information from Thursday, 70 000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were on the road. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return of the Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the announced payouts to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are still on the road. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly on holiday, it looks bad. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips would be cancelled until 31 October. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid for.
As for trips starting on November 1, 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance company, the further procedure will be examined, it said. In principle, the insurance company Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurance company Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys mine in Angola
Prince Harry has long continued the engagement of Lady Diana. In Africa, he now walks directly in the footsteps of his mother.
With a blue splinter-protected vest, British Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he made the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savanna landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 min fields.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go the way she went back then. The pictures on which Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which has begun in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stepping Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a clear commitment: with him, there is no guarantee of a third postponement of Brexit negotiations. But what statements are bilaterally excluded from the polarizing British for ever. The recent Supreme Court ruling in the UK hovers like a Damocles sword over the blonde boss. His suspension of parliament to be able to cancel his Brexit course until the beginning of the 31st October, Johnson had been forced to do so again.
Boris Johnson thinks the deal is still possible
However, the pressure doesn’t seem to go by Johnson either. Meanwhile, while visiting a hospital, he made indications that he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October in the event of a disagreement:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And the time is running out for Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators have about six weeks left to somehow prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But even the recent talks have not made a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems currently rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, there is no fear in the case of a new postponement of the exit date as Johnson.
U.S. authorities: further deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has increased to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, according to the U.S. Health Agency CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 people affected, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still unknown in Europe.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
The video of Mohammed Ali has been shared millions of times on online networks. The Spanish-based contractor and actor calls for a "people's revolution". For this Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes to see mass rallies with a million participants in central places of the country.
At least the security authorities are alarmed. There was already an increased police presence in the center of Cairo. Several subway stations were closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians in part for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. Such an open protest had not been held in Egypt for years. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - just because they "invoked at the wrong time in the wrong place."
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he overthrew the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox from Greenland Expedition back
Polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday, when he arrived in the port of Hamburg, he was greeted by the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the racing yacht "Malizia" had brought over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has been investigating and documenting the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, the polar researcher said. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often done with the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of global warming and the debris of the seas. In the expedition, among other things, Greenland glacier ice was measured with a drone and fished with nets for microplastics, it said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans" the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid for noodles 430 euros
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the castle of Engelsburg in Rome: that seemed two Japanese tourists too much. The bill with 80 euros tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
“Such cases are damaging to the reputation of Rome, and we call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud,” a spokesman for Federagit, the travel guides’ association in Rome, according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messaggero (Friday’s edition).
The reaction was prompted by the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. This is not to be seen from the invoice. A tip of up to 20 percent of the invoice is normal, the host said.
U.S. President Donald Trump, after the turbulent revelations of recent days, could actually face impeachment proceedings, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - we are talking about weeks until a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the whistleblower, who has finally taken the conversation out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the US with his complaint to the public, is monstrous: the president has abused the power of his office to force the government of another country to become so instrumental in in in influencing the elections 2020.
The core of this project can also be traced in the now published caption of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reproduce the full text, but the phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, centered on Trump, especially his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public’s point of view, the story begins in May 2019, when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani reports his travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected President Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are sensitive. "We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation, "but this is not a useful basis for my investigation," he says.
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that are fixated on Trump’s counter-candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia’s investigations in the US, but this accusation was never serious.
This is exactly the investigation that Trump will talk so prominently about on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giuliani and the president is: the former vice president and currently promising candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has acted as Ukraine representative of the Obama administration on the dismissal of the then Ukrainian attorney general.
When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General leave, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt gestures, the U.S. government was by far not the only Western partner to push for his dismissal. By the way, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation.
Disturbances on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media is down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, the UK and Spain are mainly affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not loaded since about 3:30 pm. Instagram also gives the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disruption, although so far not to the same extent.
Instagram and co. more often affected by disturbances
It’s not the first massive incident this year. As early as March and July, services had been down for several hours. And as in the previous cases, this time, users also resort to Twitter primarily to air their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on an inflatable boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the misfortune - less than an hour took the Chilean rescue helicopter to recover.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the news, at just before ten we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were above the inflatable boat."
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NIE wireless charging
Practical but harmful
Although inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, it should not be used.
Since several new smartphones that support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models - have just recently been launched, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. This is due to the significantly greater heat consumption. If you charge a mobile phone normally via cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. With wireless charging, the researchers even with the smartphone perfectly aligned on the charging pad, on the other hand, always measured the power consumption higher than 30 degrees.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor. Every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also does not last for as long as it lasts. So the lifespan is smaller. The researchers therefore recommend always charging the smartphone via cable. Since a battery exchange is always associated with high costs for modern smartphones, this is probably a helpful tip for Apple.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and tedious plug fumble. Since Qi (stands for inductive power transmission) is a worldwide standard, which should be used in exceptional cases even Apple, there are hardly any limitations.
Everest-Stau Photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, said his expedition organizer.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international headlines: From him comes a viral photo of mountaineers standing in line on Mount Everest in the spring.
The image of the mass crowd sparked a debate about stronger security measures on the 8,848-metre-high mountain and highest peak on Earth. In May, eleven climbers had died at the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Chinese authorities are currently locking up the Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is bad weather, among other things. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to allow it to ascend.
Four Dead Elephants Discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous Sigiriya rock fort visited by many tourists. According to the police spokesman, the animals were presumably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed each year by elephants. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
Sri Lanka is estimated to be home to only about 7,000 elephants, whose death is theoretically punishable by the death penalty.
British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its detention by Iran, announced the maritime agency Bandar Abbas, according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had determined the British-flagged tanker on July 19 on charges of disregarding maritime law regulations in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in Criticism
The responsible economic committee of the House of Commons wants to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook in a comprehensive way. It should be about the salary packages of the Executive Board as well as the question why the British government would not want to financially contribute to the company struggling for survival. "Our interest is in oversight at the company as well as the control by external auditors," said the committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London.
According to experts, genes are overestimated in colon cancer risk
The role of the genes in the family's increased risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study conclude that other risk factors, such as family dietary habits, are likely to weigh more than previously assumed. This has had consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colon cancer, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk raises Tesla shares
This Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published Thursday (local time) from the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to get the cars to the customer quickly, for which Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible at the quarter-end.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with an increase of over six percent. The price has not been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars, thus reaching its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be produced in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Will the British government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson cautious
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is looking for ways to circumvent the law recently passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit, and on a question he said Friday to journalists that his government will abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law", which makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exits.
Johnson said he is aiming for a treaty with the European Union: “We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is to have an agreement.”
Iran to increase uranium enrichment
“Unfortunately, the European states are showing inability or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions,” Rouhani said at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, in return, contained the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US stepped out of the agreement on its own in 2018, with "maximum pressure" to force Iran to change course in the perceived aggressive Middle East policy.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or at least prepared for uranium centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to bear their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rohani suspected, but there will still be further talks that will hopefully bring a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran’s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the mixed situation changed: Germany, France and Britain followed the U.S. assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen had confessed to the attack, but what was considered by the U.S. to be a false confession.
“Those who make such accusations must present evidence,” said Rohani, but European leaders would not have been able to do so during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would only have relied on the fact that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration would first have to be lifted, Rouhani demanded, calling on the Washington government to shift to a policy of “dialogue and reason.”
Comet of another star intersects solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This was achieved first. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a presumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named after its discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The long-travelled comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Re-observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not originate from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017 only the second interstellar object that was seen during a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close-up insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears at never-before-see. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet resembles that of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. "The current velocity of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, the Naoc's typical of this distance.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was first discovered under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was the name of the
The astronomers are lucky: unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted approaching. Thus, the researchers have many months left for investigations. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in a first study the diameter of the sky object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Photographs of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a distinct tail of the comet.
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León.
The IAU estimates that the discovery of two interstellar visitors in just two years indicates that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems, but it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such spot visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission by the European space agency Esa.
The agency wants to station the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" (comet interceptor) in a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth by 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it should either lurk on a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/Ou'Oum.
First landing at Beijing’s new mega-airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China, the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital has landed a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines, a special honour for the captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers will be handled annually at the new airport, and by 2025 it will be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “sea star” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, later to be expanded to seven and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
The Chinese had already announced several times during the construction that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and much smaller - has so far been postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger plane landed after only four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams of that. To make this, for the 2030s targeted flight very advanced a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) that the company develops Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the agency said. "That's the technology that could make it happen."
To advance the project, the British space agency wants to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date, the Concorde from 1976 to 2003 had covered the New York-Paris route and took three to three and a half hours. In the year 2000 there was also an accident with the launch of a Concorde at the Paris airport.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," says Reaction Engines on his homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that is five times faster than the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the atmosphere and thus enable the "next generation of truly reusable devices".
Uprising in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power of the US president, Donald Trump wants to find possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the whistleblower," Trump told U.S. embassy staff in New York on Thursday. The person involved was almost "a spy" and had been "a bit different" in the past.
This was seen as an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was actually not public. However, several U.S. media broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted outraged at the president’s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday announced preparations for impeachment proceedings against Trump. Their allegations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who raises serious allegations against Trump and his government headquarters. Under heavy public pressure, the whistleblower’s descriptions were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower has received information from several government employees that the U.S. president “uses the power of his office” to get another country to interfere in his favor in the 2020 U.S. election.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, dealing with Biden’s son Hunter’s past business in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian presidential election in 2020.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukraine telephony. Leading government employees had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been made. This was after the conversation at the instruction of lawyers from the White House but was only published from a database intended for this purpose.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was an employee of the foreign intelligence agency CIA.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had spread second-hand information that would have turned out to be inaccurate. Therefore, there may be no tippers or spies at all.
As Trump said in New York about those who allegedly gave information to the whistleblower, it sparked outrage. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted disturbedly and lamented that Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations against Trump and his environment have been underway for months in various committees. In light of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now advancing investigations with new force in order to initiate a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
"The whistleblower gave us a timetable for our investigation," House Intelligence Committee chief Adam Schiff said. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of misrepresenting the matter, and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insulted Ship and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy sectors, who were mostly active under democratic but also under Republican presidents, backed the Democrats’ investigation for a possible impeachment process in a statement released Friday. If the allegations are true, it would be “a ruthless abuse of power” by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further process. With a majority in the House, the Democrats could pursue what is known as an impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The chances of such a procedure being successful are therefore small. So far, no US president has been enthoed by an impeachment procedure of the office.
VW Works Council: Jobs are being ‘slowly’ dismantled
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the automaker’s works council over. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros from ten billion euros by 2023, of which 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
One key to this is the personnel costs. The "Future Pact" negotiated in 2016 between the company and the works council already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be dismantled at the automaker if it is proven that the related activities are no longer necessary.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production that are not actually available are "seekly" dismantled via another route - i.e. past the official course.
In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing the re-occupation. Meanwhile, in many places there is a lack of personnel, the work compaction is increasing, the concerns about a gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants would be greater. Thus, the fear that vehicle production could gradually be deducted from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world.
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and centrally control new projects. This is also to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a managerial conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make a firm stand on the crisis".
For example, this year, production costs per vehicle would fall for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on the production time do not mention VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is around
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb applies within VW that 800,000 cars must be built there every year to make the plant satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the decreasing demand for diesel fuel.
As Tostmann announced last year, in Wolfsburg, however, "perspectively" a million cars are to roll off the band. This is to make the bundling of the Golf production at the main plant possible - because the plant in Zwickau gives the golf production by the conversion to the site for the electric car production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Golf 8.
Forced to prostitution with voodoo: human traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, slaughtered into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected human traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the expatriate Nigerian women still had to take a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest at home.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought into inflatable boats across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to pay the alleged smuggler costs of an average of 25,000 euros. The wage was therefore completely taken from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the entry and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the trial. "The work made it physically and psychologically difficult for the women," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were rightly disgusted."
The verdicts are on commercial and gang-like introductions of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and heavy forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In a continuous dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant union Ufo has once again threatened with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "on October 14th inform the LH Group about the labour struggle measures", said Ufo tariff board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been refusing to hold collective bargaining negotiations with Ufo for months, including the question of whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo is now strengthened following a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to state that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examines to appeal against it. "I think it is unlikely that a second court will see the matter completely differently," said Ufo board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Regional Labour Court in Frankfurt to have the UFO's status as a union reviewed in court. The company argues that the union had not set up a representative board for months and was thus unable to fulfill its role as a collective bargaining partner.
There was a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, in the course of which numerous members of the Executive Board and the Advisory Board resigned, including long-time union chief Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had suspended a preliminary vote on strikes by cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about its leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia wasn’t exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but that is supposed to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract international tourists in the future.By 2030, they want to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
“The opening up of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually only given for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the archconservative Kingdom hopes to receive more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
By mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churai oil field. As a result, national oil production fell drastically, oil prices surged, and it is likely to take several weeks for the Kingdom’s oil production to return to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are stuck in preparations for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos on their Instagram stories on Thursday (local time) on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my smoking for the wedding," according to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry church next weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers gave themselves the yes in a New York civil society office, and there hadn't been a bigger party at the time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: “If you don’t want to compromise, you can’t have a relationship.”
Two killed in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metzhin), the police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been searching for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use during the search. The cause of the accident still has to be determined. The crash site is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are at risk of extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are the causes of the threat, the IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 trees known in Europe. 265 of them are found on no other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", and "extinct in nature" to "extinct". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species as endangered worldwide.
Wild and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) is especially threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild Ordinary Horse chestnuts. They have been considered "endangered" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The largest threat, alongside a mushroom, is the Balkan miniature moth. It has been spreading from Southeastern Europe throughout the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnut trees to be less than hipcastic.
Shrub species and mosses also at risk
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for mollusks, shrubs and mosses. More than one-fifth of mollusks and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, imported species, agricultural practices and climate change. Mollusks and birds played a key role in recycling.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europe Office.
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 injured
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured, but dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, Turkish vice president Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged, with nearly 200 aftershocks since the earthquake the previous day. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and sparked panic in the million-dollar metropolis.
Now, the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the heaviest quakes was one of the 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
On Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 quake shook the region around Istanbul, calling on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in halftime show
Latin-pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football finale Super Bowl. The singers announced on Twitter. "It won't be any bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is insanely excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. So far it will be in Miami on February 2, 2020.
Jennifer Lopez said she had been dreaming of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at the time she saw Diana Ross flying to the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina," she couldn't wait "to show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world."
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she is honored to be with another artist on one of the largest stages in the world and represent Latinos and Latinas from the US and around the world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it is the first time the two "queens" are together on a stage.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling audiences
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though your viewership has dropped recently, this February the spectacle in the United States attracted the fewest viewers in more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
In the run-up to the half-time show of last Super Bowl, there had been turmoil: last February, according to media reports, the quarrel over dealing with quarterback Colin Kaepernick did not want to perform top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had fallen to his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL games in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African-American football club.
Cook plea: hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to suffer from the bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook. High depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans threatens. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse would probably have to write a total of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, according to estimates from the consulting firm AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept depreciation of  pounds 900 million to 1 billion and the lenders would have to accept between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually to be depreciated are likely to be at the top of the bandwidths, an expert told the paper.
After the insolvency proceedings have ended, it will be clear how much creditors will actually lose. A person close to this procedure did not give too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 Thomas Cook aircraft in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in poor conditions. Most of the money you could probably get out of selling the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, it said.
Rackete reportedly brought suspected killers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who allegedly tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we don't have any backed-up information about it," said spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the dpa news agency.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, tortured and killing people in Libya. The suspected perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neubau emphasized that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29, ramming a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects also arrived there. The captain is under investigation for aid to illegal immigration.
United States warns federal government of Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great,” Pai told the “Handelsblatt” with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that requires every company “under Chinese jurisdiction” to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties of such requests," the FCC chief continued, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the German government has agreed to demand a “confidential declaration” from suppliers.
Berlin would first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the Handelsblatt, citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology not only consists of the hardware:
It is precisely the software that is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It would be "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership relationships are opaque. The employee company, which is supposedly owned by the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic firewall illuminates the sky above a North French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and nurseries in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday as a precautionary measure, the prefecture said. The Ministry of the Interior had asked citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to be exposed to smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals inside, protect their food and stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire was completely erased on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that smell will spread after the deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and gendarmes were deployed at the fire site.
A giant black smoke column had previously ascended from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol plant, which produces additives for oils. The production facility is located a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy, according to authorities, belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored.
Prefect of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told BFMTV news channel that there was no "high toxicity" in samples at first, but pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. Dams against pollution were built in the river, the prefecture said.
The fire erupted around 2:40 in the early morning, the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: 'Germany must invest now'
French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany needs to invest and now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions.”
Those states that have budgetary leeway for more investment would need to act, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, pointing to its country’s high national debt, which is more than 98 percent of its gross domestic product. The French national debt must be “stabilized” and “lowered”, Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments to revive the European economy, and German politicians have repeatedly called on France to manage its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, which was presented on Thursday, envisages tax reliefs of more than €9 billion for households.
The French government is responding to the protests of the yellow vest movement, among other things. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to the expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question on Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes Parliament's "capitulation law".
Parliament is back, a law dictates the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson might still use a loophole. Addressing this possibility, however, the Tory politician deviates.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering up on whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit – despite the law recently passed by parliament, which is exactly to prevent that.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law", which makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the law's entry into force until after the EU exits. Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is with
Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said he sees the political disputes over Brexit as a “walk in the park” and was confident that the desired EU exit would still come about: “We enjoy it, we will win, we will leave the EU, no worries,” Cummings told the British newspaper “Tele”.
Cummings, who led the “Vote Leave” Brexit campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now serving as chief strategist in the British government headquarters at Downing Street, and is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into a seemingly hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the big rock photographers, but it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the picture book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, among which were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders front woman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from pre-Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney’s legacy as a committed artist and the instant magic of polaroid film.”
With Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids she made, several hundred of them are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
These are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always the focus: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
Then he dances on his shoulders with his daughter Mary, calls in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but she was also living a normal life beyond the spotlight on her farm in southern England or in Scotland. So Mary McCartney told the BBC that she had always been sleeping in a bedding carrot.
Like no other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's about the deciding click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift to capture the right moment at all times. "She just knew she had it," Paul said in the Eshun-E.
This is where the light, the composition, the picture section and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only a fun picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great anecdotal pleasure, where landscapes also look like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road" was released exactly 50 years ago.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.”
Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from its neighbour, despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,” Erdogan said in New York, where he participated in the UN General Assembly.
But Erdogan admitted that Turkey has problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies have withdrawn “because of US threats.”
“Turkey will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this and many other issues,” said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since leaving the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran secretly pursues a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have intensified significantly in recent months.
U.S. Government to Restrict Refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically reduce the reception of refugees. The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which is a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said the U.S. would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the main task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are endangered, according to the State Department statement, while a maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be received from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The program, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program’s history. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was almost 85,000.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, “and the US would continue to harm its leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.”
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the U.S. - legal and illegal. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year. These numbers are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump: “Comes close to a spike”
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever has given such clues to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power, "comes close to a sniper," Trump said, according to a record of a private event in New York on Thursday.
When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, Trump replied, “This is close to a spies.” Then Trump added, “Do you know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and treason, we used to do this a little different than we did now.”
Observers evaluated the latter remark as a possible allusion to the death penalty. Democrats sharply criticized Trump’s remarks and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment proceeding against him, the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committees, intelligence services and oversight wrote in the House of Representatives.
The whistleblower accuses the president of abusing his office in order to ask another country to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election, including his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump suggested that he inquire into his potential democratic rival, Mr. Joe.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower and his informant are, but according to the New York Times, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst from the CIA.
Refugee boat convicted: baby and toddlers drown in Aegean Sea
Time and again, people are trying to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea, with the often too small boats regularly censoring. Seven migrants have now died in the sinking of an inflatable boat - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the sinking of a rubber boat. Among the deaths were one baby and four other children, the Greek coastguard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small archipelago Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known from which countries the migrants come. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in far too small boats. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people died on this route last year.
The Who cancels concert
A U.S. concert by the rock band The Who has come to a horrible end due to the inconvenience of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. On the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it while it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized, adding that Daltrey "can't really talk now". Townsend promised the audience to come to his expense at a reparation concert, but an appointment is not yet set.
The Who, scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, said they would be picked up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear billions of dollars in revenue.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. The company had recently dismissed founder Adam Neumann as chief, postponed the planned IPO, and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for executives to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and leases it to members in the short term in small units. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire divisions of large corporations. So far, WeWork burns money at a breathtaking speed with this business. Last year, the company incurred a loss of $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion. This year alone, the cost of renting is expected to rise to 2.5 billions.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into leases of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months, almost 300,000 square meters of office space. Only WeWork's new contracts ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the areas that were newly launched at that time. Without WeWork's expansion, the office space would have risen in time.
The balance in the real estate market could also be noticeably shifted in the UK capital without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis, purchased last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have rebuilt their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the expected billions in revenue. Access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork they do not have despite the long-term leases. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork Special is usually done by means of specially established companies.
Russia once again arrested many North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen, a total of 262 poachers who had illegally fished in the waters have been arrested in recent days, the Russian domestic intelligence agency FSB said on Friday, according to the agency Interfax.
Only ten days ago, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard said they were carrying patrols to protect their marine biological resources. During the re-checks, 30,000 squid were discovered. In addition, three fishing boats and two motorboats were confiscated and a total of 8,000 were sent to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok in 2018.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there for a while, according to media in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, also recently lamented high ecological damage from the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow mesh synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. With these, even small living creatures would be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would not even need the technical ships to be destroyed.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the arrests last week. A North Korean, who was also wounded, later died from his injuries. On that 17th September, Russian border guards first fixed a North Korean boat and then a second, after the fire had opened.
U.S. Bans Ex-President Castro on Entry
The U.S. has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raul Castro and his children. The U.S. State Department justified this in a statement Thursday with Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he is head of a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also responsible for supporting Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, for human rights violations. “The disregard for human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela,” Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued a ban on entry, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. Venezuela has been raging for months in a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a number of sanctions on Maduro’s government to bring him to his knees and help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro’s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, today again thousands of people want to go on the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide. The beginnings are likely to be due to the shift in time in New Zealand and Australia, before the protests move across Europe to North America. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to attend a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how large the global audience will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, over four million people strike for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6,383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
The influx was particularly high in Germany last Friday. A good third of all global demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests, according to estimates by Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolitan areas such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities like Jüchen in North Westphalia.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to urge the politicians of her country to step up their commitment to climate protection. This led to the creation of the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short period of time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against global warming and the looming climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be curbed to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just under a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high-sea racing yacht. There she had last participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN in which she was urging the heads of state and government of the earth to speak up strongly to her right. In her hometown of Stockholm, her alternative was to the right.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This foresees a change in fire safety. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency said Thursday in Moscow, according to the agency Tass. The ban is expected to come into force on October 1.
Those who still smoke, therefore, have to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should start a fire, then the penalty is higher. Under the ban, according to the ministry, also burning candles. Also meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed to grill.
Attack on cybercriminals - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against crime on the internet, German investigators have for the first time extracted a large server provider for illegal transactions on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites via which internationally active criminals conducted their activities as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle.
The Prosecutor General’s Office in Koblenz announced this. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a large action. The darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
One of the suspects’ customers is said to have been the operators of the world’s second-largest darknet drug marketplace, “Wall Street Market”, which investigators had smashed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyberbunker, according to the Attorney General’s Office.
Such a hoster was first excavated in Germany, it said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access action with the support of special forces such as the GSG9, searches took place in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, today again thousands of people want to go on the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Who are Thunberg’s behindmen?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more surprising is the fact that a 16-year-old girl holds the mirror of the power man of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and leads young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world. It is not the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to win an accumulation of children and young people. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt he had chosen to fight for a more just world. At that time, this young man could also win over the sailboat.
But is there a shadow side in this regard? Why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold extensively, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Even well-established followers of Greta Thunberg were not too upset with the last one.
This is where the spirits are divided: Is it morally right to be financially enriched in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles of people work together with stockbrokers during the world bailout? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Our Solar System
A strange comet is currently traversing our solar system.
The assumptions of astronomers have been confirmed: A foreign comet is crossing our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently traversing our solar system. It was baptized after its explorer 2I/Borisov and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet Discovered by Amateur Astronomers in Crimea
This body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked to the sky with a home-built telescope and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be seen during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get a close look at a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to that of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic trajectory that takes it out of our system.
Comet has been spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it comes, astronomers can observe it in detail, because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in its approach, which means it can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. Space Agency.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comet - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Lacandrovia.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Just recently, a giant asteroid rushed past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
‘Absolutely reprehensible’: Rachel Johnson appalled at brother
Boris Johnson is getting more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges the prime minister's bellicose language with clear words as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "scam", contract: Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly upgrading - at least verbally. At the questionnaire in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this encountered massive outrage from the opposition, and now other critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be “hanged, stretched, quadrupled, tarred and sprung up”. She thinks this is extremely reprehensible. She doesn’t recognize her brother’s version, Rachel Johnson said, who was “hanging” in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Bart party.
Particularly, she came across her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly lower house member who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 exit referendum.
Cox’s widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. “It makes me sick when Jo’s name is used in this way,” he tweeted. The best way to honor it is if you are passionate and determined to stand up for what you believe in – no matter what your view is. But you should never “demonize the other side”. He also lamented that an atmosphere had emerged in the attacks.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson’s younger brother Jo had resigned from office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. “I’ve been torn between family loyalty and national interest in recent months – it’s an indissoluble tension,” Jo Johnson justified the move.
Johnson’s language was also strongly criticized in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that “is not worthy of this country.” In a joint statement, they stated: “In recent days, language has been unacceptable, both in debates and outside parliament. We should speak with respect to each other.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at Super Bowl
The NFL is setting a strong signal in the year of its 100th anniversary: in the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots, who promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming final of the U.S. Football League NFL, the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
“I am incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, which has incredible strength in the US,” Shakira said in a video.
The finale of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that this time the Super Bowl will put two women on stage - and two Latinas," Lopez said. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later also published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and from November in the drama "Hustlers" in the German cinemas.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer, making her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of half-time visitors is expected every time in the US. This year, many consider the selection also a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, the NFL final watches well over 100 million television viewers, it is now extremely popular in Germany as well.
Last year there were political controversies in advance. The reason was the quarrel over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had ultimately refused to rise in protest against police violence against blacks and had been harshly attacked by US President Donald Trump, among others. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had criticized a super Bowl appearance by many.
An actor and Youtuber is adding to Egypt’s ruler: for now, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men, who have influence over whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt, have both spent the past week abroad. One of the two rushed back to Egypt on Friday to protest the Syrians at the airport. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state in the country, had deposed a pleasant time-
Misleading - according to the president, the other man is trying to determine what is going on on the streets. Of course, Mohamed Ali stayed abroad, where he escapes the access of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor to only a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice of the country's tea, the
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president revels in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he has been doing business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years as a second-time contractor, at least he seems to know exactly what he is talking about.
After last week for the first time since Sisi’s grip on power had protested thousands against his rule and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested. These protestors called for a “million march” this Friday. That really so many people would dare to take to the streets was unlikely. But there were some small protests from the local police.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters last week broke banners with the president's portrait, a massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the outskirts. In Cairo, several metro stations in the city were closed due to "maintenance work", most of the streets around the Tahrir Square were blocked, the heart revolution by 2011.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our target does not have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not bump into police officers."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.
Those who enter into an internet contract do not have to blindly trust the speed data of the providers. Customers can check themselves in case of abnormalities, how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the pre-promised transmission rates are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Center Bavaria.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. For example, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the providers are carried out in accordance with supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," the Consumer Center Bavaria said on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days in order to produce the promised service.
If this does not affect anything, even after repeated requests, customers can terminate and possibly also claim damages.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
“I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here will be determined by the facts that will be established,” Vermont Governor Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, for Trump watched Biden “for years.”
Republicans have so far held back from criticizing Trump for the whistleblower affair, and few have expressed discomfort. Scott’s comments are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump’s policies several times, such as the easing of environmental protection regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man Remains in MCU: Another Marvel Movie
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: it was announced at the end of August that Sony and Marvel will go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This is reported by several US media. According to this, the film is set to start in the USA from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel boss Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I am delighted that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. Me and everyone at the Marvel studios are extremely pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony will continue to work on his Spidey verse".
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel is said to have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also includes Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of incoming Spider-Man movies. However, the news is not confirmed.
How Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry show up in the "Suits" finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the big finale in the USA. In the last episode there were many happy endings and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked in the series for many years, was paid a charming tribute. Attention, the following sections included spoilers for the series finale.
Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a last goodbye as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess, such as the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his imprisonment.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) walks straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit.
Aegean Sea: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children have drowned while a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea crashed. A total of seven people died in the accident, according to the Greek Coast Guard on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants are currently transferring from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route last year. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wants to "inform himself about the refugee situation" in Turkey, said Seehofer on Friday, and then in Athens he wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in order to be able to help with the situation.
A spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday Seehofer’s planned trip with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants continue to arrive from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, according to the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increased numbers recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This means that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants illegally coming to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.
However, due to a shortage of staff, the processing of the asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, almost 29,400 people live in Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. Worst of all, the situation on Lesbos is that there are currently 5,200 migrants in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
There have never been so many since the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact came into force in March 2016, the state broadcaster reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will in the future put the health system to the test. The climate changes are "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system caused high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time and led to more people with heart attacks.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo pane
Canadian Greens chief Elizabeth May in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Greens chief holds a reusable mug in his hand in a photo, but now it came out: the mug was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has been quite a long time unnoticed - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee mug with metal straw was never in the hand of Elizabeth May, the chief of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website she was seen in a photo with this mug, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had been previously published and also distributed to the media.
Green leader has to answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and of the fact that the party produces fake news in order to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection", in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons, in which it is also increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked the discussion about fake news. One user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairman to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and claimed on her blog that she had not known about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, a cup in hand. However, the, she put it right, was from bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokeswoman of the party said that it was only a matter of looking at the party logo in the picture.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she told the Guardian, asking herself something from her over-engaged team: "If they want to edit a picture again, can't they do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also come to Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastics or because of air travel, but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Supposedly Jaqueline Ng was assured an upgrade by email from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Getting an upgrade to Business Class spontaneously - that's what many passengers dream of. Sometimes they're lucky, and the check-in staff offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: a self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the way out, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, despite showing a mail in which she allegedly planned to upgrade Cathay Pacific. The letter said the influencer had received it from a marketing employee of the airline, while the airline accused Jaqueline of faking the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman was reported to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they were choking at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from which the mail was allegedly coming was said to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaqueline’s ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban on Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight tick to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because while Cathay had reimbursed her the price of her original ticket, Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains closed for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that she does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices drop after Yemen ceasefire report
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in a short time on Friday afternoon. Recently, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea variety Brent cost $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
A Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen said Saudi Arabia agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities in mid-September had brought five percent of the world’s oil production to a halt. The Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had claimed the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tensions in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, one can focus on growth and demand concerns, Ole Hansen, head of the commodity strategy department at Saxo Bank, told Bloomberg news agency.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost almost $59, Brent nearly $65.
Bloomberg recently reported, citing insiders, that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia is progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September, according to which the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders who report rapid progress of the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work, but commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on the way to leave the port more than two months after being detained by Iran and the recently granted release. The crew is now preparing the departure while the ship is still anchored, shipowner Erik Honell told the Swedish broadcaster in a text message on Friday morning.
However, the U.S. announced that it would move defense missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia as Iran’s arch-enemy, with fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. at times driving oil prices up significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
In the affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, allegations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials have made intense efforts to prevent access to the text of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July.
North Korea considers Trump and Kim’s third summit to be questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit of Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be in the nuclear conflict, and the sense and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The U.S. has so far done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry adviser said. He also criticized tightened U.S. sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the U.S. and South Korea, but he hopes Trump will take a "wise" and "courageous" decision to bring it back to rapprochement.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June, both then met again in the demilitarized zone, but so far the successes between the two Korean states have been agreed.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers to help clear mines
With a blue splinter protection vest, British Prince Harry has symbolically detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he created the ignition circuit. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded. With the goal of getting Angola free of mine by 2025, he later called on the countries to commit to running TV cameras.
Pounds under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British Pound Under Pressure
In the face of an imminent interest rate cut, the pound is losing value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt’s speculation on an imminent interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) puts the pound sterling on the table. The British currency fell by up to 0.4 percent to $1.269 on Friday.
The sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who called for a cut in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, as Saunders is considered a champion of restrictive monetary policy, analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Traders Brokerhaus Activ said.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy due to the Brexit hack, without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU if necessary without a divorce agreement on October 31.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian Manipulations Proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the Athletics World Federation.
At the start of the World Athletics Championship, new details of the Russian doping scandal are revealed - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and only beginning of the year. In January 2019, the Moscow doping lab finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport was revealed. After that, the Wada had suspended the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, allowed about 270 athletes in the country to compete in the Russian sports, and at the Winter Games in February 2018 they were able to compete in the different sports.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the samples mentioned. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Athletics World Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been positively manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Warankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" from Friday.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the IAAF’s stance: The Athletics Association is the only organization to stick to Russia’s ban. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes are taking off under a neutral flag and had to prove that they are training outside of the Russian system and undergoing tests.
Earlier this week, the Wada had already put manipulations in the room and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the re-blocking of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
