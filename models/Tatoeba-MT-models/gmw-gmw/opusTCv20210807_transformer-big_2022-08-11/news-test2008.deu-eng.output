Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro area, the inflation rate was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg reported.
Official forecasts are only 3%, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the Leitzins. In its discretion, the interest rate cut would favour rising commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB strives to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the throes: inflation must be “correlated” in order to rule out the need for action later on.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a twelve-year record high in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the eurozone is due to rising food and energy prices.
MATIF wheat quotations rose 88 percent, and the price of soybeans has also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in the price of edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose 52 percent this year - last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9% in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3 percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
The Gallup Government Crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably until the beginning of December, with the party having the largest base camp for the first time since 2002, while approval for the socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
The difference among the party-loyal voters is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to one-fifth (20 percent) of approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry threshold: they come to two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the general economic mood has continued to deteriorate - never before has the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" been so high (41 percent), while a further 46 percent consider it "pretty bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families once again see the change in their financial situation as more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate further; only one-tenth expects an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents – a historic high – considered the Prime Minister’s work “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the proportion of proponents for Viktor Orbán accounts for 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the leader of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think that one could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without changing government.
After the riots last October, if 35% were still in favour of the government and the head of government, that share today is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent responded that they would “participate with certainty,” and another 20% would “probably” cast their vote.
By comparison, if parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the polls "with certainty" and another 15 percent would consider their participation "probable".
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily fee.
Relocated to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty", the proportion of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be 81, 84 and 89 percent, respectively.
Also, the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaer trading area have maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year again this year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets "gallopped" last December, the rate has not been drastic compared to the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it certainly has a dissuasive effect on consumers that what they paid for far below 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800, the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year’s level, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but for Auchan there were 1kg of waking bread for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop to less than 200 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two liter Coca-Cola pawn bottle of under 200 Forint, so the drink including pawn cost only 257 HUF.
Nonetheless, this year's "Napi" cart comparison was the most expensive for Auchan, and Cora was the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora’s prices in the “Napi” cart have increased by 15 percent compared to last year’s Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between last year’s cheapest shopping cart and today’s most expensive one was 12%, while the increase between last year’s cheapest shopping cart and the current year’s most expensive one was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was 1,206.00 forint, but the increase in VAT was noticeable in prices last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has affected the trade: Apparently, the department stores were not able to decide what price range to apply to the individual items, because the impact of the price increase on consumer behavior was unforeseeable.
(If the trader is poorly planning the orbital speed of a product, he may fall by substantial profits in the price range that depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price of the "Napi" cart was so radical last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1.630.00 forint more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest there was a price increase of 1.284.00 forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, with the price of daily consumables in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office noted an increase of more than 30% over the 12-month period.
So in addition to flour also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of the already expensive product has risen by barely more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to shift the drastic price increase to the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; good years are constantly reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices.
Large quantities are purchased from everything, durable food goes in pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning there were endless queues at the cash register in all three department stores when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country is reported to have a lower customer frequency, so many multis complain to the poll researchers that they cannot even reach the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
Today, more than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to curbing the infections, according to the senior doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of the János hospital, an MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection.
The injured person in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but a short time later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation could not be performed since then because of the bacteria that is still in the patient’s body.
By December 10, 1094 multi-resistant infections were reported from hospitals to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the lead doctor of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections triggered by multi-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about one-third of people in their nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, tonsil inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are dosed too high or used improperly, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are produced from the well-responsive bacteria, which spread rapidly in the hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Particularly in patients with weakened or permanently malfunctioning immune systems, but also in elderly or low-weight patients, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday life in the hospital.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
“Such patients are isolated, nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks during care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are being examined for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is too rare
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals would be preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for curbing the development or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and retirement homes, hospitals should examine the admitted patients and isolate MRSA-infected patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not so common in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no state health insurance grants for this investigation.
Most cases therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
Among outpatients, or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling is even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Saved on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by nursing staff.
This is precisely why hand washing or wearing gloves and masks is very important, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds lined up tightly, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, it unfortunately even happens in the financially less well-off hospitals that disinfectants are saved, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that almost favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting to grips with MRSA infections causes huge costs to health insurance companies, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government program.
After initial signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared preventing the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and preventing infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Police officer was not drunk.
In the case of the car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district with a fatal outcome, the official opinion is now available.
The now retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokeswoman of the Budapest Attorney General's Office on Friday, after the official opinion was presented on the case.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he sat on the wheel.
The former police chief bogged into Kossuth Lajos Street with his own car in the XXII district, driving over a 55-year-old man who crossed the street at an unmarked point.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebars have, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, subordination .)
The pedestrian was killed after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then retired and requested retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has launched its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
A further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements totalling EUR 400 million on Friday in Budapest.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement of EUR 100 million has been signed earlier.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be used for research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also mentioned.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be re-discussed.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferment of 8 years, free of charge.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe looks at the formerly rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the cheapest market in the EU, but which is becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most sought-after pavement for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the Renner, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also in increasing demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the interior will also attract investors, for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the very favourable area of Russians is showing more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers enticing offers - commercial and office spaces offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its best track to become one of the most attractive European golfer’s paradises, attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons as well as the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are already buying in a large-scale fashion, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are predominantly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle buy either revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or abandoned houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connections and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are important, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed in the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the aim of increasing value in the medium to long term.
Real estate in the capital, however, is constantly becoming more expensive, due to the ever-increasing demand.
In the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there has been an annual increase of 21 percent.
The price of real estate far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced that the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a fierce debate between developed and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are willing to support the developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on aid to developing countries was also reached.
The Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member council, expected to be held by the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as stated in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that by 2020, the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (measured by the 1990 levels), whether or not the "Agreement after 2012" will be achieved successfully, and the Union would even be willing to commit to a 30% reduction if other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to fulfil their commitments to the best of their ability and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its then 15 member states, had already committed itself to a decrease of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will certainly meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction plan set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, the importance of which has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the international Nobel Peace Prize-winning scientific climate change committee of the UN in its latest report.
This would delay emission reduction, and increasing the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, with extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British Army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube by itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The shots shot with miniature cameras mounted on helmets are controlled at the Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message unavoidable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such shots, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Commonwealth Office and the International Peace Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign deployments.
Such propaganda is almost free compared to traditional television advertising, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur shots, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored shots, also make it on the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films talk about the losses at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, numerous videos filmed in use have already been uploaded to the platform from the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British have only recently discovered this "genre" for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in the slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas party with tombola and pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means suffocating: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a work conference where her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure Christmas spirits with tombola or nudge the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - that's how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held this year in the defense department, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport beat the strings.
The 4.32 million Forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economics is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the festivities is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a tombola draw.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The room rent was 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party, which is hosted by the Hungarian Economic Development Center (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheatre was rented (“Vágszánház”).
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the responsible parties.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was not only open to guests of the NFC, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Approximately 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivities were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music for dancing.
At the request of [origo], it was shared that there was no ball dressing or dressing obligation on the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government are each preparing for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party at all, but to the conference at the end of the year.
It is expected that about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only catering with coffee and pogatsche, the celebration goes out with 350,000 forint.
Minister of Self-Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will just kick in the hall of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas party in its own festive hall, with 436 employees expected.
Spending was measured at 2,500 forints per capita – for that money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kick-off.
Since the beginning of the term of János Veres, the PM’s employees have been celebrating in this way every year.
However, there will be no real party sentiment – not only because of the minister’s official speech, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites a New Year’s reception on January 20, this time the ministry’s Christmas party is out.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenses are set at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception, to which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally start with a short speech by the minister and end with restraint.
As the corresponding press outlets report on [orgo] enquiry, there will be no Christmas party at either the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of the Christmas party, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is hosted in the Arts and Crafts Museum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite strike beginning on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly is held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work stoppage begins.
Strike-related, significant traffic constraints are expected, as rail traffic is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of Monday’s strike will be jointly announced by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large protest assembly will be held on Saturday, and as of Monday, all organizations that joined the strike will resign for an indefinite period of time unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees meet to discuss how to proceed.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that a vote on the health insurance law will be held only in the later evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes starting on Monday will result in significant traffic constraints: the railway workers are laying down their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of Volán companies are stationary.
At the same time, there will be roadblocks in one direction in many places.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have followed the call for strikes - the list of participants is constantly updated on the league website.
Some organizations announced strikes indefinitely, while others are planning a temporary shutdown.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement on sufficient services could be reached between the Hungarian Railway MV and the Free Trade Union of the railways VDSZSZ, although more and more people are travelling by train around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will strike between 7 and 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, the LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy will lay down the work for four hours, and the Teachers’ Union, for example, the Democratic Teachers’ Union, have called for 2- and 2-8-hour strikes, respectively.
The Hungarian Medical Association alternately strikes nationwide at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the league is that the government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and present a new concept for social discourse.
The second demand concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Requirement number three is that the eligible professional groups will have access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, did not accept the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the sidelines and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to Political Capital’s Risk Analysis Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded this August with the support of the “Movement for a Better Hungary”, have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "strengthening of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Gypsies population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is presumably aimed at provoking such a dispute, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of political leaders: "Public people have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposition".
It is assumed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favor extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, “have seriously damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity.”
We remember that since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extremely right-wing groups in Hungary has been on the rise, so that since summer 2007 several organizations called "national self-defense associations" have been established.
“These groups have in common that they each define themselves as a civilian organization, while they openly brag about preparing their members for – sometimes armed – defense tasks (disaster protection, national defense, law enforcement), citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself,” it said.
And further: all this is done according to that method which tries to disguise various political aspirations based on the political and party dissatisfaction of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on civil character and the form of association therefore serve not only to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration in court - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor in relations with neighbouring countries.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, according to some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries, in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he said.
From the research institute’s point of view, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-East Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents as an opportunity to establish the National Guard, arguing that the organization’s goal is “national protection”.
In their opinion, a real "gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
The initiative would have triggered a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they will set up their own guards for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the Political Capital Risk Warning Report.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the intelligence agency: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published, and should risk-altering trends be recognizable, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the release of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of re-disposing the working days around the holidays has now become established, but the coming year brings us fewer such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood by "holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and non-working days.
Work-free days are usually church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year's celebrations can rest.
We have a total of 14 holidays throughout the year.
The national holidays are March 15 which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and October 23, the commemoration day of the revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August we celebrate the founding of the state, on the 1st of May the work, on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of “working day shift” has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finalised, has been determined by the Minister of Labour in its own regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and public service officials.
Excluded are only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on the holidays.
This year, the working order is only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in this country remains formal, as most take the time off for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or take the specially cancelled vacation.
Next year will have more holidays in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer re-dispositions on the working days than this year.
The calendar is first “turned upside down” around the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26th, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd, can be a rest day.
The second redisposition is related to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to process the Friday, October 24th in advance.
However, the end of the year will be completely marked by the holidays, after December 24th everything will lie and stop, even if New Year’s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six Deterrent Little Things to Angry Workmates
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: They bring "color" to everyday life in the workplace.
The only question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or you better face the challenge and try to avoid these unintelligible, annoying situations.
Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called you,” a colleague says.
Did you miss a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by perhaps calling the marketing department and confessing repentantly that you forgot to align the message (this is the less common method).
Usually, the thing is done with an apology.
Before you get involved in embarrassing excuses, consider how you can really give your colleagues unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrowing something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s hardly anything more nervous than reaching for a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without questions, you should not borrow from your colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put envelopes or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more there when you urgently need it.
Talk about the private life of your colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with whom?
Where and why?
One should not bind the information (or assumptions) about the private life of the colleagues to everyone's nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and reveals his inner secret to us, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, rather than aligning the person who is not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Sickly reported for no reason?
When you call in the office to report sick, citing tormenting headaches, because you are feeling uncomfortable right now, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one thing: your own work, unstoppable tasks, projects with fixed deadlines now have to be done by your colleagues instead of by yourself.
So don't be fooled by your colleagues!
If you know the day before that you won’t make it to the office the next day, or that something could get in between, why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Cumshot, Geek, Phone calls
One is just deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud gossip of the colleagues?
Unwanted to listen to a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
One should not annoy colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (that one leads over their heads), tramplement, constant scolding or nagging.
All of this can be very annoying, even if they are not currently immersed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not finished on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not seek the blame of your own forgetfulness from others!
If possible, you should not be excused for the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or make up for the missed one, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and slippers: Convenient for at home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then should you dress so casually, if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress appropriately in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Everyone wants to make it right - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody echoes from the radio: the sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is Zagar's song "Wings of Love" that resounds on mr2.
The local music scene hasn’t spoiled us with quality electropop for a long time.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the home digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even when the garage skirt with its guitar quit is again "in", the home electropop proves: there is new under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, playing himself in the band Yonderboi, before he started his own way - perhaps because a tavern does not tolerate two pipers.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, he only made with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film that had approached him (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török.
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ranked its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, became the almost only trendsetter, also marketable in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they also liked to wear this brand.
The band has reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album titled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new avenues for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The term comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still traveling with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar - corresponding to the zeitgeist and the trends - the influences of rock'n'roll stand out.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere at Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to a radio hit - the latest from early to late pop music broadcasting mr2 Petáfi has successively set the earworm to the listeners with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and insignificant, but they can also only be produced for sale, which turns them into commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motif.
The listener’s willingness to listen also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling to see more and more coming to our concerts.
We have never written for the market.
Music is not created for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but it is only in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, one thing I noticed: If you want to make it right for everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, apart from trying to interpret this into our music again and again.
We see ourselves more as team players who rely on each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: "Wings of Love" comes first in the charts of Mr2 Petáfi.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a somewhat more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We didn’t have any plans to write a hit that would then be used as a drawhorse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult themes.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly you, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to compose the choir from gifted soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-piece choir came into being - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Eniki Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later named "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls help shape it?
Zs: The song has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this song still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
Everything was practically straightforward and terrifyingly spontaneous.
I remember I was quite electrified at the time, but the "Divas" were already needed.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There’s no solo part (apart from Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have their own role, sing perfectly together and are no louder than the music, so their singing isn’t just accompanied by the music.
They were also on the back stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a bit, forgetting who came from where and where to go, let’s just let these particular wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
Hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creative work actually none, there have been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, with "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert keyboard, or with "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't work any longer, but gradually everything came together as if it were a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and even now that I have the album "let go".
Currently, it's "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the song "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions for feelings of inferiority
Soilless Scam
This is how his former employee Jerome Kerviel is referred to as the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local bank of the Como.
It came by almost five billion euros because of him.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, and was certainly not incapable of doing so.
In contrast to all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in good time.
"He's rather weak mentally," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who pointed him to the police.
However, as shown by Kerviel’s statements published by the French media, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a person who had made a profit of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He had already spotted the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had payment problems earlier, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
“Even when I made the first half a billion, I didn’t know how to explain that,” Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn’t keep anything to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he has faked documents so that he is not caught in the crooks.
He even managed to mislead his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk Profit
Was he afraid to fly?
Hardly.
“I thought it would satisfy the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank.”
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to gradually develop his position.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became a self-employed broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew that he would never earn as much as others.
“As long as I had my first conversation in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
With the shares of the alliance, he earned a lot by betting half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we let you
“It’s like a snowball,” he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew or knew everything.
“As long as I made money, I closed my eyes.”
But then, at the beginning of this year, the big blow came.
In a single day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find him?
Suspiciously, he made his way through a vacation.
“I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want you to look at him in the cards,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, through which the Czech Republic can reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kroner) in the next few years.
This is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into the expansion of traffic.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Business and Innovation" programme aims to attract entrepreneurs and companies to innovative ventures.
The companies are to gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
In the previous money acquisition from EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the new candidate countries with the least success so far.
Nicaraguan Court Confirms Twenty Years in Prison for Ex-Presidents
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed the twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the news agency AP.
According to the chairman of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detainees whether to let Alemán sit his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court proved four years ago that Alemán had regularly shifted government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional, and the accounts were actually owned by his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
The budget is through
Yes, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has drafted and that was adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
That for the current year was still approved with the support of the Social Democrats (SSD) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him, and therefore the SSD could not afford to reject him.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives quietly endorsed this law, which has traditionally been ignored but is still of the utmost importance.
This is, in a way, paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an integral part of politics, but is obscured by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and that is why they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses among the previous Social Democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate all at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is mandatory by law, which is not only pensions, but also social spending, which was decided by the "silent" coalition of SSD and KS-M (Communists) last year before the elections.
The second is deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third constraint is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors spent, in addition to income from taxes, levies, and bank loans, to tap into other sources of investment, often inconsiderately issuing bonds through which they overindebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have succeeded in paying off these debts by selling massive shares of the energy and other utilities that they received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now this source is already dead.
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth for several years, which the SSD boasts of unceasingly.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our republic.
This is a huge disgrace, mainly attributable to the former governments.
We are among the countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
That is why there is no need for massive social programs, which unfortunately have been inflated to a gigantic extent in recent years.
Even though it has succeeded in eliminating some of the nonsensical populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no shift in retirement age and pension reform in the near future, virtually any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will remain but pure administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social spending.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner planned for 2008 would certainly be superfluous if previous governments had not spent what they could have spent in the last decade.
If we do not want it to really happen that ruling politicians become pure administrative officials, then we need to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take in taxes and fees, to wish for rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow for a gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to cope with the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
For example, more than $100 billion will be auctioned into the currency markets.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the U.S. Fed is sending $40 billion to auction, with another 24 making it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to counteracting or mitigating the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This move is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in a report for his clients.
“The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in non-serviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more to be lost.
“Central banks must have been really afraid of what could come next when they decided to do this,” said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, potentially affecting economic growth around the world.
After failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used in lending money between banks, central banks have decided to do so.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money to each other, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to hurt developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus once again commented on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the final international conference of the UN on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet", he stated that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mix of government officials and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it's a word fireworks that is just a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech president emphasized that his subject matter was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
Now, interested parties can read his attitude uninterruptedly.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but he thought he had sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, capable of understanding and judging technical treatises, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he called the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore not a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others; he sees this as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driving license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for the exchange, so that the authorities can manage to issue a new driver’s license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the roads without a valid driving permit.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not exchanged their driving license.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in the fireshow exchange, the capital’s offices are overwhelmed with applications, and interest in the exchange continued to grow this week.
The city council handles around 2,000 customers every day.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving license.
The issuance of a new driving license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who do not make the required exchange by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license, threaten a fine from January.
The perpetrator pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
But the police can also use it with a reminder in the case of the offense.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may increase to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even those who are not driving can be punished by the community.
He could, it was said, face a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry already called on the offices to exercise mildness and impose a maximum penalty of 1,000 crowns.
According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand-crown penalty.
A driver’s license is a document where everyone can decide whether they want to own it or not.
It is not an identity card that everyone, and indeed a valid one, must have.
People who no longer want to drive should issue their driver’s license.
It is enough to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers will gradually have to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million additional driving licenses.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Kocaik, who are accused of having made joint business with David Berdych’s gang, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years, respectively.
This was decided in a final ruling by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced her sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organised Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today’s judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also indicted in this matter, but first he is faced with the first instance judgment.
In other trials, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned to more.
In January, a district court found 19 people guilty mainly of involvement in robberies, and today the Higher Regional Court negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the charges from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with Berdych criminals, among other things, provided information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to avoid prosecution.
The gang left 30 percent of the loot to Opava and Kosak.
The indictment deals with crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Particularly because of robbery, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also because of impeachment and illicit possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with a steel core, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to the accusation, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns by their robberies.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, Berdych and a number of others were found guilty of further robbery.
Other men from Berdych’s area have to answer in another trial, further cases have not yet been brought to court.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tomás Pátá and Maroás Ulej, who are in Irish custody and waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation from the hospital in T'eb' 12 million crowns plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent.
Therefore, the hospital's legal representative, Ondáej Dostál, does not agree at all with Velebas's proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too high a multiple," Dostál said after today's trial.
"But in order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the opposite side had drawn up.
We will determine if it has any value at all.
But we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone together,” said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the Jablosov family wanted a million crowns for every month they hadn’t raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion prepared for him by the university hospital in Prague, Motol.
The children’s parents suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying strengths and depths, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry.
The men better tolerated the stress situation, even though they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope less with the aftermath of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is currently going on, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity hospital in Táebó on 9 December last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the "Ermáks" in Pibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Broc and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablocov.
At the end of October, the county chief of the Vysocina (Bohemian Moravian Heights) handed over 100,000 crowns to each family in exchange for expenses that had been incurred by the mistake of the hospital in the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured.
In case of doubt, they must seek a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can apply for assistance from the carrier.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low amounts of damages, the amounts were determined by tables and ranged in the hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polivka came to his kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polávka lost the dispute over the "Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian King", but the project had built up a team around Tomás Harabi in many years of work in collaboration with the actor.
Poluvka did not take part in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not finished and his client will probably appeal.
“The dispute is about Mr. Harabi and his team want to share in Bolek Polivka’s popularity parasitically,” Polivka’s lawyer said after the trial.
Everyone introduced themselves to this actor and comedian in the words "Walachian Kingdom".
The same is true of Harabi.
“We’ve been working for almost 10 years.
Procurement of money and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a dispute over money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasitically at our work,” he continued.
Lukrative business
According to the court, Polávka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat.
But this was not at that time related to the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi came up with the idea of spending Walachian passports.
From an originally fun action crystallized a business and an entrepreneurial activity, to which Harabi then joined the founding of the company "Walachisches Königreich".
In 1997, Polávka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered its owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabi was using only the mere idea Polivka had made public in the program "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"Polivkas' popularity certainly helped the project of the Walachian Kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi and his team, who had devoted themselves intensively to it.
The cooperation of the parties that are divided today lasted until the year 2000, when Harabic organized the official coronation for Polivka in Vsetin.
Since then, however, the disputes that culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected until St. Nicholas's Day" began to accumulate between Polovka and Harabi.
The leadership then took place at the suggestion of Harabi’s Jarmila Suláková as Queen Mother.
In 2002, he filed a lawsuit against Harabi and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring Harabi's prepared competition for the throne and half a princess.
There should be a new king from there.
He did not yet want to reveal details and an appointment.
“We don’t want to hurry.
It was supposed to be something like the king's move in Walachey.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Poluvka can also sign up quietly," Harabi added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Fronts diminish
To be honest, I was never a fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearshift, steering and also the workmanship could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The station wagon called SW is a little further, and I just have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of headroom in the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly on
I only briefly go through the interior so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a very successful design, where I have objections only because of the miserable middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design design, where the car would otherwise make such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we might complain about too short seats or headrests.
The side support has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the station wagon, the already mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the cargo space.
I have to describe it (also because of the folding back window) as very loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with retaining straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and also hold heavy objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment is 428 liters, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is left behind by significantly noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when inviting a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positives, I have to mention the very flat loading space or the very low loading edge after the rear seats have been folded.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with 1.6 liters and an output of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that's what a 1600-cubic engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and moves well.
If I compare him to his counterpart at skoda, who sometimes seems like his exhaust is stuffed with a rag, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
However, we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still going up.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot already.
The premium equipment of the test car beats again with 80,000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper release, electric rear window lifts and...
The total cost of the car is 531900 kroner.
That’s a lot, but add the additional equipment of a Fabia and you’ll arrive at a very similar amount.
So there is only the choice of which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from countries in Eastern Europe is increasing, raising fears among locals about the further development of local schooling.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has hitherto encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case of North Kent, where disputes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and robbery among students have spread to relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed so far that police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself by saying that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene after an attack by two minor girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and stoned him.
“When we went home, a boy climbed on a bush and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks,” a mother of Slovak students told The Times.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited testify that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here looking for a job.
Approximately 3,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will come true if you choose just the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and enchanting cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American epoch.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the US (especially during the prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, and cars were driving across the broad boulevards that were among the iconic symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
Cocktails can be mixed at the bar at Hotel Nacional.
And the cult cars of the fifties still drive around in Havana today, because the once imported schigulis and fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Havana, in particular its oldest part, may have fallen heavily, nowhere in the vicinity can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being cleaned out, such as Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguin and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers yet another marrot that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow gauges to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see nice and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long since been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
The most important places do not let out the majority of visitors to Cuba.
There is no need to write about Varadero or Havana.
All that remains to be mentioned is that in the aforementioned estate of Hemingway there is a museum whose visit should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Vieste Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities fertile soil accumulated, through which even weathered rocky areas are covered by thick vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet it when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Fame and wealth came to her from the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the pretty beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the fifties of the last century that would have connected the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to it being ignored.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the "Valley of Sugar Factories".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Musica, which revives after dark, and where the music does not remain silent until morning.
Baracoa
This town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Certainly this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads that lead from Guantanamo have to cross high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape barely touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its World Heritage Directory thanks to its unspoilt nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill, where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, there are several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the best known.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra-Maestra Mountains, the bay of pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion that the descendants of slaves profess, about all this you could write many pages.
But, as they say, it’s better to look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, in the words of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas, and the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance on the part of the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defense minister Robert Gates, called on NATO units to increase activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
“Afghanistan is experiencing progress, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is allowing residents to start developing their own economy and security,” Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The Afghan insurgents’ activity has reached the highest level in five years, according to the U.S. Army.
The number of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
NATO countries have deployed about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them,” Gates said.
The same was said today by NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop.
“I am not pleased with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s too little,” De Hoop told Reuters agency at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute over the last few months as to whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country,” Gates said.
The British tabloid "Sun" this week referred to the German soldiers as lazy.
"Afghan Non-Supreme Uncovers: The Germans are making games while our boys are fighting," the Sun wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper went over to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84000 kroner.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to go into debt this year with 159.2 billion cones.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Treasury Department confirmed its data on the public debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech owes 84000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion kroner.
“Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we may not cross the trillion kroner limit until 2009.
Next year, debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion kroner,” said David Marek, analyst at Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Vladimir Pikora, analyst for Next Finance, said: “We could get over from a trillion in 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If it turns out that the situation is changing on the political stage, and if politicians are willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I don’t expect such a change,” he noted.
Debt is Growing
The national debt comes from the debt of the state government and mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by treasury notes, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic debt has risen to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The government’s foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable national debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
Total debt increased 13 percent over the year from the first quarter to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth can be seen mainly in the debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that you can do something even before the pension reform comes,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The 2007 financing strategy and government debt management showed that the government had planned to take in 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns, thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum of 13.3 billion kroner for the consolidation agency, a 10 billion reserve to pay pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion kroner and 1.8 billion kroner for bonds from the European Investment Bank.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was brought before a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison and subsequently expulsion by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name of Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic Prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of students complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School in Khartoum, was picked up at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school principal Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first names.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear itself did not carry a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic Prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well, and she would never have done anything that could be too close to a religious belief, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is just an innocent mistake.
A view that many students share with the teacher, which they describe as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in the classroom.
Keep in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given name in the UK, for which 14 different spelling methods exist in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of veneration to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner urged Belgrade and Pristina to meet their commitments to maintain peace and continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of conciliation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% of Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian intermediary Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiating session since last August the troika had received the order from the UN for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo’s independence from the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains an advocate of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, Botsane-Chartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After having been under UN administration for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to unilaterally announce them if the Security Council should not decide in their favor.
Belgrade calls for greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
He added, however, that Belgrade’s proposed plan for autonomy belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that there is a “domino effect” in a region that has been weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be made solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally holds a veto.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only one decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists were told by Fatmir Sejdiu that Kosovo’s parliament would have the final say on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanian-speaking population would proceed in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush unveils agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which gathered under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately aim for a peace treaty to clarify all open issues without exception, and including the key issues.
This designation encompasses the three major issues that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians mainly revolve around: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland, which lies in the present state of Israel, as a result of the 1948 conflict.
After the American president took the floor, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all issues, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he pledged that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption, and that he would endeavour to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two states, a Palestinian and an Israeli coexisting, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received assurances from Bush in this sense before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries to offer Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, says the Saudi Arabian prince in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are facing each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on strike, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a police spokesman.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without registration, i.e. not approved for public road traffic (see below), came, driven by two young people without a helmet, at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after disregarding its advance from the right, a police officer continued.
The alcohol control carried out on the vehicle passengers is a lot negative.
The condition of the car (splittered fender, split windshield, demolished bumper) testifies to the heaviness of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main district authority for public safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she is excluding the investigation of the IGPN at this stage of the responsibility of the police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small motorcycle has come to her left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the floor, showed that the two vehicles had been stuck together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical review.
The corpses of the two victims were reported yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel a rumor quickly made the round, according to which the police had left the place of the accident very quickly, and this without providing the two young people help.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude any serious error concerning this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, for which further investigations are needed, and which must be done very carefully.
Libération met an eyewitness of those few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed police officer who was lagging.
Two more tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth phoned.
Given the tension that had quickly formed around the event and, it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescuers arrived about twenty minutes after the police officers left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces did not help the young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
The fire department arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed.
Tension is increasing in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police struck down the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was declared two days earlier by General Musharraf.
According to witness reports, in the town of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken within the framework of the emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades deployed by the police forces there.
They then threw stones with which they wounded the police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were temporarily detained.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositionists, human rights advocates and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyers movement on Monday received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president called on the population to send flowers to the judges who opposed the emergency and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
He had to take a stand on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in a direct election on October 6.
The president of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
Everything we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional, and contrary to Supreme Court decisions, the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s pledge to give command of the army and become a civilian president has not been valid since the invocation of the emergency, Tariq Azeem, vice-minister of information, said on Monday.
He was expected to hand over his military uniform until November 15, the date of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are not planned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of female pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
Today, eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
In one in five couples, even calculated accurately on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the International Space Station (ISS) crew will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools crafted by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is expected to soon take up European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-ton solar panel power generation module that was already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After it had shifted, the crew began to restructure the solar panels of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can be folded up like accordions was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter.
Restructuring was stopped so as not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a check-up and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-meter-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle attached to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old learned doctor was selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rails to the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey racket, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station devised and crafted.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the collector to fully unfold before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today’s seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery to start their return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS on the stock market sanctioned
After the Aviation and Defense Group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counteract the residues of the A400M, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to reconsider its business forecasts for 2007, referring to the residues caused by the slow progression of the engine of the A400M, which delayed the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost announced in October to offset the delay in delivery of their military transport aircraft is between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent company of European manufacturer EADS.
Because of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month lag.
As a reminder, the EADS business performance has fallen from 86% in 2006, largely due to the cost of delaying another program, that of the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Choosing the status quo
On Sunday, the counting of the urns will not be exciting: the mass of Russians will opt for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, it confirms its pursuit of stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message on public channels to voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is announcing.
Yesterday, the president failed to see anything when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to deliver a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference – his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have lost themselves.
It denounces an election campaign stained by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After suppressing last weekend’s demonstrations, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for illicit demonstrations, according to his lawyer.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two far-reaching questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as President?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first round of presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was re-elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and the almighty party United Russia, which will elect the government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their fate, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further back: bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of community has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin reconnected with the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so as this new paternalism was not followed by terror but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility that they have shown for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
Why consider it for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional leaders) lead the local election lists of the United Russia.
The new liberties coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as they were in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednichenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why long to consider?
Those in power are not so bad, why replace them?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed on a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and by name, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states entrusted with managing them, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
delicate information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will enable them to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps, and the health status of forced labourers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
Nonetheless, some of the scientific community shows limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One should not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, explained in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Mutual trade between India and Europe is currently reaching 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light to open negotiations last April with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will drive the two economies forward enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe constitutes the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued. The Asian and European giants annually exchange goods worth 47 billion euros and services worth 10 billion euros, had this week Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, declared, and regretted that the mutual trade has not yet reached its potential at the European Commission.

The Bank of England notes the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern about curbing the currently recurring concern about credit terms, announcing an offer of ten billion pounds at a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
In order to alleviate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they should organize their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open-market operation.
The bank further states that this way, on December 6th, by 12.15 GMT, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the property tax rate and only until January 10.
This seems to be the first time that BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its notice that it is prepared to take further action to receive the interest rates of interbank loans with their basic interest rate, which vary from day to day.
The interbank interest rate, which varies from day to day, was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has narrowed to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis this summer, the sums circulated by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that had prevented the banks from using them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound price as opposed to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums brought into circulation by the European Central Bank at more advantageous interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text.
The text, created as part of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), stated about ten measures that had been adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, the majority of which were 50% for the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPP floatante, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against examining the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some fierce debates between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television post on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the entirety of their proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances, which had been reviewed by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 said on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world’s most prestigious festivals.
In 1989 he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, also takes care of the production, the licensing concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he’s ever attended, says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are eagerly working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, Charlie Jones says.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Luckily, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and make preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in 2005 at the Grand Park Chicago, after profiled itself in the festival world in 2002 along with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events each generated $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax revenues in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a rural festival, while ours is more likely to take place on urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
"The goal is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, while at the same time giving the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban one in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is happy to take on the burden of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and record a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s recording capacity is “very large,” corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasty rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His partners at C3, who won the Top Independent Promoter Award at the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It’s not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no lesser than the Terminator opposes it.
These locking attempts are part of the delegate tasks.
A politically "sensitive mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governor"?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best,” he says.
Run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the advancement of the local cinema is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the west coast, though Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing the Quebec films, evaluating them and making sure the producers give interviews.
The Dark Age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be featured at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be featured at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also featured four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing a year-end rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks until the end of the year on the stock market, investors are already rubbing their hands in view of the upcoming final year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts can not make sure predictions in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock market usually goes hand in hand with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts on a short-term basis and only on the basis of statistics, especially if serious tensions determine the current market situation.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, who invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secure equity funds, which is heavily affected by the upward trend towards high-yield assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock market will be more likely to show a rather lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, mainly because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the potential fall in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the rising price of crude oil and the risk of the rise in inflation.
Javier Barrio, Head of Sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak on 8 November of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully close the year by nearly 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of mutual funds and the traditional pension fund subsidy at this time every year.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop slightly differently, especially due to the end-of-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and thus immediately after the day of the bridge to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the market situation is at an almost technical level, which could soon result in a deviation from index values whose extent depends on the consequences of the U.S. mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
When it comes to selecting the values to push the Ibex to new heights, analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney affirms that this year's big values are at their turn.
Among the value winners, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at some point in time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be associated with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
ACS has been on a catch-up course in recent months and we hope other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, according to the expert.
With regard to the increased consumption behavior during the Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine market events in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only seen two declines in price.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real year rally so far.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, December showed a 6.68% increase in price.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth year in a row (the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and also a final year rally will show.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of these are located in the strongest economic regions in Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, as Popular is the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 20.30h and start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The bank’s current negotiations with the trade unions seem to aim for an agreement in which 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturday and open on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to opening hours, will depend on the experience of Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those stores that, due to their location, can capture the commercial customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
To this end, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the stores, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The bank’s representative, Angel Rivera, assures that the restructuring did not require major investments, but was accompanied by an increased recruitment, as a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O’Donell and Gran V’a have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2,500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these stores of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to be a competitor for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally agreed to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking personnel.
Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time, surpassing its rival Antena 3.
We've done it.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that’s exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they did not fall too low.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This profit reduces its losses to 15.66% so far this year.
According to Bloomberg, corporate value now reaches 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento holding only 13%.
The Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to half at 2,193.46 million.
The market value of other publicly traded communications companies, on the other hand, is rising; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Dias) to 2,518.53 million and in Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that they are two similar companies, according to Vasile.
It is still uncertain to what extent we can actually act on the stock market, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first TV channel this year with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues, as assured by Guiseppe Tringali, the Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaspaa, the group's advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the television business was only able to show an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor in Telecinco’s comparatively better stock market performance is seen by analysts in the high payout ratio that the company has had to date: In 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarrára initiated a 100 percent dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as its parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more so far.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced Antena 3’s expected profit calculation by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (buy) a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (hold) due to multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan recommends resetting expectations in both cases in light of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
Congress approved the MIFID directive, which came into force on November 1.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which ended its session today with the Senate congressional decision on the additional/amendments related to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congress and senate members, who had in their negotiations and votes pursued the goal of establishing the best possible regulation that ensures the security of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which re-defines the securities services regulation, pursues an improvement in investor protection, the increase in the control entitlement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables financial advice to be provided to both specialized firms and to natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the advisory firms that partner with the investment and brokerage firms of securities.
In addition, it expands the number of financial transaction execution systems, adding to the regulated circulation markets the multilateral securities trading systems and the systems for internationalising trade orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the focus of their company profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks in the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Congressional Economic Commission proposed further changes in retrospect, with the decision that titled bonds must now be considered as complex funds for the investor due to their high degree of risk has been confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the fields of work of qualified economists was used; 30 years after the 1977 regulation, which restricted the areas of work reserved for economists, was adopted.
The Senate, in turn, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the business mediator, who works on a third-party account, does not require authorization on the part of the CNMV and can offer its services to commercialize products and attract customers simultaneously to multiple investment companies.
The harmonised index of consumer prices (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare location and quality with US products by publishing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be created prematurely by applying the same procedure as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the pre-determined indicator would only serve as a guideline and therefore would not be in line with the final result announced on 14 December.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at relatively high levels
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Economic and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November is a temporary development; at the same time, it assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current figure is not good, the inflation difference between Spain and the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economy and Finance announced with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock’s assets have fallen by more than half after the bank requested emergency loans from the British central bank in mid-September last year, and they now amount to only 12,000 million pounds (equivalent to 16,800 million euros).
At that time, the bank’s assets amounted to a record 25,000 million pounds, a sum that decreased significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of trust in customers and despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue to run the group under the Virgin Money brand name, will have to contribute about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be made up of investments there over the next three years, in order to acquire exactly the same 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve its goal of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, who is known for his eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to pour 50,000 million pounds (equivalent to approximately 70 million euros) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve his goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, which has three more companies involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for allegedly participating in urban corruption
Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the Murcia township of Totano (Partido Popular) this morning, due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martánez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales last May, currently a deputy of the Popular Party and then chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, and, according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER, could be the original mastermind of the conspiracy.
The officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and thus privileged deputy Juan Morales was arrested when he left his client’s residence due to important burdensome documents allegedly related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on Morales’ alleged commission payments to a Galician construction company, which envisaged the conclusion of a urban contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory of the Socialists, to assume the office of Congressional President.
José Blanco, PSOE’s organisational secretary, and Bono announced it at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero was held today at the party’s headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the upcoming elections, the mancha-born politician would appear to be running for the party as chairman of the congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martin as congressional president, who announced last November that he would no longer compete in the next general elections, end his career in public policy, and instead work in the university field for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the president had continually pressed for his return to political events.
He also pointed out that, as with the appointment of the Vice President of Economics, the party did not want to deprive citizens of who would take over the post of Congress President in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or scream, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time, one gets the impression that the only place where one cannot speak calmly and calmly in Madrid is the Congress; so the President of the Government in the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martan and his good work, suggesting that he did not want to give the impression that he had already taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call this an arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
As the climate debate is subject to relentless criticism by both climate sceptics and those who put a social and political debate in the foreground, the movement as a whole must demonstrate strong cohesion.
Especially when it comes to a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to sign a new contract with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in a predicament regarding the actions or non-action of his government, which has made a decisive contribution to Spain being at the top of the countries within the EU that have least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are responsible for failing to meet the targets, which sectors this is due to, and why has his government, which had proposed the contract with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to explain to the Spanish citizens the measures he has envisaged against climate change without any doubt.
Which companies will be affected, what behaviour of the citizens should be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and what economic consequences this will have.
More specifically, who will have to sacrifice himself and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there are and will be no such explanations in the future.
Especially because it’s about sacrifice and paying.
Because the measures that can be implemented against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE appeared to be so strategically dangerous that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician who would otherwise be so suitable for election campaigns does not have to speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of adorning the meetings and enthralling others with his meekness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcia-owned town of Totana, the popular politician José Martanez Andreo, and the local police chief, the secretary of the mayoral office and a hotel businessman for suspecting urban planning violations, it was said today from investigative circles.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is to this day, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and at the municipal building management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are in connection with the searches that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of unexplored building land for urban projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which was to build 4,000 apartments on the property after the local administration received illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not directly arrested, but underwent an investigation, which is initiated and conducted by the first court of Totonas.
The first six arrests were brought before the judge today.
According to investigative circles, investigations are also being conducted against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP member Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend residing in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the group Nuaria, the Vigo-born lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is said to have acted as a subgroup of Nuaria and received the bribe.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out 11 additional searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming business, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the Murcia-owned village, which would include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, with the aim of realizing a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the parking spaces of the Coruca, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico streets in Vigo; Hogartel, whose activities are limited to the sector of direct marketing; and Preconiza, which specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression Book of the Month and try instead to invent a price designation of another name with appropriate competencies.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are welcome to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the commentary published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the commentary published in the same newspaper on November 18; accidentally on the day of which the criticism of Blackburn’s book was published.
The content of the subject Philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school graduate who quoted in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, chairman of the Education Council for the Philosophy Department, urged teachers to take a more critical position against Plato and suggested that Plato’s teaching be removed from the sub-level curricula for the Philosophy Department at Gymnasiums.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which is considered to be six months in prison.
But once again, if you rob a music store under the value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than with a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and give it back forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than when you download it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious dispute entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data entails a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films whose authorization by the authors has not taken place shall be subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic footage to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague is right, then someone has quite screwed up his demands.

My family doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles titled: Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was compiled using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the science journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Life&Brain Brain Research Center in Bonn, activation was strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct with their response and thus received the same level; but when one of them received double, there was also stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to reach such a result.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been searching relentlessly for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years, and her seat is in the prosecutor’s office of the criminal court of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and a laughing eye, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre - which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - are ex-General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic.
Their names are on the list, which the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet started in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, pursues the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her intention to track down the escaped criminals and put their respective governments under pressure.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers a possible loss caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which again depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of preparation of the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right vehicle insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged in return to submit the corresponding compensation amount in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that is composed of several factors, including age, gender, time of preparation of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that if there is a higher risk of accidents, higher contributions will also be due.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make fewer contributions, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since according to the statistical values and thus also according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to have fewer accidents than single persons.
The benefit that is attributed to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that is most likely to meet his or her personal needs.
We now list the most important points to consider when choosing an insurance policy, in order to be able to make not only a performance-oriented but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds encounter numerous obstacles when choosing low-cost insurance, such as the low driving practice and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to take out a full-cash insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full-casco with deductible, so that the services of a full-casco insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract involves the customer having to pay a portion of the amount incurred by the damage itself.
The amount will be determined before the contract is concluded and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s chief representative at First Europa, a broker for online insurance.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against damage caused to their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a piece of advice.
If you’re under 25, it’s up to you to reduce insurance costs; this way your credit will increase by trying to drive cautiously and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction of the basic rate at the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in said tariffs.
The amount of credits and fines depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a high-yield year behind it, it may allow itself to increase bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to enter into a contract. This is due to the fact that as driving practice increases, the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most sensible to opt for a full-cash insurance with equity.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the beginner's anxiety has been removed.
Nevertheless, for a married customer who does not have children, it is more advisable to take out full insurance; of course, only if it also allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the part of the insurers, couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly their contributions are low.
In this case, a full-cash insurance with deductible (with an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance policy is recommended, which only starts in the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to set a higher contribution payment, notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a full-cash insurance with a deductible (for an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, it is important to note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accidental damage, but also because it carries high costs that require a thorough selection that fits our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to finish eighth in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight in San Siro next Tuesday for the point they are missing to reach their respective goals before the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the Scots decide on their participation.
The Italian team already has five points and have confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not overtake the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D games will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where it will fight for the first time in the semi-finals for entry into the final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished before everyone else and the draw in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the all-expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow knows that in the event of a victory they would be group first and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be defeated by a lap of FC Shakhtar to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because on nine points of parity the Ukrainians were allowed to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
The Milanese are hoping to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after being defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the follow-up time (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the final.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri to win, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the eighth final and joining UEFA will depend on their victory and defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls in Vancouver, Canada, kicked off their first tour after the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to witness the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video of the history of the band, which had caused a sensation at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, which will be released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on stage, which Posh Spice's husband, English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the crowds that made the GM Palace glow, even though the nerves of his wife Victoria had banned him in previous days.
During the preparations for Schow, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star has never seen our wardrobe, so I’m really excited about what he’ll think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose exit from the group in 1998 resulted in the dissolution of the group two years later, expressed her nervousness at a press meeting two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that’s why I thought why not, so I’m glad I made this decision, Chisholm commented on the breakup of the band that had prompted it nine years ago.
The singer also announced that the disputes had been resolved and that everyone was now very fond of each other again.
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls last appeared together in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver, according to the TV station CTV in a special machine of Virgin Airlines.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nanny.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will be on stage in Madrid on December 23rd.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute swells between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian fuel exports to Western Europe being compromised.
Most of Russia’s natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent quarrel between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks,” Ukraine’s economic minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] through Ukraine.”
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a fall in exports to Western Europe, which pushed prices drastically upwards.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas deposits in the world, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the checks on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body said.
The recommendation of chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish state health service has no exact idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were performed correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at the Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in the UK.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out checks prior to hiring foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the agency does not have the authority to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor’s report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should adopt guidelines of the criminal record extract, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these checks in some personnel records, they were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said Scottish health authorities would highly follow their investigative guidelines prior to hiring, but added: “Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information is available on the number of foreign health care workers.”
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was “extremely unlikely” that investigations ahead of hiring potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
“The report states that current NHS Scotland pre-employment tests are working well and it’s not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver,” he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the board members had trouble identifying those employees who were on leave indefinitely.
The investigation also found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were predominantly observed.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Nicola Sturgeon, Secretary of Health, said: "It was my concern to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on pre-employment checks by all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is scheduled for next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards ceremony
Control, the film biography of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the best film.
Prizes were also awarded to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench has been named best actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for making the British film world-famous.
The prizes were handed over in a ceremony at London’s Roundhouse.
Control follows Curti’s rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was shot for only 3 million pounds.
Nevertheless, he has won two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, most likely known to date for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best director's debut.
Rock music was the centerpiece of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about clash singer Joe Strummer was awarded the prize for the best documentary.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has won the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my type of person, a great actor of his time, I’m really honored.”
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect plants following a failed Al Quaida attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing a domestic statement, says 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile expert” who illegally immigrated into the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees were reportedly planning to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis who are striving for Iraq to join forces with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias see many clergymen in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the past five months," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a “media cell” of 16 from Medina, which was aimed at promoting “Takfiri thinking” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a glimpse of the future of Earth
Venus may have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft orbiting an orbit show that the planet resembles an averted twin of the Earth even more than previously was aware.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But due to the unrestrained carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation, and a slower rotational rate, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has been investigating the plant for a year, provide a sobering glimpse of how the Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the heads of the Venus Express mission, said, “It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar.”
“Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment.”
'Enriched uranium' confiscated by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and that the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency ultimately agreed to face a debate on YouTube in which normal voters record and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, exactly reflected the state of the Republican Party, which breaks into the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with the selection of YouTube clips to be shown to the prospective candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest one dedicated to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
This is one of the most important issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed peaks of approval as the candidates spoke strictly across borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation of being complacent about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two argued particularly violently when questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to catch up on this issue.
Neither of the two men has serious chances of being nominated, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they hit the immigration gap earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, candidates broadly share the same views: tighter borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became clearly problematic as other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani has been asked why he has supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to argue that although the Bible was his favorite book, he might not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now in first place against all expectations in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism – said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed on whether Jesus would support them, he laughed at them and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul’s recent donation successes and his applause storms in Wednesday’s debate.
These two were shot up out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the very beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No noble titles seem to be sold, no Parisian politician pays hotel bills, no extramarital toes have been sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has disguised donations to the British ruling Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the contested Gordon Brown would have done well.
When, two months ago, the Prime Minister had withdrawn from the call for an election, in a stupid way offensive to the intelligence of the British, claiming that opinion polls had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly keen representative leader of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once feared Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The awkward rescue of Northern Rock, a battered bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change tax laws have raised corporate associations against the government.
The tax-administrative loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative purgatory.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: being Minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary General (and her former Executive Director) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably heading for resignation.
Yet governments can reach a turning point after which they find it impossible to govern.
People may not trust or trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it becomes clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he doesn’t even need to be there for long, this postponement is over: the public service is starting to leak; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-in-chief.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are related to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's mishaps -- as with the long "money for noble titles" investigation of political party funding -- voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown's location isn't quite as bad as it looks
The wrongdoing is not as horrible as the conservatives describe it.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely tricked.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is delivering what Brown’s, of course, Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new guild of political donations is a good example.
The garboeske Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his benevolence.
It may be so, but it was not up to him to decide.
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he would have known about Abraham’s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will naturally have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s main fundraiser, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown hasn’t been involved: there’s nothing to suggest he knew about these confusions, even though most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by grabbing a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led to the full measure, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "learnings to be drawn from this" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown needs to do, such as find a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Public Standards, which has been unoccupied for six months, and move forward with a major reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour Party to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party mate like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to regain voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through unquestionable righteousness and solid competence.
Map sharks
Is the credit crisis fuelling America’s credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that back fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is sickening, the predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of infecting underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both buchungen and default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not withdrawn or are more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion toll collection from its American consumer finances, partly because of the weakness of credit card holders.
It is too early to panic.
Losses and omissions are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter default rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in U.S. private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy filings, which in turn accounted for a large part of the kedit card losses; the number of filings (and thus default fees) would increase again, whether the general terms for borrowers are deteriorating or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates showing how much of its debt consumers pay off every month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that spending for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take credit card debt, now that home loans are drying out.
The card issuers, however, look at the cash flow rather than capital values, which is why falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be beneficial for card issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall when the properties are less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react to the more stormy conditions much faster and more flexibly than lenders by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of the assets.
“We won’t wake up one day and completely reassess the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are significantly more real.
If lower house prices and a credit cut push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grim future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers to be tried for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial manager, Andrew Fastow, changed their applications to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent for seven cases of telecommunications fraud for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial scam in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing in U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case is a loose end of an investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the target of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The indictment of the bankers – called the “NatWest Three” – claims they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, which was controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron ventures that helped to rip the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow mistakenly represented to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others sank about $12.3 million, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty on two charges of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in the Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and a month at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was at liberty due to a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States in anticipation of trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh largest company, crumbled into bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer make billions of dollars’ debt seem profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than $2 billion in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles related to the Enron collapse.
Skilling is subject to a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were nullified after he died last year of heart disease.
Not at the bottom in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least $54 million.
But that's small money for some of the rich Russians.
“It can accommodate up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you ask for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the millionaires’ exhibition, a four-day orgy of exhibited consumption hosted in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had set up exhibition stands, hoping to interest new Russians in everything from mahogany-laminated yachts to diamond-plated car grilles that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the nearest exhibition stand.
“This is a nice car, but it’s small money compared to us,” he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas did in its heyday.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went in droves to Europe, where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the most visible generous money issuer in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to share ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, totaling $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union written by economic experts from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a panel of experts here.
(The World Bank says that 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the subsistence limit in 2005.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the trade fair for the first time together with the brand’s Russian dealer, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“The women are all well cared for and the men are all worth a fortune.”
As they move through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, refer to themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and I try to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to target it primarily to the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to spend several hours in traffic jams to visit a fast-moving warehouse that tastelessly side-by-side Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically sat at a booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
“Of course, Russians are more interested in climbers.”
In fact, traders here say that with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards), the Russians have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited numbers that would not market themselves at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, were pushing through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company had sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars to customer requirements, said he had sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the same linked chain bracelets, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-replacement.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife’s face from cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on these wheels,” said Mr. Karapetian.
“He’ll keep it in his 30 or 40 car garage.”
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaires” would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red phone cells stuffed with mountains of fake million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passersby stopped to throw the heaps of money around, mobile phone photos as they lean back in the middle of the spare wealth, let friends cut them, or just plug in a few million.
“See, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Surgery suspected in death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the big glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop at the white Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
“Then I saw the box wagon of the medical corpse attendant approaching,” Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, said on Wednesday.
“That was the point when I knew someone had died.”
The authorities learned that the dead Mrs. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who worked at the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations whose results may be unavailable for weeks will help clear up a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the Newark police leadership.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and persistent,” McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“She was my pitbull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the alcohol control commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical treatment.
"That's one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
“It’s an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro’s house, where a withered rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable, helping him find his way into the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
“She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing.”
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates lead to rise in global stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to soothe credit markets through further interest rate cuts were reinforced by appeasing comments from the U.S. central bank’s vice president.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said that politics must respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down frustrating markets, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had “partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October.”
Should the increased turbulence persist, it would increase the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments have been picked up by investors as a signal that the central bank is willing to intervene and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street, given more bad news from the U.S. economy, now that sales of U.S. real estate reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, announcing that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, in a cost reduction measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the U.S. mortgage loan sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader-based S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of UK standard values.
Germany’s index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for a three-month auction of European Central Bank guarantee funds granted to the European Commercial Banks at a considerable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and feed further capital into London’s money markets increased when credit tensions saw the three-month “Libor” rates for lending between UK banks rise to their highest level since late September, after a continuous increase since November 21.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who is going to beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral chairman, on call, at least under this particular title, is here to help head coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filling with applications for national electoral offices, if not for part-time ones.
Whoever does not get the sixth racket position will be unhappy, but life is often unjust and the sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to pin down exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of happiness instead of ability.
It’s not just in cricket where the choice is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to ascend?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can tell what the right class is for a cricketer, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decisions, but chances have it too.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain’s eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a racket must get regular odds on order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the chooser is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, for example, when James Anderson was apparently going to play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and like the wind is blowing in the nets.
Anderson took 32 world-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling to consolidate at the time, who made the breakthrough into a major test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred points against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion in the course of today’s network session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
Shah speaks for his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 world-class hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22, and an excellent record against twisted bullets.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the pickers as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his beating, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has shovel-like joy of life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket field and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently slammed a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone out (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he cones his middle pace with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to suit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time another.
Maybe that’s the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn’t mean Shah might not stand well if, as Ceylon’s tea set suggests, he’s the one to play here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work – and to Fight Al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose money or visas have run out, and others who hoped the city would return to normal.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
“I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now.”
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,” he said, referring to the Shia militias of militant clergyman Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to reset at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia helped drive Al Qaeda out of its bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had urged his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaida.
He had come back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. military increase and the growth of local “groups of affected citizens” who were armed and defending their neighborhoods in cooperation with the U.S. military.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and draining funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country's sectarian death squads.
“We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis not to give visas to force them to return to Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shia residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education do the Saarlanders press the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I explained to a non-Saharan for the 50th time yesterday that we are not French" - this slogan posts the smallest federal state self-ironically for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland’s education system, which ranks fifth in the education monitor of the Institute of German Economics Cologne (IW).
In this way, universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
But the children of the state also bring the Saarland to the universities in an above-average number - many of them without a degree in high school.
"In the Saarland you use the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at IW.
More than one in five young people acquires their degree at a vocational school, which means that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training has also been developed comparatively strongly.
Based on the population, equipping with dual degree programs is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by one third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms in general education schools," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
This is how the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last year of the kindergarten is free of charge - a model that now also other federal states copy.
Whether the performance of the students will improve sustainably will only be shown in future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the share of risk students shrank from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians think better.
And to the dismay of the Saarlanders foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area one could score otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbors is compulsory at high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez is changing the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will have the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to a new law, the clocks are set to world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that no other country in the world has.
The U.S. hostile Chavez justified his decision, among other things, by imposing the United States on the world the division into time zones to full hours.
Chavez also announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t do this alone because of my dignity,” said Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia on the release of hostages.
Uribe had “spucked Venezuela in the face” with his decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Chavez is also on everyone’s lips in Spain.
A new mobile phone ringtone is causing a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet.
Spain’s King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who was annoyed at the recent Ibero-American summit by the constant interludes of the left-wing populist and drove him over the mouth.
Germans Threatened to Pay Minus in 2007
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are predicted to lose real wages this year.
Experts cited a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees could expect less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price surges in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper.
Employees could also be burdened with unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of the unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is indeed right and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the food and petroleum price explosion was driving inflation to the highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the Earth's hellish twin
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind swirls on the poles, as they also occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided the evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "original soup theory", lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms in the ocean are said to have stimulated reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history,” says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.
"Venus may be the devil's twin of the Earth, but she's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the early 1990s no probe was specifically on the way to exploring this planet.
The latest research, which is now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underscores the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet to Earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa said.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud swirl at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits around the sun in just under 225 days.
But he turns much slower about himself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated that remained on Earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for her attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and has called on the big coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even though I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everybody knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but took Merkel into protection from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not refrained from traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from among the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, lamented the "showcase policy" of the Union in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership has not only invited the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries, according to information from SPIEGEL.
China’s Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the Tibetan religious leader in official function, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to separate Tibet and the further Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
“Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not unleash itself in violence on the street,” he said.
Barricades burned, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We have to make sure that social explosives do not build up and unload into violence.
We have to take this seriously,” he told the Hannover-based “Neue Presse”.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Federal government, states and municipalities were already working hard to alleviate problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this already shows first successes."
It is too early for warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs like in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris, youths had dealt heavy street battles with the police over the past nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
However, the German government’s greater integration efforts were demanded by the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as severe as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under the age of 25 is "over average".
Above all, more training places must be provided.
Kolat emphasized: “We need to give young people a perspective.”
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany, more than in France, "social control takes place in the families".
Many young people with a migrant background also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat exhorted: “But we still have to be careful.”
“Young people should be given the opportunity to participate quickly in work and training.”
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in action, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the day before, a supply of around 1000 security forces has ensured peace.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, around 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following eight, the riots attacked Toulouse.
The riots inflamed in a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The chancellor’s out-of-reality appearance documents that the coalition’s content is at an end – and that nothing more can be expected of her.
What country does this Chancellor live in?
After her desolate appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was sausage and low in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that should finally be ruled by it.
The accusation of her focusing too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with a very presumptuous sentence.
That was provincial, she said, and only showed that she didn’t want to understand what the critics were about.
In the Bundestag, it has clearly documented for everyone how much their accusation is true.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a relegated politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in danger even there.
Example of climate protection: It praises itself unrestrained for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate targets should be achieved in this country.
All in all, the self-loyalty - so much immodesty would have failed the CDU leader two years ago.
Now she clings to the flaws that the upswing is coming to people.
This damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of making the world beautiful.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and low-income worries?
She has a few side sentences left for it.
It is significant how often she promises herself when it comes to the child supplement.
Merkel needs three approaches to bring out a half-straight sentence.
It stumbles like on a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the Republican presidential candidates’ YouTube debate, two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, are making a hard-hitting exchange – and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already unleashed on the first topic.
He has made New York a “refugee for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
He, for his part, counters with serious accusations: “I would say his own house was a haven for illegals,” Giuliani replies, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their adversaries.
The self-made 30-second videos that internet users have submitted via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
“With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power,” John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets the levites vigorously read by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated, as torture.
However, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg in Florida show that the important topics of the campaign are beyond Iraq war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause burns in the auditorium.
This shows again where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney explains, pleading in front of base and television audiences for being one of the proponents of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, gets into a snare when he is asked his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civil for the first time
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus leaned on international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on November 3.
Soon after his swearing, Musharraf will, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus fulfill another demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied with lawyers weighed with him after the state of emergency in early November, had rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four more injured in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Krautrock are returning
Germany’s supergroup of the seventies is playing again: the three Harmonia band members performed their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a recording from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The enriched sensation then takes place in the form of three set gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has their boxes in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in a flower-white shirt at the age of 63 in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, concentrates on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally fits into a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
One can reveal here: Targeted questions revealed that the name, although swirling through the collective pop memory, was by no means so durable to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the German be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock has always been more important in England and America than in our own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for life’s work to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003, they saw in the hall questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the wonder knew no limits.
At concerts Michael Rother later popped on stage at the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the stranger is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also unfolded a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile in Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as city-volatile communes.
Less ideologically than in the Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
Rather in a quirky artist’s life.
Supposedly, there was also a whim of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some of Harmony kept it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
As calm and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered material distress.
Rice collecting was not just for self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record backdrop of almost 50 people, as someone thinks they remember.
From Rother came the desire to force Harmonia and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in esoteric spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Greenland’s record company has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as a German contribution to vibrant music.
It was excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in Berlin’s Haus der Kulturen der Welt.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
This would outline the entire range of influences of the krautrock on the subsequent pop music.
The space of the supergroup is filled in by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase floats with the most extraordinary sounds in the room: “The only true music, the future belongs to you.”
There are pictures showing the producers with Harmonia in the farmer's room.
The legend formation is used for projections of further black-and-white photos of wired equipment.
Before that, the three veterans were again involved in improvisation.
No longer by gluing microphones to the organ and drums to elicit unheard of sounds to the instruments via self-crafted effect devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technically inspiring tinkers.
The chorus of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, sound clouds are hoisted and whispered and sung in a beautiful spot with emphase "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music schools (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever calls ''68!' is not quite wrong, and Harmonia cannot be taken away from it even now.
The most obvious thing is thoroughly reconsidered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of your nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Killing Peace" again two films deal with the Balkan war.
But they both don’t convince.
Either the concepts place too much emphasis on action and ballerina or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere can't help in The Hunting Party.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, just there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nicely irrelevant roles in feel-good films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism drew a desire to look out.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes a Hunt" (Why do movie titles have to be as long and confused today as train driver tariff contracts?)
He provides a wonderfully eye-winkling representation: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of pleasure if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long past his very best times, but who himself has preserved considerable remains of the former charm as a ruin-like monument of his demise.
But despite this trumpet, “The Hunting Party” continues, together with the German production “Murderful Peace”, which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war movies.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from Kosovan hedgehog shooters, whereupon one immediately falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not represented here as the sole root of all evil, the television film is too quickly lost in balls and action.
It remains a kind of “alarm for Cobra 11” without a highway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be investigated by way of example, why there has never actually been a really good Balkan war movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters setting out to track down the Serbian upper war criminal "the fox" could have been a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and scriptwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are very similar: Both times small teams go into the forest to do something that the military cannot and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the outgoing cynic with a heart like he was introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to give him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, The Hunting Party goes down the drain when the reporters succeed in the last five minutes in the time-lapse process what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed in five years: catching the war criminals and leaving the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that you want to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against kinology.
The film has a profound human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to agree) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the good and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
In it it says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the poet: "Compassionately I see the swollen forehead veins, indicative of how strenuous it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly those swelling heads, but they indicate how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war movies.
It has recently been reported in this newspaper that all Iraq movies were Hollywood’s big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always, when a star drives around on the crises or minefields of the world, something comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts in time are just too close.
After all, decades had to go by before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust with Schindler’s List.
Some films are likely to mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated as masterpieces at that time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, even just too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the hesitation it takes to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really reigned.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcastically distant artistic outlook of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel Lemprière’s Dictionary and the Balkan War, he replied: “That’s only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be horribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrific way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust Reaps Criticism for Olympic Cancellation
The mayor’s withdrawal from Hamburg’s application for the Summer Olympics has been severely criticized by politics and business.
Many want to keep fighting for the games on the water.
But von Beust urges realism to assess opportunities.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive Officer of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described a waiver on Wednesday as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently unleashed as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sporting momentum would not be able to be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "starting from a changed timeline."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions are unrealistic at least by 2028.
“It’s not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic competition, but the German Olympic Sports Federation,” said Beust Welt Online.
He pointed to the decision of the Sportbund to apply for the 2018 Winter Games.
“This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic chances in the period until 2028 that we have planned so far.”
Nevertheless, the dream is not dreamed out for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This creates the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to take a chance by burying the plans already at this point," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the General German Higher Education Sports Association.
There, von Beust had described Hamburg’s application for the Universiade 2015 “not as a substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
“The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put Olympia on the map and excluded housing,” said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for an integrated planning for the Kleinen Grasbrook and a later use of housing, the CDU has unilaterally placed the "event factor".
At the time, the application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had sparked a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Those who combine the terms Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden throw dark shadows on Warhol's works directory.
A large part of the ninety-four "Stockholm-type" Brillo boxes listed there are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968 a few months ago, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to a sobering result: The six "Brillo boxes" that the former museum director Pontus Hultén donated to the Moderna Museet in 1995 as a gift to the around one hundred of the "Brillo's" are probably copies.
The prehistory is nestled, a confusing combination of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the soap powder "Brillo" cardboard boxes.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol’s consent, featured hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were not (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartonage factory.
They were not works of art, but their role models, they were mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes, which at that time were authorized as original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Type Stockholm" and rightly entered into the art and auction history.
Some of them made more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at Moderna Museet, has also examined three privately owned Brillo boxes, two of which were produced in Stockholm in 1968: their press plates were first primed and sanded, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the pressing plate with a painting roll without a primer - moreover, it is not oil paint but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," said Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet, "if the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced to pursue the “severe accusations” that are being raised in matters of soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, they have remained in relentless silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
Rebellious soldiers in the Philippines have given up entrenched in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot be held responsible for bloodshed, the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, told reporters in the hotel.
Governmentally loyal soldiers had stormed the hotel previously under tear gas use.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
Around half of them were tried on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillane.
He took advantage of the trial to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers, who were supposed to guard him, apparently ran over to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces blocked the district around the noble hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main venue for the attempted mutiny of about 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after nearly 24 hours because the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
You now hold 20.05 percent of the share capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
The option is open to increase the share of sates.
The move is intended to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, presumptions had already arisen about an entry, after Berenberg Bank has increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considers the shares to be only a third party, it said in the financial market.
The previous day, United Internet had already participated in the mobile company Drillisch with just under 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started discussions about marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” said a United Internet spokesman.
The two companies have established the joint venture MSP to acquire the competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a good ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right to take over an additional 18.49 percent stake in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG, it said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has been going on for months and is still difficult to see, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full line customers by the end of the third quarter.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch held 6.01 percent of the freenet shares so far.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another 4%.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
