The romantic shooting can be found in the video:
DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
“That’s a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other in the way that is set out in his statement,” Grindel said in the football podcast “Phrasenmäher” of the “Bild-Zeitung”.
Despite the months-long debate over the photos of Ozil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time national player Ozil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed until a certain point that this would be the case,” Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and justified it also by the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn’t want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so well that when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I find it a pity that this conversation hasn’t come about so far.”
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 14:13, the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade left and found the cabin in full fire upon arrival.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire debris to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery for charging at lunchtime.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What has led Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has himself streamed live as she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and published a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Happy Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accused adults of child trafficking.
There is no evidence for all of this in the clip.
“The whole world is seeing this right now,” Lohan says in the video as she continues to track the family down the street.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses a bow.
With tears, the actress insists on how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What moved Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The probe "Hayabusa2" launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated into the devastated and isolated areas of the outside world.
Elon Musk Resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chairman
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused turmoil in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal from the electric car maker.
The U.S. stock market regulator sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he can remain chairman.
Congress of British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the party congress of the Tories
Birmingham is the stage of a power struggle.
The congress is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the front of former Secretary of State Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name duplications for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and that is what the population is voting on this Sunday - are you doing well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” presents itself as an anti-system candidate and is thus in the forefront of the polls.
His strongest rival is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers’ Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" work-up takes longer than planned
“The diesel task force still exists,” said Peter Mertens, Development Board member, to the industry magazine “Automobilwoche”.
In December 2017, Rupert Stadler, CEO of Audi, announced that the task force would be dissolved soon.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gearbox combinations are expected to be tested,” he said at the time.
Mertens said: “At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in working out the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi’s mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "grave organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi boss of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after the exhaust gas fraud became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot currently heads the company as commissioned CEO.
Due to the change to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Schot told the "Heilbronner Stimme".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Schot focuses on electric mobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already has 15,000 reservations.
Grindel aims for re-election - Lahm should be in the DFB-presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for DFB again next year, despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Ozil affair.
“I do my job and try to do it as well as I can,” Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning in the ZDF’s “Current Sports Studio”.
You always have to make a re-election, that’s what I’ll do.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "have a pleasure to work on the future project" after the award for the 2024 European Football Championship.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown over the summer fairy tale affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Presidium.
"I would be happy if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise on this role in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, would be cordially invited to make his experience available in sporting matters," said Grindel.
In speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed a wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone without a migration background has a significant impact on society and football and says, ‘the issue is important, we have to take care of it’, that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local clubs where integration must work,” Grindel said.
Lose weight correctly with semi-smart scales
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but that is more for the sausages.
He doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscles.
Basketball Bundesliga: clear opening success for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the basketball league.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 Scores) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators in his compulsory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won coach Ainars Bagatskis’ debut with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was with 24 points the best pitcher among the guests.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 scoring points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the best shooter in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a significant success.
In the basketball lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings outperformed the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweiger, in which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdogan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdogan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdogan urged the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm our German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the Cologne city center had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were in action, including snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is criticized for being considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Terrifying Second
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in New York’s Central Park.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on the night of Sunday in front of about 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I’m nervous, I sweat, but it’s okay because I’m here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a second of terror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shot, became afraid and tried to escape.
There was panic and people ran away.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people from the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Whoever wanted to get one, had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was cheer and applause from the audience - but buhrufe on the other hand for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke on stage with his democratic colleague Chris Coons for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the Justice Committee of the U.S. Senate for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and thus pushed many women before their heads.
At least three women have filed allegations of abuse, including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which Kavanaugh rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women, who claimed to have experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also come together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake said at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends the release of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the release of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The t-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told Bild on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has created a major unrest, which is unacceptable.
That is why he ordered people protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in jail in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blamed the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not sure about the Turkish authorities: Only at the beginning of September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Most recently, the cases of detained journalists Mezale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for wet-joyful talks at the bar of the Hamburg port pub "Schellfischposten".
Presenter Ina Müller and her guests come up with some beer, some wine or even high-percent drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Many celebrities also take courage for the obligatory singing deposits.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time around: The actor Florian David Fitz known from movies like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Horniest Day".
But the Munich man did not get a good trip to the high north.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some – probably not quite serious – insights that he has now gained: “Rule one: NEVER go to Ina’s night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round egg liqueur that Ina throws at half past three also leaves out.
Alcohol consumption is really written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftershocks.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - presumably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the usually attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nightly squeeze is not yet known.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and rubbish
The entry into the 36-kilometre long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood Country in Treysa presents itself as difficult to find and wasted.
Recipes against grass-roots vandalism are sought, but solutions are scarcely noticeable.
Scraps, cigarette tipping, garbage and rubbish, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entry with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship railway bike path in Rotkäppchenland a more than infamous sight.
The topic has employed members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Cycling Advisory Board.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also included the topic in the local council.
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and local residents - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebration on weekends.
Not only does it often happen loudly, the pillows are also destroyed: poles are torn from the ground, trash cans are demolished, signs are bent over, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the resting place at the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for storage.
"The focus here is clearly on the Haaße Hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the Cycling Commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is opening today.
“If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive.”
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this sets the threshold for grabbing common property significantly higher.
However, this would require a police raid to come by in a timely manner.
Basically, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycle path so far one can be very satisfied.
The tourism market is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany," the ADFC members said.
As an extremely critical hazard, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Asheroder Straße in Treysa.
There is no turn-off trail on the Hate Hill.
In the case of busy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides,” she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for a music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup District Offensive, in the "Music Contest for Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the cultural railway station.
Seven formations began, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Hemig, a long-lived albathene, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally the Weiessland.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other districts.
What were the lyrics associated with?
At the places, the Hiltruper lake and the market avenue were mentioned particularly frequently.
Rolf Hemig chose the avenue in his camper-like song to be the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also appreciated.
Time and again it was about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or clues about her work.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
The sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann knew Franke to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all sorts of things on Youtube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury’s favorites – so that others could also listen to their songs.
A whole CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup beater, which impressed Franke particularly with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tolle.
Like everyone else, the children reappeared for the finale – and sounded “really good” even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury consisted of Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Business Association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event to be a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very crowded cultural railway station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
There is a screen for each side, containing four cards with keywords that you can only decipher - the old trick with the red slide - after you have inserted it in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read by mistake.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Dice.
4th party."
These are the terms that need to be encrypted.
It is not the terms that should be guessed, but the codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encryptor.
He'll get a code card that might have "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes should be guessed.
His task in this case: to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "feast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and, if possible, the opposing team does not; because the game wins if he manages to crack the code twice.
The encryptor therefore notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "Loose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he has been attentive at school and knows the window fall there.
So it goes round for round, team for team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposite side, it can be better combined with every hint that the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, the descriptions should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rulebook.
Players will probably have to study it for quite a long time before they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But those who have started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever is just about guessing and not winning points, can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows Hitler greeting police and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspection twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hitler salute in the Upper City of a passing police force, then later he also noticed in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he failed to comply with the police’s mandate, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspectorate in the prison cell.
In the sober state, he must then also be liable for the use of marks of unconstitutional organizations.
Company Pressig was home to the drawers
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit, you heard it in the press," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
It didn't get anyone upset.
The brakes also quieted and the wagons crawled.
It was pure railroad.
Statements that symbolically represent Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain range to the north, which has its peak point in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres.
To cope with this, train and drawer locomotives, which had their home in Pressig, were needed in the past.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway operating workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, driving management and railway mastery.
"The centerpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a renovation in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and 47 years of professional railway workers.
From the Bamberg railway plant (BW) Pressig, which was commissioned in 1968, locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - North Half were also operated.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for train and drawer locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used on freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weights were still ranked per month.
In 1982, parts of the factory were demolished, and in 1991 the rest were demolished.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that we have not envisaged a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport."
Even at Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here,” recalls Georg Dinkel.
Soon after that.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig Rangierbahnhof was history.
"The rangers and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any failure would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber opens with success at China Open
Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have already reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing, as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the third world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian woman placed at number 13 gave up.
The Schwäbin is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment", a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A big visitor’s welcome showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.
House owner Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He has been there since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good future prospects.
Both have been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have contributed to the design of flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is again a 70-cent special postage stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high attendance of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical frame.
As the visitor walks through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear that the title "wind game performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor awaits on the right side of the "Happy Tree" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in color, playfully equipped with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bush in the background, the object looks fairy-tale and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to devote herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Halfway away, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "wind game performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50th Anniversary of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers Celebrate 50th Anniversary
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians at that time also made air for their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept partout that there should be no more singing life in the district after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia".
It has now become a legend: at a bench in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
The anniversary was celebrated at the "House of Meeting".
“It will be full today,” said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
It was a tradition for years, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball became it, for festive clothing had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows as usual in the "House of Meeting", but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was in demand: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albanians themselves sounded the voice.
For the occasion there were happy songs.
As I said, “A day as beautiful as it is today.”
Suitable for the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hope".
Again, the choral direction was sovereign by Richard Homann, who was one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "he's got such an easy way, it's a masterpiece he's doing." By the way, this time not only men were presenting themselves singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big tombola.
The proceeds are intended to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Center.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring finds itself quite well in league three.
No trace of shyness or fracking, the independents are doing their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we've already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer the mood was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it to the goal, such a game can be tipped," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
“We all know who’s on the other side of such a derby.
It doesn't break our necks.
I have seen really good volleyball in phases," Annacker didn't argue with the 0-3 - and went on to the agenda immediately.
Where the trip goes for the independents seems unforeseen after just three days of play.
“It’s just too early for that,” says Axel Büring.
He said: “The third league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball." In the fourth league they do not want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not polluted in the next few weeks, you have to look up.
A first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee starts in Essen on October 14.

On her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly talks about the fact that the series may have had a part in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Host Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left for good.
The series that made her a star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues I admired noticed me at eye level,” Keller tells the “Bild am Sonntag”.
At first, she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so much, I don't know."
She thinks it’s possible that her husband at the time might have been quite envious, but “as many men, Hans also shunned conversations about problems and feelings.”
Keller had always tried to be the only right one for Hans von Borsody and he didn’t want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I’ve shifted,” she explains further.
She always felt like she wasn’t good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman I never really was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I was sitting in the wardrobe crying and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why has it never worked out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I was too naive about love.”
The night moth, which regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ-Resort Zürich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the shining glow into which a green carpet is dipped in the hexagonal square blinds him too much.
But it is a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening he twists over the square to make himself easy in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the emergency facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, in the men's oasis, for some reason, it stinks to heaven.
So get out of here, go over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" in the cinema next door at the best level, celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store as every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as we know, the works shown come from all over the world.
What you don’t have to think about in an article about this festival, so as not to fall into sluggish advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly binds a ribbon around the sensors, which has a good fairy attached to it, and two bully doormen actually wave him generously in.
Inside, the invited crowds dance to live music far after midnight or let DJ rhythms make them scream at each other, and rinse up exquisite bits with Cüpli.
In the delicacies shop in the basement, oysters are waiting for swallowing mouths, next door, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: all the shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleaned up for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for that!
The moth studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If that were two separate instructions, he was wrong in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly already saved lives.
In the upstairs household goods department, the poultry tip a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not compulsory for this mix that a capsule manufacturer presents itself with.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting that brand for years, isn’t here that night either.
There, however, a face that seems familiar to the observer passes between local celebrity, cash desk and kitchen items: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character may not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, almost like a choir boy, with almost sixty.
It is not touched, it is not touched, it is kept secret at the most.
Especially for this restraint, which is often misunderstood as jamming, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dance
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona is pleased with the victory of his team.
Argentina’s football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 win from his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the cabin, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In a team member’s 15-second clip, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fueled by the players.
The Mexican second-ligist defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera “Always with my boys, always.”
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Sending after last minute plea "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destroyed" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - failure - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - over long phases, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we totally slept," the ASV coach got annoyed.
The landlords quickly ran with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not initially bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the backlog was only two goals.
Above all, sending Best, Marius Hintze, hit another time in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor’s point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst scored 15:15, after which the season changer ran almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then?
The impartial intervene.
Bieletzki usually avoids blaming others.
But: The 120-second time penalty Steffen Mühlhoff confiscated “was a joke.”
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well against seven men in the back and repeatedly threw them to the empty goal.
You can only buy little for the compliments.
"Now must be a damn victory," said Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Higher (1).
Bavaria: Woman has been missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (county courtyard), the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday, troops dug up a street at Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers underneath were removed, as the police and the prosecution jointly communicated.
According to new findings, the missing person may have been buried not far from their former home.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working intensively on the case together with the Prosecutor’s Office.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Heritage Agency, the investigators met with a ground radar at Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the site to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an out-of-court lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk also resigns as Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He is allowed to remain head of the board.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the U.S. federal court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, who is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not guilty.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market, paying $420 per share, the funding being secured.
Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla stays on the stock market.
After the deal, Tesla must now find an external chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.

46% don’t want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
After the turmoil of the past few weeks, the GroKo collects several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey – Angela Merkel is seen critically.
The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one counter to 17 percent, the SPD scores one point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and reach only 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If parliamentary elections were to take place on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
With this, the big coalition has lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes – with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag elections, they received 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, the second largest party in several surveys, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens have a share of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left averages 10 percent, while the FDP averages 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the percentage of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also decreased significantly since the 2017 Bundestag elections.
At present, only 48 percent of citizens believe that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
Only one in two (50 percent) currently wishes that the big coalition will hold until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also showed a significant drop in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also judge whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent voted in favour, 44 percent opposed.
64% of EU supporters would like to be nominated, 35% would not.
Hangout at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic get-together stories - he should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket exudes almost an anachronistic romance as a place to get to know the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargain at the wohl table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less of a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react if you don’t talk around the hot porridge for long in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
The real Hollywood Lovestory potential is when love happiness is preceded by an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-recovered plot.
If the guy still contacts his worshippers at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch.gmx.de, then that sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in an Aldi store unknown to us to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic pune meat".
For the belief in the magic of analogue getting to know her, she definitely deserves her happy ending s la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been participating in the action "Covers against polio - 500 covers for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease referred to in German as polio leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered to be eradicated, but there are still three countries in which the disease occurs.
So far, the cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be curbed by vaccinations, according to a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for peace for Götze
Leverkusen (AP) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to Mario Götze's public discussion on form and fitness.
“We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn’t do us any good,” said the friend of Götze Reus after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen on the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
This is not an easy situation for him personally.
Football: Eberl: No haste at contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the football league Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no rush in a possible extension of the contract with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a treaty yet.
There is no fixed date when we do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky on Sunday.
Football: District League: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard in court with his.
Wortkarg he gave himself, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first retired (innerly) to think about the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
It's all history.
In the meantime, it is running around the Brandhoveweg again.
The 1-1 mark on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the last season only blazingly scrapped past the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the show.
“We tightened the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked for each individual to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly to a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes was waiting in front for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more stakes in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his Aus (17th), the interchangeable Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
That almost took revenge when the SCA hit the Wolbeck box twice in person with Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer in minute 41 - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed barely.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, fetish on the left again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheine Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the runners 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The offender himself stepped in and demonstrated his dangerousness to standards.
Westhues' right-slap thing hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes left, which would be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unfortunately flew the leather to the hand in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final stage, before Geske in the 87th minute from twelve meters still had the victory goal on the pitch.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting point: Four points after five days of play - that could not be enough coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home win.
Stürmer Ante Rebic, who first stood in the starting eleven after an injury, should help with this.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, there was an accident on the airfield.
The four inmates were easily injured.
Around 2 p.m. a drama occurred on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
The landing of a helicopter caused turbulence, the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was caught by a gust of wind, squeezed to the ground and stopped laterally.
Immediately the police, rescue and fire departments were informed.
With a big bid, the troops came to the accident site.
For caution, the ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and could go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigation.
According to fire department spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small creation fire, which, however, could be quickly erased again.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female at the deadline of 1 September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which was officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Stiftungs-Geschäftsführer Wiebke Ankersen.
In the US, UK or Sweden, purely male leadership teams – with few exceptions – are no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking in comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the share of women among the German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses among the companies of the medium-sized index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8% of the board members are female.
Last year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Lastly, 26 women worked on boards.
“I’m sure the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women in the coming year – in their own interest,” Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to make a commitment to increase the share of “zero percent” so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 men less than a year ago.
“If you recruited as many women per year for the boards of directors, by 2023 you would have reached a percentage of 40 percent,” the report said.
Some even make mischievous: luxury cargoes: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros of operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This question was addressed by "Autopapst" and business professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made 69,000 euros in operating profit with each car sold, while Jaguar Land Rover only makes around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put heavily on it with each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of on average 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torch train for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
With a torch train, the Tourism Association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which from now on rise every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on the Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the jubilee, the people responsible moved through the place to the festival place under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn.
In the already splendid festival tent, the chairman of the Tourism Association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "60 years of doing something like this - this is an insane achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later symbolically approached the guests from the stage.
"Happy that so many have found their way back to us after the Abtswind".
On Sunday, on which the abbotswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had set the drink prices on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before it goes into the second round one day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: Emergency car power in taxi
An emergency car is badly damaged next to a road.
In a collision with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - preferably even save lives.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end to a 26-year-old in Bonn.
A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in a collision of an emergency car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and her driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had crossed a red traffic light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then met at a crossroads with the taxi that drove at Green.
The doctor's car hurled against a traffic light pole and a tree after the collision.
He captured the passer-by who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency services.
The 29-year-old nurse, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency doctor tried to do this, but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor's office, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the disgraceful exit in the League Cup, Manchester United now also loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The way of defeat is still to be talked about.
Symbolically, the scene was in the 74th minute, when the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot the 3-1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel’s pass, all Manchester defensive players stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously insufficient performance over long distances.
At present, the mood at United’s rival Manchester City is quite different.
The citizens trained by Mourinho’s great competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion for a reckless 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider’s bar for the first time for the home team.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former scorer, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool is no longer a table leader
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1-1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Just like in the cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The goal of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, barely missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his locker.
After the Reds had started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea could not be beaten for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp’s team in the Cup, and now the Blues Liverpool have plunged from the top of the table due to the draw in the league.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2:0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success message against the surprise team from County Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unfortunately brought Alex Iwobi to his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season goal.
Thanks to the fifth consecutive victory, Arsenal passed Watford and is now in 5th place immediately behind the big rival Tottenham.
The Wolves remained undefeated at 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and occupy 8th place.
VW’s key brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no issue and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies go even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the Automobile Show 2018, they will be showcasing their innovations in the French capital from next week together with the competition from all over the world.
Diesel doesn’t really matter anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, should still be an important topic at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have among other things their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstädter is to be launched on the market by the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
BMW’s iNext is expected to start in 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were over a million visitors.
At least 380 people have died in the severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was hit by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communication and transport connections have been damaged, and there has been enormous damage to property.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the coastal town of Palu.
It is feared that the number of victims will increase significantly.
So far, the numbers have only come from Palu.
However, numerous other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcyclist pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle worship (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at Haus Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by bikers in the Peace Church in Eveking.
About 150 bikers gathered there on Sunday to perform anything but ordinary worship.
Already from 10 a.m. the Bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker-early kicks were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the biker worship of pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The song was written by the singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill makes rather poetic-quiet tones," says pastor Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big party: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice to his astonishing spectators.
Every now and then Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and had them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could have imagined how it would turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the chopped apple pieces layer by layer.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had ready-bottled specialties with him.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the latest feather whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorf camaraderie of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
Also next year, the home club will offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: eventually it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth-season lead: "Scheissene Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 professionals around him and gave them courage.
However, many positives were not seen before in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The defeatless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met, are at the bottom with two counters and are a candidate for descent in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated the first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored in front of 46,300 spectators the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general rehearsal for the European League match against Lazio Rome, scored seven points in the midfield.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive by the Hessians during his start-elf debut and never got to grips with Hanover's defenses.
The striker, long after the World Cup, showed with his pace and perseverance why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was borrowed from FC Liverpool, was also for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, which began swinging.
Lucas Torró's (17th) headball, which was falsified on the goal net, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defensive corner, Haller prolonged his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to keep her foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender who came in the summer from the French second-ligist AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt was still going ahead of the break.
This time, Haller matched up with his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully refueled and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the half-time, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak idea of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony played a bit more courageously forward, but ignition ideas remained until just before the end, when at least the follow-up hit succeeded.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After about an hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed it across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show running for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests, even Jovic hit one minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter made it before millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Munich meadow in the last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geisingen Christians celebrate Holy Cross
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross on the 14th of September or the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shot Christ, who is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier during the 30-year war.
Then blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The church service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geising parish.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the festival ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish hall.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish, informed visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been standing for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more has been determined, which was only made possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The base plastering work is complete, the natural stone work is to be started before winter and it is hoped to be able to complete well over half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" is now handed over to its destination - all those present at the inauguration date agreed.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have already lived in the residence of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put to the test for the residents with Handycap: "The house had come into the years and no longer in the equipment," Bader said.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Around 4.6 million euros were invested in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to the architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both temporally and financially.
He was also thanked for this by the Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The balance between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the residents to experience the freedom to move without the help of others.
Similarly, the head of the Social Administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile".
The homeliness and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this location is a real good luck, because in today's situation it can no longer be purchased".
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers space for almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe CEO Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by tariff.
Germany: Schwesig complains of differences between East and West
Before the Day of Unity, Deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig has appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences,” said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer on average than the people in West Germany, but would get 15 percent less salary.
“I can’t explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after German unity,” Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does This Cute Dog End the Korean Conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is said to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon’s office announced on Sunday, the two about a year old dogs already reached their recipient on Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to "facilitate" the animals.
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
It is part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria’s Moving History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
On the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this memorial year, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
This is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition that begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not lastly summon the "return to work in the field" mantra-like.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and material work, but be it.
Now that the Federal Government is ready to devote itself again to its mission - to governing - it should not be deterred from doing so with conceptual debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blamages of the past weeks will probably already be shown Monday.
In the evening, the heads of the ruling parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all this dispute.
First of all, however, the diesel retrofits and the Immigration Act again put conflicting issues on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to make the car companies with exchange premiums smoothly get away, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has seen an rapprochement over the weekend, Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned skilled workers immigration law.
The SPD calls for a prospect of staying for rejected asylum seekers who work or do an education.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "track change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners – and how should it be different?
Not Gleich und Gleich has joined forces with GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social views and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without a dispute, a society so diverse and sometimes conflicting in interests does not move forward.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be raised again on the question of being or not being for party tactical reasons.
It’s still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD should argue – but always have an eye on the reality of people’s lives.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
This guiding question can be used to pragmatically clarify both the diesel and the lane change question - and thus regain trust.
That is why the parties have to fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in sight
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
“Really day and night,” her legists would have worked on the social security reform, a exuberant social minister reported at the presentation two weeks ago.
For list mushroom mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) comes as a surprise - she is now bringing the matter to parliament via inquiry.
She assumes that the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and by no means to announce violations of applicable civil service law in front of ongoing cameras.
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to be able to "absolve Har tinger of any suspicion".
Police tore a street in search of female corpse
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, Steben has been dug on the state road between Naila and Bad.
The line is closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday.
The investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able, together with his guide, to limit the relevant site to a few meters during repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian heritage protection authority in the area of the said piece of road.
For more than a year now, the public prosecutor and the criminal police court have been handling the case of the missing person.
Time and again, a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar equipment, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been obscured here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Color powders and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is celebrated for the first time.
But before that, there are riots.
The separatists did not forget the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police have taken place in the centre of Barcelona.
Among other things, Catalan security forces were attacked with color powder by the proponents of independence as they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the police units Policia Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues, who were in the polls last year at the referendum that was classified as illegal.
Attempting to prevent citizens from voting had also resulted in violence at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the around 6,000 separatists then tried to break the police chain by force, and threw the officials with color bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people have been arrested, 24 others have been slightly injured, it said, citing the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in U-arrest.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered cluelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split torless
Red-and-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only a 0-0 draw.
The final light and the third last, they turned out to be assembled in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion.
The first half was poorly manageable by the entertainment factor.
Those who would rather get a beer or a roast sausage could do so without worries.
There was no risk of missing a torchance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game, Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible in the 28th minute.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle the only real - opportunity, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area border.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel was aiming just over the case from 18 meters and after an hour, the Güterslohers also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
The swiftly presented counter about Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a sluggish shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also scored with a headball from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from former athlete Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It wasn’t until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it didn’t make a difference either.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played at zero". But unfortunately, the zero was also ahead.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "everything broke up a bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
“I didn’t feel like we could get a goal,” Daut said.
However, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder board issuing office, for whom these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: “These donations will remain in Reckenfeld.”
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the space was still a little empty, but that was supposed to change during the day.
“It’s so nice here, that’s why we’re here today,” one visitor said.
Organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent touch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, which was supposed to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creimers.
And the "replacement" was not to be taken away from entertaining the ever-increasing visitors musically in between.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many active people with their stands, including mainly clubs.
"Actually, there should not be such a thing as a table," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all who were in use at the stands and included the other festivals that took place in September and the "clean up" action.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful paint - here goes something.
Then the coronation of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was removed with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarter.
Many stalls have been worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was there.
Stefan Hagmeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decoupier saw.
Furnishings, beer lids with rack fields motifs and much more he had on offer.
A specialty offered three rack fields beekeepers: "Reckfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrication with a local political message: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknowns have advertised the construction of a skate facility in a way that is hardly conducive.
There are corresponding lubrications in several places, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been charged with property damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were written on signs, among others at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the trade fair on 19 September a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro had been discovered.
Since the short message at that time was apparently "only" left with an Edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, it was there again, this time sprayed," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case gets a special touch because several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate system is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
Commitments already exist, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of school, sport and culture, without mentioning a name.
However, it is quite possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
Local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding for years.
After the old one at the LWL clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
In the end, the council voted in favour of the fire department parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turnaround followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says on the state of the art that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word is the city council.
He assumes a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Air traffic congestion is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of an improvement in the coming year.
“This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm comes,” said the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick solution.
“Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years,” the trade unionist said.
Europe-wide, the market for fully trained pilots is empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticized the fact that several aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city on Friday, representatives of the federal government, the states, air traffic control, airlines and airports come together to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, it will not work without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members in the German air traffic control system.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission’s guidelines for the Lotsen mice.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting costs and personnel savings in the national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operating business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not further constrict air traffic controls".
Currently, the EU regulations will be voted on by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure on the part of the airlines.
“Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years,” Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs in the airlines initiated a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", Maas said.
The so far announced admission of 120 pilot students annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet associated with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Group Reconstruction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans for the restructuring of the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies should be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be an additional staff reduction beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control panel on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be made at a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business with elevators and supplies is to be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence in demos of police officers and Catalan independence advocates.
During two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous wounded.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence protesters.
The Catalan police have tried with a big bid to keep the two protests away from each other.
According to the armed forces, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and shotguns.
According to the reports, there were also rankings between the participants of the various protests.
Rescue workers said 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who took action almost exactly one year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
“Why did they come here to protest?” asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they threw us down a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
“Of course, we want to support our comrades, who only did their duty last year: to defend the law,” he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
“He and his colleagues did not come to provoke,” the police said.
Pane allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A vulnerability in a mobile app has resulted in the personal data of ministers and deputies of the conservative British Tory party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the breakdown was announced a day before the Tory Party in Birmingham.

Football: Juve coach praises Ronaldo's best match
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best game this evening along with the half-hour of Valencia," Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) victory against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star was the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and does well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and we have grown from that moment on.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goalscorers, Juve turned the game after the early lag due to the score of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and for the time being hanged the worst pursuer.
The goalkeeper picked up by Real Madrid initially put on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took care of the lead with a double pack (26/49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by headball, also did the preparatory work for the goal of defensive boss Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who just had to push in before the goal line.
“He has a lot of templates,” the coach praised.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
“We need to get even better at serving him,” the coach said.
Best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With Ronaldo’s purchase for more than 100 million euros, Juventus’ overpowering power seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six points ahead of Naples.
The second table, which was trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the placement of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to get off the pitch after too hard kicking in against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples," said the Turin coach.
Emre Can also felt that way.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
The professional from FC Liverpool was in use in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown from the pitch at the 2-0 victory of the Turiner and is closed for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West has changed his name.
With a particularly whimsical appearance, rapper Kanye West has given attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you can only call him “Yes,” as the musician says.
"The creature that used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he took his artist name.
The pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "yes" had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," the rapper said.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
succeeded!
Hoetmar’s coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
It was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more handy, we have almost never faced any problems."
Grade two goal chances in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle for early guidance (7th).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after great pre-work by Krause, he altered standing free.
The hosts only had a double possibility when Moritz Höne initially failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forgave.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use it for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball over the line was the game decided (81).
“We had previously criticized ourselves harshly, which was different today than in the last weeks,” said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spektakelfußball in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to say,” he rang after words.
"We didn't have access to them at all," he said, referring to the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also to all the other green-whites who stood out with collective offensive urges.
He was able to laugh anyway: "A dirty victory," he said, winked cheeky and moved from his players, however, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Note, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely albatrosses, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the preservation of the class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
“That was by far our best season performance,” he says.
"How we come back after the 2-0, how we've been against one of the league's top teams for the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
All the more bitter it is that you now have to go home with empty hands.
Top goalkeeper Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season goal (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He played the 2-0 for Fabian Föhning (39.) on the left.
We knew that, but you can’t completely eliminate such a player.
"That was already madness, what he did," Lewandowski enviously acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the side change, his own eleven made the balance: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long toreck (45th).
After the change of side, it was McGill again who scored the balance (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann competed (69th).
Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
“The game against Schapdetten, that’s what we have to win now,” Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the national league duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0-0.
Media: Resignation of the entire Executive Board of Dynamo Dresden
According to media reports, the entire management of football second league player Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media outlets in the evening concurred on a joint letter from the Sachsen Board.
At first there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Celebrities and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 conferences by mid-next year.
Meanwhile, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to personally pick up the tolerance prize in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn calculated him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us".
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker attends a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, and on September 29, the writer Frido Mann attends a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged that he will personally receive the “Tolerance Prize” awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 conferences until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
“Retirement isn’t safe!” is the title of a conference.
“SOS on Europe’s borders” – this is how the Academy describes the “risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean.”
And to a meeting on Syria: “barbarism without limit.”
Weapon deals, destruction, torture, death – war mocks every humane idea.”
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the scissors between the poor and the rich to the radical change in work through digitization.
Academy Director Hahn said: “A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions.”
At a meeting of 200.
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits one more visitor to the direction of capitalism criticism, the other a tendency "from left to center".
What about neutrality?
“We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church,” said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, “so we are not 100 percent neutral.”
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner presented himself with gender understanding, not only with humor and heartwarming for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and what else might exist, but also with music.
The mini guitar used her and also mastered her violin.
On the wing was Ben Süverkrüp.
He is on the one hand the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks up to the end of the sentence, and on the other hand a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies that some may have wanted a solo.
This was also the case with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, in the way it fit the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had come up with a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have arisen from Mozart’s composition if “The Nannerl” had opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrüp slides in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's g minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Blumen handed over Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, to the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo one in Wolbeck in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain CEO of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, but has to give up the chairmanship of the board.
Musk also agreed with the US SEC to pay a double-digit million-dollar fine, the SEC said.
The background is Musk’s surprising August announcement that he wants to take Tesla off the stock market.
The SEC accused Musk of providing false and misleading information.

10 passengers were easily injured instead of 15 passengers.
Everyone has been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night for observation.

Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems especially with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone scored ten goals.
“Actually, I was very happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We have not gotten to grips with them,” says ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
The focus in the finale made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore almost lagged behind until the end, lagging behind at 11:12 for the break and later at 15:18 (45th).
It was only towards the end that the broader bank of the hostesses became noticeable decisively.
In addition, Aydogdu put backroom Merle Klement on the left, who then "extremely cleverly made the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top match at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
In the second-liga drop-off VC Allbau Essen, the Blau-Weißen won 3-1.
“It was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked out that,” coach Dominik Münch was pleased after an almost impeccable performance of his team with the overthrown leader.
The first round dominated the guests almost at will.
About 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-champion of the previous year.
Food was accepted in the double bar, but did not come into play.
We've got them busy.
Our opponent opened up with high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has switched the acceptance to three-bars.
We couldn't keep up the pressure.
Food has sucked away, and we’ve let ourselves go a little bit,” Münch continued.
At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had their noses in front for the first time.
Although Ostbevern withdrew four sets of balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the instructor said to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the hand in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played there consistently and quietly."
About 7:3 and 15:13 the Blue and White Passage brought four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
Turkish Community: Mosque Opening as Missed Opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the inauguration of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
“The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left behind a heap of shards in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be cumbersomely brought together,” said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides missed the opportunity for a mutual, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of side by side with German top politicians to emphasize the Muslims' affiliation with Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The extensive exclusion of the German public has "confirmed many reservations".
Home Club Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it’s finally Folktreff time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the home association Nottuln is already hosting its fifth Nottuln folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
It was almost a year ago that we performed a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn’t have thought that our folk reunion would blossom so fast in Nottuln eta.
Whether it was a storm depth Friederike in January or a heat wave in July, the fireplace room of Amtmannei was always full.
"As always, the program at the next folk meeting is a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old Schlagern," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites fellow musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has pledged his accordion for the first folk hit "birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, which played music with flat German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff are happy to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten inspired the audience with his international version of the song "Froschen in der Nacht" and sent home with an earworm.
“We expect a lot of happy guests to spend a social and humorous evening once again,” says the home club’s invitation.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is advisable to be there in good time.
The folk meeting starts at 7:30 p.m., but admission is already at 7:00 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by October 24.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step towards becoming the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde said on Sunday.
As a result, the multi-billion-dollar merger is still subject to approvals in South Korea and – as the biggest hurdle – in the US.
Most recently, the chances of obtaining an approval there had improved, according to an insider, because Linde has promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by October 24th in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus set the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbacher, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
At the time, however, he was still called a different name: as the "District Obstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land", he was raised by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit-growing, nobody thought about flowers and horticulture at the time.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained district nurse Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees should line highways, so-called industrial gardens have been created in schools.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, organic plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the conveyance of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Molwürfe" showed on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said Krei chairman Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm emphasized how important nature experiences are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with your smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, the district association decides," added Landrat Söllner, highlighting the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district, left no doubt about this even district managing director and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He guided the many visitors with a pictorial lecture through the long history of the Circle Association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was doped in.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has survived, it was there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the fruit and walnut tree specialist argued.
Therefore, there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to give up, so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added the president of the Bavarian state association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the music association Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta Talks: Canada’s Foreign Minister Moves UN Speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity on Nafta: They are setting an ultimatum for an agreement between the two trading partners.
Canada’s foreign minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority – and postpones her speech before the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will only speak before the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she focuses on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States had 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the United States.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Discussions about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be brought to a conclusion, Trump’s government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico’s President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the last week before the presidential election in the South American country.
The politician had been attacked on the open road at the beginning of September during an election event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele n'o" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
On social networks, too, the associations against Bolsonaros mobilized racist and women-despising statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of Sao Paulo.
In the capital of Brazil, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run for office.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As the former mayor of the million-dollar city of Sao Paulo, Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
Although the “Trump of Brazil” has long been involved in political operations, it has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reaches the absolute majority in the first round, there will be a run-off election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from this - no matter who he competes against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again, he is shocked by verbal derailments.
On another occasion, he said that the supporters of Lula’s left-wing workers’ party should be shot.
Europe takes back Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, the European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale at the gates of Paris.

Danish rock legend dies after long illness
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsen’s website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become acquainted with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the disbanding of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at the hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bonesaw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure from three other bands.
After the sound check and just before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - will delight with their bands loudly the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night visibly.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced during the performance to a harmonious and powerful interplay.
Although "admission" calls are not to be missed, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage for the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", a synthesizer is also used in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-loaded rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has gained a special reputation since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China of 2017 - has a special stage experience is obvious and insurmountable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also puts his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound that feels even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo, running through the audience.
It goes without saying that a certain volume is part of such a hard rock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the Mischpult team, the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the hammer level, but is still clearly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", pointing to the "The Ignition" on their website.
Deafening 120 decibels in jet engine volume as usual in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need on this rock night.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bonesaw and set off a concert night with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say in the end, although in a figurative sense.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
On Sunday, a glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen Airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reports, a glider crashed in the exhibition parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
According to the WAZ, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is said to be a one-seater.
The plane was already on landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance away from a festival tent on the airport grounds.
A Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim/Essen is located on the city border of the two Ruhr area cities and directly on the driveway to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at major events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump slams Kim: 'And then we fell in love'
The fact that North Korea’s President Kim is well-off despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
But now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has announced a new flame.
Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old sprout of the Pyongyang dynasty, although it proves to be quite tough in the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
“I was tough, he was too, and it went back and forth between us,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it wasn’t just the conversation with Kim that made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump pointed to Kim’s announcement that all nuclear and missile tests would be stopped, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
That the affection for the infamous “Rocket Man” – Trump’s nickname for Kim – might not be everyone’s memory, seemed to the US president well aware.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism of this during his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How horrible, how horrible is that?
This is so unpresidial.
But he didn’t care much, Trump explained, and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then we wouldn't push 10,000 people out there into this crowded arena, we'd just have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric and also pampered by the sun full: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair Baesweiler's downtown on Sunday has brushed out.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest not only took place in the festival tent at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their disastrous detention conditions in Libya with the help of a mobile phone video, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and distributed it online.
“They refuse to send us back,” said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life.
One of his comrades was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Approximately 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homeland this year with the help of the program, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
He hasn’t heard of a phone call for help.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libya’s refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, dominated by large parts of militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her classes for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 16:50, the teacher entered the building through the main entrance.
In the front door of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase into the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police who initiated the investigation.
Whether or not money has been stolen cannot be said.
16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please provide information to the Obernberg am Inn Police Inspectorate, phone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure in his car several days and nights in a forest area in central Franconia, after he had stuck the car away from all forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by chance near a pasture and freed the missing person since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The retiree had been reported by his family as missing after he had not returned on Tuesday from a trip with his off-road car across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive searches, the man’s whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations between the two countries are currently “overshadowed,” Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This mainly concerns arrest waves, freedom of the press and religious freedom.
He has therefore made clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans in jail in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved shortly into a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence’s flight readiness at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn – but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan went on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
He said, “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their contact person - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump does not tire of emphasizing the successes of North Korea’s denuclearization negotiations, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for Washington to respond.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
“The recent standstill is that the U.S. relies on coercive measures that are deadly for trust building,” said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
“Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way we can disarm ourselves first,” he said.
That penalties could “force” North Korea on the knee is “a dream of people who don’t know us.”
In order to build trust, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, there have been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council had decided on three sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year alone.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged the United Nations to strictly comply with the penal measures.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will return to Pyongyang for talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth gathering, of which the many visitors of the House of Open Door HoT got nothing to do: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people at HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start of the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power outage had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
“Now we had to start over again: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone,” Westbuer said.
And that's how everyone packed it.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"It's also better for chefs," one visitor praised impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," emphasized Reverend Frank Beckmann, while wizard Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other feats.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW Board of Directors
Frustrated by criticism from its own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has given up his post in the national association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as deputy head of the NRW panels, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many fell in my back.
The head of the boards state association NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed sympathy to the dpa for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism came from Sartor.
"I can understand his step - people who didn't know exactly why Essener Tafel was doing it."
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," Weilerswist said.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels in the "World on Sunday".
We should not follow the approach, “without us, the people in the city are starving”.
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not take part in a conference of the panels on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm being told too much sweet scum," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that criticized me at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0-Leadership - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim by backlog - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2-0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports friends was great.
In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but won with 2:1 after 90 minutes. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to win with a 3-0
Gladbach plays twice - Schalke without embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for a away victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2-2, the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz to the first win of the season (1-0).
(sda) In the first five league games Schalke has maneuvered four times into the offside with early counter-tors.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco once again showed the strength with which they had taken first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute, after a strong preliminary work by Yevgeni Konopljanka, in the following the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets again from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated against Bayer Leverkusen a 2-0 backlog until the break, but came in the second half to the 4-2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) appeared with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublet in the final phase (86th/94) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The first victory was also won by VfB Stuttgart.
The Stuttgarters had to worry about Werder Bremen being decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in owner who helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a lead twice, played in the end 2:2 and still wait since 2003 for a away victory in the VW city.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to the 1-1, Renato Steffen was responsible with his second Bundesliga goal.
Yann Sommer was powerless at the flat shot of 20 meters of the Aargauer, as was the second hit after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalkeeper in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase came from OGC Nice for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven rounds Gladbach takes 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen maneuvered against VfB Stuttgart into an unpleasant position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first season goal, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serb cashed after a tricot swipe against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Red.
Although Stuttgart’s defenders Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremers back into the game through a curious throw-in owner (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters back into victory.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly for itself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already brought the home team on track with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens today vote on whether to change their country’s name in northern Macedonia.
If yes, the almost three decades of swelling conflict with neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its eponymous northern province and blocked any rapprochement of Macedonia to the West.
Voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The U.S. had announced that the country could quickly become a member of NATO if the referendum came out in a positive way.
Syrian in custody.
The refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three retirees and wounded them severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had raged on Friday at around 10 p.m. in the escape alley in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they addressed the accused, who went out with his clenched fists on passers-by and tried to attack them, to his behavior.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officials.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had just hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists on the ground at a tram stop in Währinger Strasse.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured “for an unknown reason,” as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave themselves a yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership was not eligible for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, that's right." He's been dating his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had stirred up a stir on June 30, 2017.
For example, he accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling up" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example, with respect to the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Citizens’ Association Children’s Home and the Society for Leprosy.
Because about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
“We are doing this to reduce costs,” said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Citizens’ Association.
And a lot has accumulated too.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape cut.
Because already in the spring the hedge has been shaved.
The breakfast that always follows the work has also a long tradition.
“Everyone has to stay strong,” said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Kanuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic circuit on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had already had enough rides here at the facility and everything fit today,” said the London 2012 Olympics.
In the finish, he threw his paddle away with joy and stretched both arms up victorious - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second place went to the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempted burglary in a single-family house this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of it again.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first attempted burglary this autumn.
The fact that it remained at the detached house on Königswieser Straße is thanks to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday shortly before 8 p.m.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
But the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they fled without prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Failure at Hertha: Overtaken by reality: Bayern against Ajax demanded
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not want FC Bayern to "please".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for Niko Kovac’s term.
The first small performance deck under the new coach Niko Kovac should by no means increase to the greater autumnal low for the Munich people.
“A week ago, I felt like we were invincible.
Now a bit of reality has caught up with us," Thomas Müller said after the earned 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Those who know us know that this really annoys us and that is why we give gas to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal was scored outside, as at the same time of the pre-season two compulsory games in series without victory, the table leading in the football league for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at the 1:1 with its running-intensive man-on-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last seemingly overpowering Bavarians are to be cracked.
“Those who know FC Bayern know that we don’t like this and we will do everything we can to be successful again,” Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he handled his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the once again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim result of his term positive - otherwise the tone is likely to intensify.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second premier class appearance of this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary game against Ajax begins as planned, which had also defeated Athens with 3-0.
“Now we’ve been caught in two games, but we’re going to make our goals again,” said National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The defendant appeared in the role as a warden.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old emphasized shortly before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were even behind Dortmund with five points, which has now taken the lead again with a point lead.
And so Kimmich rated with a wink at the eye at least positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavarians has now come to an end.
“Yes, that’s good,” said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line: Ozil-Cause: sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent dispute theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president severely criticized the dealings with the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
Early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally sharply attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the cause in the Mainz ZDF "sports studio".
"We have to draw very accurate conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - that this does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England,” Erdogan said in the cathedral on Saturday.
Honestly, as their president, I could not deny that our two young men, who have ascended to the German national team, were marginalized.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan’s statement that, unlike Özil, he felt “reasonably treated by the DFB” after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to be in front of players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
“I am very sorry that he has such an impression,” Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said.
However, he does not see a basis for a return of Özil to the national team.
As a result, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed.
“If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says: ‘The issue is important, we have to take care of it’, that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration must work,” said Grindel.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup out and the Ozil affair, he wants to run for the office as DFB president again next year.
“I do my job and try to do it as well as I can,” Grindel said.
A year old builds three accidents in three hours
Coburg/Rödental – As the police report, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic lights in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
He told the pensioner that he was driving against his car.
However, there was no exchange of personal data, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had come off the road and driven against a post.
In response, the man did not want any police on the spot and then drove away.
Afterwards, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has gone to his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Eventually, the police could find him and stop him.
His car suffered significant accidental damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1,000 emergency forces are still in use.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in the Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still employed in the extinguishing work.
This was reported by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency personnel is planned, it said.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire was discovered and erased.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which had been declared well over a week earlier on September 21, because it was feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and spark flight.
On Thursday, it was said that the fire would no longer threaten neighboring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 emergency forces tried to get the big fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus engineers.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand was sometimes drawn up to a hundred kilometers far beyond the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that accepts damage reports.
The first claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage for everyone came into force, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.

For example, he accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling up" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example, with respect to the right of adoption.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Approximately 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
Due to its northern province of the same name, it is the neighbouring country of Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for nearly three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they are also giving the start to the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 years old on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the US in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be withdrawn with explicit consent, Swisstransplant stresses.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that, as in Germany, organs can only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant stresses.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases, a card is found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, relatives do not know the deceased’s wish.
"You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome", so Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, at first everyone would be considered an organ donor, unless he or his relatives disagree.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head computation
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in head computation.
He won against 39 competitors at the weekend in Wolfsburg.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenceslaus from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retiree from France, as Chief Arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculator.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while computing.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were there two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms like superbrain, genius or miracle child, organizer Laue can do little.
“Heading can be trained,” he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India and Singapore, there are even computational competitions in stages.
The disciplines include, for example, square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates are given surprise tasks, for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans also had good chances here, the chief referee said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the favor, because head computation is taught more intensively and with other, effective methods from an early age.
Video with Naked Serena Williams: It's About Breast Cancer Early Detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows herself from her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and be strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate places.
Singer Chrissy Amplett has died.
The emotional video is part of the “I Touch Myself” project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
An emergency operation was initiated to save the baby's life.
Following a CT, blood clots in Serena’s lungs were discovered.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
The German government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called “symbols law” in review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle is shaking out her beds for the first time next week in the West: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual kink care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers are allowed to start with the annual kink care on Monday.
The "green walls" unique in Germany have been shaping the landscape of the federal state with few forests for around 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges that are up to five meters wide are "forestry" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the nature conservation association Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the orders of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and livestock fence, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time also his name "Knick" comes: By "bending" the branches could develop the dense, intertwined demarcations.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges extend between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7,000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
In one kilometre of kink, up to 1,800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only fulfill its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, it shrinks to a light row of trees, which in addition to biodiversity also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kink care may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on site
In an interview with the German editorial network (RND), local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
There I arrived on Sunday morning, because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were all completely destroyed.
Our World Vision office has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also housed other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they still stand out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partly steal food and gasoline.
The public service has completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners run freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that it did not work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people they don’t know if they live and where they are, because people weren’t at home during the earthquakes, for example, at work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don’t know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought, “Okay, no tsunami” – and then it came.
In other regions not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Isn’t an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Fire Ring, ready for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to forego Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had pulled a muscle fiber crack in the rear left thigh at the 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga player said on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle crack in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast of the downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival annually closes the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals.
In spite of all the movies, 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire department tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action lasted for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Walkers on Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the water station area.
To help the animal, the passersby called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the emergency forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a fireman with a bold handle.
The duck injured at the chest was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU to Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard to win World Cup medal
Fourth place at Olympia was Biathlet Julian Eberhard in the stomach for a long time.
The Saalfeldener wants to catch up with the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund next winter.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the medal to grab near.
Seven tenths of a second were missing on bronze.
"I deliberately took time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn’t want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to strike.
Eberhard is in Östersund (SWE): "I have already closed the track in my heart", he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year.
Immediately after Olympia he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of interviews planned is severely limited.
With a turbo-tempo FBI investigation, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the ultra-thin majority for the court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial over allegations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set investigators a deadline until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents over 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh’s vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer expelled angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judicial Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge in the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his initial announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the heavy remarks on Thursday as “crushed,” initially abstained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of “happiness in misfortune.”
In this way, the last doubts could be resolved, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely restricted investigators’ powers.
They will specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, nothing more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: “They are not going on a fishing trip.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses will be heard.
The mobile, installed in a "civil vehicle" radar device of the city community of Ried for monitoring the speed limit is stationed on the Gartenstraße, according to the city community from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The municipality also operates several fixed installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You have felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
However, against Mainz, the factor time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penal area,” said Schalke 04’s sports board – and breathed.
After all, the Royal Blues had managed to bring the barely 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season under the roof.
It could have been different.
After the leadership of Alessandro Schöpf 11 gave the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and pressing"., obviously more and more the head played a role with increasing duration of the game.
Not really a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours to me," Heidel said, "if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give this out of their hands and therefore retreated further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counts of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant share with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man's team."
In the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start with a lot of pressure in the initial phase and make a fireworks from it,” said Schalke’s chief coach.
Victory was important.
We can finally enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played smart, quiet and courageous, so we have to play games for over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather to ensure clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59/72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a shaking victory," said Tedesco, "you've already felt the fear a little bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He was not the only scoundrel.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker observed a fire in Leitzachtal on Sunday at around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
The cause was soon discovered by police and fire brigades: an unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two-square-metre area at Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it seemed that he had monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the embers unattended.
And that near the forest.
Thirty Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling apart and clearing.
Police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has once again followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my job for many years to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Culture Policy" in the organization of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in an intelligible way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and one or the other joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table sits German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to vote.
This leads to conflicts.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one ranks oneself politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first behave rather, then the discussion round starts more and more.
And there is a need for speech.
One Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands in front, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "only when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Also during the subsequent signing session, he still had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, was intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and Giessen win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and a away win.
Giessen prevailed in a hard-fought game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champion Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had significantly more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday for a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the Landsham-Süd area on the open market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick said.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots of land offered by the municipality on more favorable terms or prices is completed - similar to the former local model.
More than 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"Currently the documents are being reviewed" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Pliening mayor, the goal is to have prepared the candidate ranking list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
Subsequently, the award can be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with an estimated eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths will soon be paved.
A single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private individual, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, housing for about 200 people is created on the area of the new landsham-south area.
Not only that: Now, in early October, according to Frick, the start of the construction of a new daycare center takes place there.
It will accommodate three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalke's Naldo "great sport" also succeeds on the bench
Not in the start-elf for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in a row had not sat in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the Brazilian, almost two meters tall, had really spoken the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco to all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for simplicity, turned on and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was a great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his re-reservist existence, had no resentment whatsoever.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best scoundrel, knows that he did not actually get on his trainer's side - but gets a break for good reason.
A reason called "load control."
It was not easy to tell him
“It wasn’t easy to tell him that, I’ll tell you quite honestly,” Tedesco told the moment he told Naldo he wasn’t in the starting elf.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” said Tedesco.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone is able to sniff out at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which Naldo has also recently caught.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to accelerate its downward trend compared to the eurozone in August.
The purchasing manager index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third-best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still below the mark of 50 points for the 13th consecutive month, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland’s industry hit this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks finished with 42.1 points.
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March with 44.0 points.
“The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst has survived,” Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
But industry remains - in the third quarter anyway - growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as sharply as since November 2011.
The companies therefore dismantled positions for the seventh consecutive month.
Industrial production in China also fell more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices will be highlighted.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds behind victory in eighth league match
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
In the OGC Nice, the defending champion, thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar, won 3-0 (1-0) and was thus successful in the eighth league match.
Most recently Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar brought PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and made the final score in the follow-up time.
Christopher Nkunku (46.)
Thus, Paris also succeeded in the general rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the premier class, Tuchel's team had to accept the only compulsory game defeat this season at the 2:3 in Liverpool.
