Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after faster motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it by 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Transport policemen in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after observing it as it left a petrol station on the Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on the Burgess Road before he drove down to the Buschland, where the officials lost it out of sight.
The motorcycle as well as a person corresponding to the driver's description were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accused a 20-year-old man of non-respect for a stop signal as well as a thoughtless drive.
It shall appear before the Court of Justice in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.

George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The accusation is that Webster attacked her while she was "consciously sleeping, and couldn't signal any consent."
Webster is also challenged to have raped a second woman at Golf View Hotel in Naim on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of negotiation for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reconciliation to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congress members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil law.
"As trade unions die, the middle class jobs also die," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and deputy president of the Progressive Cucus congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the employee authorization law together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This breaching law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination about the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops forces so anti-employed.
The addition of the National Labour Law to create a possibility of discrimination exposed workers to organise a trade union representation in order to complain to a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation for damage or penalties - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it certainly is not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislation proposal suggests is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the reverses that trade unions have been exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and maintain labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the military autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full consciousness that the workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language expressly recognised that "the rights of workers to association and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Fascism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause expressly saying: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every profession or business.
Agreements restricting this law or aiming at reducing it are null and null; measures aiming at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the Presidency of the International Human Rights Commission, designed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everybody has the right to form unions to protect or join them."
Since generations Americans have accepted the basic premises that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union should then be protected in collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with companies and government bodies.
After these rights came under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to reconsider the American ideal, so the working population must have the right to unite and listen in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By increasing the living standards of millions of people, work has created a marvelous market for industry and raised the whole nation to unimaginable production levels.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - has long been overwhelming.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has raised in the past and solved the promises of democracy.
Judge stops temporarily law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force to close
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge suspended the implementation of a law in Louisiana, of which lawyers say that it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the state.
This measure, which was imposed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana in June and was to enter into force on September 1st, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a hospital's hospital's right of hospitals within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the judgeâ€™s decision means that doctors may continue to perform legal abortions provisionally while applying for such a law.
"The applicants can continue to work in compliance with the law as they strive to obtain these rights," wrote Bundesrichter John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing shall be made for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Advocates welcomed the decision, which was most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures, and said that doctors made so much more time to obtain hospital instruction rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana miss a deteriorating law that wants to take them their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the State to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the complaint and had also requested instruction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states who have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi not constitutionally.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Advocates of abortion and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that instigation rights require unnecessary restrictions.
Advocates opposed that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient instinct rights, the center of reproduction rights informed.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop taking abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation out of fear of his safety, the group said.
In their arguments against the judgment, representatives of the State Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the implementation of abortions, while their requests for patient instinct rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnostics and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have presented a video hommage online for their mother who died of egg cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, who found eggstock cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
CLEAN STUDY: New medicines may slow pulmonary and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, existing diseases, as well as the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer has been further advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of the telemedicine services to address distances, it proposed, as a possible remedy, a strengthening of the service of flooded doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women more closely in their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic status, the study showed a bad long-term survival rate in women in egg cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years, learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of oarstock cancer.
Garden centers regret sinking house owner numbers
The decline along with an increased reduction in the number of household owners under 35 years could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds per year when today's young consumers, according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "Cerne Age Group for Garden Products".
The report states that tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount that people with their homes spend on their gardens.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting gardens for park purposes and the sinking garden size are other factors threatening the industry, in which estimated Â£5 billion are implemented annually.
In London, where over a period of 6 years the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest expenditure for garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "Golden Age" of garden retail due to rising house ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also forecasted for this year a improved market situation due to the better weather according to unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergyman Tahirul Qadri in Pakistan continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators have stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters again from PTV buildings.
The transmitter launched its operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends it again.
At the same time, some 3000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a mile away, they delivered themselves with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused it.
The country's army therefore urges a political solution to the conflict "to waste without time and apply without violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military informed: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been eating more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan proposes Prime Minister Sharif to have deceived during the election in May last year.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to penetrate Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat due to spionage reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the US's oldest diplomats in the country on information of a report on American and British spionage in Turkey.
Vice Prime Minister Bulent said that the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German Magazine The Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that those of the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downset the importance of the report and said that all important countries were pioneering each other.
An earlier report that also had Germany's most important secret service in the sight of ankara has made clearer responses from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: locomotives threaten with consequences for pendlers
The Federal Warning Trail of the LokfÃ¼hrer on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The outbreak announced for 18 to 21 o'clock concerns all transport companies, including remote, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.

The district chairman of the German Lokomotive Guide (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in DÃ¼sseldorf, said.
We expect significant failures.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences specifically.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of pressure from police officers and employees of the city of CalviÃ  to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca.
The chief of the police from CalviÃ  on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption claims by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous Binge-Drinking-Hotspot Magaluf.
Following corruption claims against him, Commissioner JosÃ© Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of pressure from police officers and employees of the city of CalviÃ  to the office of the prosecutor for corruption against Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in conjunction with the corruption claims and are asked by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners claimed that the veteran economy of the authorities had serious effects on their businesses.
"It's no longer about earning money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our basis of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
This summer, Magaluf made international headlines for a viral YouTube video, showing an 18-year-old British tourist who performed 24 men during a surgery Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholized holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the infamously alcoholized chicken tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour Organizer Carnage have to pay a penalty of â‚¬55,000 (â‚¬73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÃœHLING has brought a winter surprise to South Australia, with intense spectacles and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21 o'clock another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already dropped to Sunday in the night.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a shot that began shortly before 20 a.m. and ensured almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After winter last week provided for an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell to a maximum of only 15.8Â°C on Monday.
The boring weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19.30 p.m., however, was hit by a screwwind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
At this time, wind pulses reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane also had to start on a second landing flight and finally set up at about 20.40.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including a Emirate flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum temperature of 16Â°C was predicted for Adelaide on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: Maximum time for big networking
In view of the galopping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech switch centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts with a highly familiar electronic accessories.
While I'm writing this here, my look is on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a reason for this: if the cable wasn't, all the listeners would fly around in the house in the shortest time, and that would be much more retro.
However, it applies to the eletronic (ekeltronic?
No, tip error: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electrical scrap of tomorrow is purchased - obsolete.
And for example, whoever still has a tube TV in the living room today, simply says that he refuses television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because ifa's tightening at the radio tower this week again leads us to our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The laie, who used to be blindly mastered washing machine and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread before him with incomprehensiblely ironic experts: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you all right?
What should be spoken about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quark?
In fact, for about 20 years, it has been most important for us to network our house.
So that the yoghurt will re-order itself so that the fire detector will tell us on vacation on the Maldives that it is just burning in the work room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were from the office from the air conditioning at our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We lift our bracelet clock, tell her loud "saugs!" - and at home the dust saucer goes off.
False.
Everything goes beyond nothing but a revolution: "The borders between white and brown goods are blurred," raunts a industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam-garer sends the weather report and the data glass shows how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but it does not help because we are in the stew.
We also know from the daily practice: When a new-modical device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What another reason is that the spiral cable will survive on the phone also the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in airspaces, while rockets and mortars were shot on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools remained closed in Gaza while the area recovered from the fights.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the municipalities in the south of Israel drawn by rocket holes, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" children's garden, which was hit by a rocket, removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in the Kibbutz Saad and there English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need the return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little funny" to go back to school suddenly.
"They were difficult times, and we haven't gone out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until the war stopped last week, thousands of residents of the border communities, such as Saad, remained in their houses or left their houses to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border of Gaza, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar granate, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education informed that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Her children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is hardly marked by the Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to an indefinite ceasefire.
The rest of the weapons ensured an immediate end of the fights; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for a withdrawal of the Israeli Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the re-opening of the airports in Gaza.
Israel demands a demolition of Hamas and the handling of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed at the battles.
A new round of indirect conversations is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of which civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contradicts these information and estimates that at least half of the killers are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai workers, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar granates during the fights on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
At the same time, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza region and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into provisional protection areas.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective areas and continue fighting, the education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school is soon open again so we can continue to learn, as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl challenges NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has spoken for an end to the current NPD prohibition procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition procedures against the NPD should be terminated before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts down worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU-Landschef in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a delightful development in the right direction and a development, which makes me more likely to achieve the political fight against the NPD rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had failed at the vote on Sunday very close to the five percent hurdle.
A first approach to a prohibition of the extreme legal party failed in 2003 because constitutional protection had also been in the NPD team of informants at that time.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new request in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
Bundesregierung and Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
Refugees are now housed in tents at the NeulÃ¤nder Platz.
The Central First Recording for Refugees in Harburg bursts from all the seams.
Now the interior authority has put up three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were notified just before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to prevent the citizens and give the district politicians no opportunity to contribute constructively to the human housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Its party demands that the district administration of Harburg currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be housed in the three tents.
Reasons for the refill in the initial intake are the storm of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Owns in Australian Capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the rise in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, informed that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-parted market.
The figures of RP Data show that the house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which was severely affected by the cuts in public expenditure and where prices increased by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless continued that the spring beginning would now have a rise in the real estate to sell for the next months, which would be "a real test" on the market.
"When one considers the constantly high rate of auction prices, a overall rapid sales rate and the continuously low interest rate environment, it is likely that the home prices will continue to rise even further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of Managing Director Peer Medau and testes this to pose "like a governor".
This is not the style of the university, says the Communication.
Thus, the Medau family had already been informed "By mid-June orally about the inquiry of the university.
The statement that the plans became known only in July is definitely wrong," says PÃ¶tzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "declarations or even decisions" but "preferencies".
The extension of the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
A nine-metre-width road was and is not the case.
It goes after current stand by 5.50 meters, which is one meter broader than before," explains PÃ¶tzl.
The argument of Medau operators that their free and school-based parking spaces will then only be used by university students in the future does not want PÃ¶tzl to apply.
Zugeparkt will not be at all because, as with other public parking spaces, it can now be solved intelligently.
Think of the residents
The Kids' Crip of Mountain Weichtel, which is located on the ground and which would lead the entrance to the Park Deck in front of its door, is said to be "not affected".
Rather, he considers "that this is not only about the child cripple, but also about the residents at the interference to the Friedrich Strib Street and the 800 students of the neighboring real school.
So it is much more than the particular interests of Mr Medau," said PÃ¶tzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent advisory board of the children's cripple, with the expansion of the road, would have been entitled to lose a "the few naturally left spots of Coburg" "the reader can decide himself".
At the beginning of October, PÃ¶tzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, wants to inform the City Councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 and address the importance of the new development in this context.
Peer Medau had informed the children's parents last week about the plans of the university.
Accordingly, the access to the new park deck is not to lead over the campus and the Friedrich-Streik-StraÃŸe, but over the Medau-Berg.
This means that the narrow road would have to be expanded two-spurely on about a mile long.
According to the mergers of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would thus multiply ten.
There are about 2000 vehicles every day.
From the sides of the city, it was not meant to express itself to the project.
Glandorf comes back from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to health problems in particular for this decision.
I did not like the decision, it has matured for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team," the 2007 World Master informed on his Facebook page.
It thus goes with a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 gates for Germany in international retirement.
Because the wrestling backroom player for the Champions-League winner from Flensburg still wants to go on Torejagd for a few years, he is no longer available to the new German coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced its framework for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have enthusiasmd me as they will also enthusiasm my long-standing fellow players and my followers.
But for my club I would like to be available healthyly in the next few years, for this longer regeneration breaks are needed, which do not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to fear his career end after a heel infection in 2012.
He had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Association (DHB) with a cortison syringe, which later caused a strong inflammation.
One emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career doesn't pass any body without a squeeze.
I have some health buildings that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infectious foot surgery that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure properly handled.
There are some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I control my head, I can't deceive my body," Glandorf explained in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the strings rip, I'm always ready to speak," said the two-fold family father to the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have become quite humiliated with regard to my health.
After my career, at least I want to go straight.
He won the EHF pocal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Population of Pocal victors with Flensburg.
German economy decreased by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have inhibited the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was communicated by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
In spring alone, the economy was experiencing while the investments decreased.
The external trade also brake the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual activity, a total GDP percentage of 0.8 percent for the first half of the year is generated compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "MÃ¼nsterland-Mooiste", which led the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmann City of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "fiet drivers" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "MÃ¼nsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest bike tour across the MÃ¼nsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organization of this tour through the MÃ¼nsterland.
These tour interested parties were offered in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and have traveled overnight to take part in this tour.
We want to get to know the MÃ¼nsterland once more in this way," the cyclists welcomed the route through the circles Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the Vereinsheim der SchÃ¼tzenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
The route, which was written for three different categories, led back to Horstmar in the direction of the SchÃ¶pinger Mountain in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Bildbeck.
On 95 kilometres of 1175 meters of height, 120 kilometres with 1475 meters of height and 145 meters with 1775 meters, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were nursed on the way in Havixbeck and Bildbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor deputy Heinz LÃ¶lfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization remained without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz LÃ¶lfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see again in 2015 with hopefully beautiful weather on August 30, or during another weekend," however, cyclists promised to return to MÃ¼nsterland, and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Constantin Weckers unfairly honest memories
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Constantin Wecker, singermaker, pacifist, politically safe activist, ex-headed, in "MÃ¶nch und Krieger" has brought to the paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thoughts, the Munchner born on 1 June 1947 wrote his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable lyrics.
And he is unprecedentedly honest: From Onanie as a gymnasiast to shoplifting and drug use, he doesn't leave a human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also takes abstract, but more important terms: Love, soul, ego, Being in Now, Spirituality - all that he tries to go on the ground in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment, as well as how not only the music influenced him (the opera lovers became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the Ascetic monk, which "crees through subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary".
But there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the high mindful views: for example about battering in a GIs frequented locality or a mad drive where he visited a tree frontally.
He's unfairly honest too.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children of a family of Japanese immigrants in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry testes for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of Reggae and Rap, with vibrant melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
They never saw his face, just stopped his voice, "Have the crash.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown when I was a child - went with him into the cricket and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beating.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner of the newspaper.
Recently Henry opened a molding in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they are dark, smoked, deep rising labyrinth with flames and smoke and much rust.
My father used to simply lay in the waist and then he was slowly heard as he started singing because he could wash the molding from himself.
When I ran around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him grew bigger.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parentsâ€™ testimonies of love.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was bad at the end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop "I love you"?
Stop embraceing me!
Daddy, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still friends with French, with whom he was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's hard.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's change of career may be shown in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been confessed by the theater.
It followed the comic of the mistakes, and then the fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and Comodies who have filled out his busy working life.
He started at only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for a very long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow up not only in front of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient jokes story machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right of stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people were "black painted," Henry launched his comedy there over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "great parodie of black people."
By the introduction of figures that both mocked and celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on mission in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedy Series Chief!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles marked his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels everything like you're just bringing the time around or stepping a little.
Afterwards a documentary for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was quite allergic.
I had never really learned about him at school and thought he was predominantly a domain of middle class, white in stroppy pants and a cabbage head in front.
So I was very scared of that.
All of us interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, said Judi Dench, "You should try it.
Don't be bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recorded 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I felt I could do that.
It was almost like someone finally put my head right on me.
"There's this, it's a serious thing, take them seriously, learn your text, look for a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
Soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to talk to the audience.
"A little voice told me, "You have to bridge over 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the head of the stage announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and said something in me, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences on Duke's Theatre
Learning the text for fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
This too came well, so it's like a big sign of the gods who tell me "This is your destination."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERD voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really love this.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is through humorous outbreaks, while he repeats imitating people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for this, you'll drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes live in Apollo when I like to do this, but in total there is not as much as I did before.
I'm asking him if he's ever going to take a stand-up comedy tour.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Jemen's capital
In the conflict between Shitian Huthi rebels and the Jemenite government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sadah.
Huthi trailers would have occupied central streets in Sadah on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report about a chaos of traffic in the capital.
According to the online edition of the "Yemen Post" newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened, according to the sheet, with a further escalation of the conflict, its demands should not be met.
The Shitic Huthis fight for more independence from Sunnitic ruled Yemen and demanded the resignation of the government.
The Huthi People's tribe has besieged the Jemenite capital for nearly two weeks.
Approximately 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major roadways of Sadah.
In the surroundings, bloody fights with the Jemenite army are repeated.
Kenya registered officials to inhibit "Ghost staff"
Kenya has begun to register all government officials biometrically to remove "ghost employed" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people will receive salary payments even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in public service in 2013.
At an examination at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least 1 million dollars (70,000 Â£) per month were lost in payments for "ghost employed" and other misuse financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person died or leaves public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from Nairobi capital.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been notified in a government notice.
All those who did this without a credible apology would be removed from the salary list continued the communication.
"This approach contributes substantially to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and adjusting the salary list at both government levels - so the "ghost employees" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal around the art advisor Helge Achenbach is first negotiated in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi-GrÃ¼nder Theo Albrecht, demand a damage of Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil process at the DÃ¼sseldorf Landgericht.
That was what a court speaker told on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach deceived during the purchase of works of art and oldtimers and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher than actually paid purchase prices.
This would also have increased the agreed commission.
Achenbach purchased value items for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
44 years in school, of which 23 were heads of school.
From this time Manfred Judges know many known Petershausener and Collbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always wore by his striving to see the people in the pupil.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordbohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was interested in the teacher's career after four years of high school.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were engaged.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight cargon.
So it slipped Judge into the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
Teaching took place in Bamberg.
Manfred judge had to run ten kilometres per week to the nearest train station, drive to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the entire city to school and return to the evening.
After two months, Manfred Judge got a sleeping place in a red creuz home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a sleeping room.
In 1951, he made the second state exam after three years.
Since he had no free teachers for Oberfranken, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "FrÃ¤ulein-Zimmer" was his first "Servicewohnung" in the school house.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room apartment in the newly built teachers' house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Judge in 1980, after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the 1968/69 school year these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then president Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Judge became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, so the children and their teachers were able to obtain the building today, which was expanded in 1997 according to Judge's retirement.
Manfred Judge praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig GÃ¶tz, who, at municipal costs, also built a work space and with the extension of 1997 cellar rooms, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Burgermeister GÃ¶tz was very school-friendly," judge remembered gratefully.
In his career, Manfred Judge never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a meeting of a school council on justice and justice: "You should never forget love." Manfred Judge implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn: "It doesn't always succeed". Whether he thinks only his pupils or his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's doing was sometimes unconventional.
When pupils beat themselves, they did not get a criminal work from him, nor were they doomed for the aftermath.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had two pair of box gloves created and made the two counterparts stand against each other, even though there should be a veil.
As a rector, judges used a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig GÃ¶tz (CSU).
This moved the partyless judge after his retirement to compete at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
But Judge was preselected at place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicycle riders in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten intermediate stops
If cyclists make their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scotland rest, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of races was impressed: The 700 participants of the hr4-radtour and accompaniedtross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the Schottener Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Radles and celebrate on newly discovered ways between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday, where they met a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists attacked the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started with the bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-DÃ¶ring.
For the refreshment of body and spirit, all kinds of good things have been prepared: the landwifes from Ranstadt and down-mocket town have baked 85 sheets of apple, dwarf, scatter and cheese diseases, which wonderfully munded the skillful cyclists.
"These cakes can only bake landwives," praised one participant from Aulendiebach while ordering another piece.
At the beverage stand of the GeiÃŸ-Nidda tournament, cold refreshments were obtained.
The "Duo Bravo" interviewed the visitors with well-known melodys from operettes and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
Moreover, a man liked a head massage by his partner: "He deserves it, finally, he has already re-engined cycling chains again today."
As a result, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking core house by Reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also the head of doctor Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-radtour in 2004 as a tour manager, was able to snatch shortly, but he had abundantly to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he wrote Facebook entries and made reportages with his employees and the 15-body motorcycle rope of the police Hessen, through three phones and a radio device, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from casting or fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia cyclists are travelled.
The number of participants is a bit based on the available overnight capacity.
In Category I, the participants are housed in hotels, in Category II in collecting accommodations.
From the resort, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up after a half an hour: "But!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they winked to the finish.
After arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the leadership of the Schottener Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festivity and, of course, it had been prepared for delicious things, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus HÃ¼ssfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his role as board member of ADAC Hessen-ThÃ¼ringen, welcomed the visitors.
The three were evidently delighted by the "many operation in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
Despite the sporting activity on the bicycle, the opportunity to move under the open sky was eagerly used.
Among the guests increasingly blended citizens who were as touched by the good mood as well as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, for cyclists the stations Birstein, WÃ¤chtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Twenty Turkish police arrested for "compliance" against the government
A total of 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of the "compliance against the government", reports local media agencies.
Police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level policemen, reports HÃ¼rriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government staff, including four government ministers last December.
A number of Turkish police officers were arrested in July because they had supposedly founded an organised criminal association and had been in charge of telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described its action as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergyman Fethulla GÃ¼llen against him and other persons in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday, September 1, after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
He told journalists there that not all schools had opened up again, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not everywhere across Ukraine peaceful.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
All Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, school director of the school in Slavjansk, the Jazenjuks daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace again and that the children will receive a education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud glorious loop from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consultancy Bain and Co., which changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and retired when the top post of the parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their borrowing was supposed to be nearly 1 million pounds.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant of the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
I already described the Chairman's task in May with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: to the inside on the first garde of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things run wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol that demands a complete comprehensive reform.
But which newly arrived chairman would risk taking on everything and breaking up an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might kill himself his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtake.
While the competition approaches and threatens new technologies to old, comfortable security, the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of Â£ 145.50 per year, the British public is buying itself into the most certainly largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: she says she reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pences per day.
And the BBC seems to rise up again on the popular scale: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and utilization habits for the BBC have changed: I'm getting news stamps on my phone today and seeing missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loved and remarkable institution.
She needs a great chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that decreasing Tweet was not authorized
A second of the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a deteriorating comment on the democratic district attorney, which is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of official authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another by Perry's user account that dismisses the previous one.
Just a Tweet has been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't afford the Tweet and have deleted it," said the later message.
Employees of Perry did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually used the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavorable image of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was sentenced to be taxed in April 2013 for drunkenness.
Perry put a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to resign, which led to a charge against Perry - which might be presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the Tweet is: "I don't always drive drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol level ... but when I do it, I'm accusing governor Perry when he pollutes it."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the leadership of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was run by Michael McCrum, a special state attorney from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry claims not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal assistance requested the judge responsible for the case to reject the charge and argued that the law, which is made against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas, is unreasonablely diffus.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government funds to the State's Public Integrity Unit, located in Travis County and founded in cases of state corruption in Texas, when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint on the part of a left-hand Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After completing the elections in Iowa during his presidential candidate for 2012, Perry entered into speculations that he would stop by posting a twot of a photo of himself near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains housing market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent operators pointed out that the housing market in the southeast of England was "return to the normal level".
Ownerships in the capital were very desirable and the subject of enormous price increases, which moved the Bank of England because of the widespread fear of a loan bubble to set ceilings for mortgage credits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the highest level of 2013" and added that this offers a "stable operating environment".
The property market in London was well established during the demolition, as foreign buyers drove into the capital.
According to the cataster office information, prices in the city area alone increased by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales in total.
The average sales prices for Berkeley's private, price-value and student offers increased by about one fifth last year and was around Â£ 423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive for foreign buyers in recent months â€“ some of them have also been deteriorated by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetorics for a possible "fowl tax" before the general elections in the next May.
During the last week, the London Real Estate Makler Foxtons warned that the mortgage market report for April, in which more stringent loan schemes were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in real estate sales and in prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in the mortgage authorisation in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling off.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 to 3 percent, based on a weakening house price consciousness already.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now declined by a quarter year by year, according to the Makler WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the due amounts of timetable sales amount to more than Â£2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result the deadline sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the highest level 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40 percent annually to Â£280 million, sales by 18 percent to Â£1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley was expected to meet current market expectations during the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result at Â£450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at Â£23.96 in London's trade in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence by hacker published on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appears at the 85th Oscar ceremony.
Nackfotos of Oscar prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "Masterlist" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tributes of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and charged the hacker for "eklatanized violation of privacy".
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who continue post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were reported to have been acquired by a gap in the online storage system iCloud from Apple. The so-called "Master List" of Hacking Victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have taken up in the private environment of our home years ago - I hope you're really satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" disagreed that the photos of her act and twittered "These so-called naked images of me are FEELING, people.
Let's just take the beginnings. *Wortspiel intends*.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a spokesman of Popstar Ariana Grande dismissed the authenticity of the supposed photos of her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly promised new novel about love and the letter "J".
They were crushed, so they could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard that one left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distanzed and perhaps a bit scratchy.
And then shake his hand.
He knew scratch-brushed.
He was stubborn, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stubbornness was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for a illumination of the lonely boredom of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even had brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with uncoated hair and a flattering heart from a village on the north island, which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion who considered Kvern to be her aunt, and who had inherited a property in a moist but paradise valley with the appropriate name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were lick, the bathrooms were still spiders, necks had left their marks on all windows and believed that they belonged to all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kvern had saddled with ailins on the broken sun loungers in high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had become absent in the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news when the view of their crowned brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, who his father liked to listen to at closed rolling stores in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their harsh aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was banned so properly - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, as the word obsoleses.
The general taste created what had never been done and regulations, and as the people in books choose the Vanm-Tellerwasher-to-Millionary monuments, cooking books and romans, they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kvern began to play an imaginary piano and sing large feet in a rough-come serenade of Ailin.
Ailin didn't understand that.
"That was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was young.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It hadn't been a very fun game at the time, and it wasn't very funny at this time.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailin had never heard any.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly banned.
Improvising was no longer modern.
It was only room for a single "if" in life.
The people wanted to be very sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kvern knew something about jazz about his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, there were no laws or impulses.
A complimentary society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of group gift - thankful as those spared by fate.
People of Afro-Caribic origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran.
People who originally originated from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as naturally and were responsible for ensuring that no family remained without a working service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the channelization; what was left of the Greeks, crushed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WHAT HOW, WHAT IT WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE WHAT-WHAT fear of being accused of fire sheds, even feared that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha piping restaurants, kept in mind and became depressive with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn was difficult to understand how the offensive words that the cheers had just spoken to her could ever be displayed.
Music was expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," said Kvern.
Except for people whose feet are too large.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge cabbage-like leaves.
Ailins still did not understand.
Why would your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook unbelieving her head and locked Kvern's view.
There was nothing else to see all over the world than her unemployed raven black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," I mean them without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're saying it to me.
She seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't so directly.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
You hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but for that it was too early.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you're falling on me," he tried it instead.
I'm a little bit perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often brought himself into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm that one needed to embarrass the cruelty in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be that, Kvern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailin Solomons became red and lifted up from her chair, threw the console around and poured the wine they had drunk.
Holunder blossom wine, so drunkenness wasn't apologizing for him.
In her excitement she seemed to be trembling, like palm beads in the storm.
"And your thickhead is exactly the reason why I feel perverted to you," she said...
Except I'm not.
She regretted him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words as well as the fear shown in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke down here as did there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more detrimental to DEM WHAT WHERE WHERE as their ancestors were smugglers and beach robbers, moved from Kneipe to Kneipe, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or defeated them.
Thickhead?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn't care!
They first knock - knutches was the most common word for erotic attraction between men and women, a countertox to the non-speaking love ball charges from the console - they first knock and then beat.
In Kvern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the nutsman himself was already an act of violence.
Ailin Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He got out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt blurred, but the wake of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew.
She watched him as he left - as from a room on the top floor, her companion watched him - a man, complained by something he had sworn himself up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed well known if she couldn't remember one time when she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
Several years before the recent incidents, Esme Nussbaum worked, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for public mood, at a short talk on continued violence at low and medium level in exactly the parts of the country in which their reduction, if not abolishing, was most expected, in view of the funds and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has already been done much, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to relieve the inborn aggressiveness of a people who has led thousands of wars and most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness was rarely felt historically despite the highly-examined church towers between the hooks.
But some characteristics are unequivocal.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion he continues to awaken.
The population is crying when listening to sentimental ballads, depriving of stories of overwhelmed difficulties and claiming to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the former roughness holds the rural communities as well as our urban structure in hand, but there are also evidence for the emergence of a new and sustaining strife at home, at the workplace, on the streets and even on the gambling fields.
"They have an unhappy tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said when he had read the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask, are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme called for her right to privacy and refusal to say.
Feministin?
Still silence.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, reading or feminism.
This is a prejudicious job.
We serve a non-profit society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in itself are absolutely acceptable and laudable, can occasionally distort results as you suggested them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things which you call "hinder" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as well as expression of a natural force and vitality.
If one continues on the way, WHAT IT IS, WHAT IT IS, as if it had happened yesterday, it means to take its essential vital vitality to the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or longer.
Smile at their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use her phone, talk, explain, listen to, agree to, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the singed word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want to go," answered Esme Nussbaum with a quiet voice, when she was sure that her supervisor had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may find ourselves again, as we repeat the mistakes that are at all to the fact that it has led.
But this time it's not the others we leave out of our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an English patience.
"They go too far," he said, "if you call actions as "error" that our grandparents may have done or not.
They're too far, too, if you're talking about that these had left their "wraths" and their "misstraus" to "others".
It should actually not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we speak of "us" and "other" when we understand the past as in protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there were no "other."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared, "no part of society can claim to have done well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or well done what happened, it has happened.
That was then.
We don't have to say anything - we agree.
And just as no debt needs to be allocated, no debt must be paid if such a eradication would be appropriate and if there would be a way to cut it out.
But to what does the past serve if we do not learn from it--
The past is that we forget it.
If I can say something about it,
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I'll think of her report," he said and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorcycle driver who, as described by passers, had traveled in a kind of "great rage".
There are accidents.
Lesotho Military Member says that no state strike is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the Army in Lesotho argued that they had planned a state strike for the collapse of the government and said that they were opposed to police to whom the armed forces of political fanatics are provoked.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and informed that the army of the country had changed its office and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The premier brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after reporting of attack threats.
Military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no state dispute in fact, but the military reacts to the threat of "political fanatics", whose armed forces were coming up by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces acted after receiving several secret service reports that within the police some elements were acting that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were shortly facing devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a crash.
"Although no one has claimed that the government has been robbed by violence, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces have so far shown signs of a state strike," he said.
On Sunday, speakers of the Lesotho military informed that the soldiers were back in their barracks and that the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Vice-President Mothetjoya Metsing takes over government management during Thabane's absence.
Thabane told that he believed he had become a target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There have been great tensions in Lesotho since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his unity government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, otherwise alleging accusations to despite.
Production in the euro area at a 13-month depth
The increase in production in the euro area has slowed down in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a precisely observed study.
The final brand shopping manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.
New contracts declined and factories experienced breakdowns in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall take place before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect a clear plan of the Bank to deal with a deteriorating recovery of the euro area as well as a threat to deflation at a inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the ECB's head, Mario Draghi, could make further information during this week whether he considers a quantitative easing for the euro area, according to those made by the UK and the USA during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth at all, the inevitable effects of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner in Russia in the EU, fell at the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism, Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer soothing, too," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to shake the fire of the analysts that expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Head of Economics at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the shopping manager index of the production industry in the Eurozone of August is that afterwards the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are currently very difficult to live, as the current increased geopolitical tensions, especially in Russia and Ukraine, increase uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably leads to delaying or even canceling some contracts, especially large contracts.
He said that it would be "more likely" that the ECB must eventually introduce a type of QE, "even though we suspect that this will be limited."
The hell decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Czech militias in a school in Beslan in Southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyr that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom.
Just a decade after the terrible siege of the school of Beslan, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into abusiveness, and then, surprisingly, turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom at the crueltat.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That of the war that Ukraine is now angry - and in the children like they die - now ends.
The girl who was photographed during the attempt to climb back to the broken school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she was only trying to climb back to the broken school sports hall after a mine had exploded.
Aida was totally confused and searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at the time.
My legs were bloody.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier made her safe.
After a series of operations, she considered herself completely healed, but yesterday said: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need to be operated again.
Some pomegranate fragments are still in my knees.
Their goal is now to become a dentist to help the people how she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says floodyly.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I end my study and begin my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, although the memory becomes slightly weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and contribute to the fact that this is not happening again.
The boy who fled through the ball, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (walking at 7 years of age) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "Mama told me that I should lie down when there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearful that she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a weeping little child, grabbed it by hand and fled through a ball.
His father Wladimir, who closed his son in his arms outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, on her part in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir was later fought to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World), to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to be blasser in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toys guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids I played with in the courtyard, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy shop where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a top-open car.
But now he is afraid of the place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamity that he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd like to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me at the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers her journey to London with Damir vigorously.
The people in London wept when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the possibility of traveling to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how Damir and me helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and call them all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with cellars in a restaurant. Damir shot his water gun on her and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think this world hasn't improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe many children were killed and still killed.
These are just like our kids.
I think for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he's not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the sports hall and burn candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered under it - I remember how he sometimes sat on the sofa, the face turned off from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys on. Damir is now 17, greater than I am, good looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with all around body parts.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy couldn't have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was so sure that he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, continues for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the Gruel of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-flowed face was marked by fear when he ran around his life, while Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbari of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had put him off for his first day of school before she hurried to bring her older son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There's no day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time ago, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days, always pursuing me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was perpetrated as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij wanted to go to school this day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at our home in the book shelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It's important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes a terrible thing.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st September goes closer.
I want my old childhood boyfriend's tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life continues.
I finished school this year and visit a medical university in Vladikawkaz.
I'll be a heart surgery.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived even though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was fixed at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better after that, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I'll never return there and don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Surviving: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I wear it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
I'm okay.
I should be careful with my hurt knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, also the medical people, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinarian institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew that I would never report my experiences to my children.
Children should not know anything about this and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's worse in my soul when the anniversary comes closer.
I'll go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much more intense for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that if something is so unfair to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but no sports.
I would say he overcame the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege, and this only strengthens my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and they were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is crying for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that in Ukraine many children have already been killed and many are killed.
If we could only grab and throw all these rebels out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tsjajewa, 10
The baby, which was worn in security by a special commission
Gerettet: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special commission (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelties at all
The world stopped the breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was worn in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in her cruelty, her 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar were in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has married again since then and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana that he has named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, now ten years old, doesn't remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, says neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which can be both for about $300.
I have recorded these photos at a family festival with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Depending on the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery box and other subjects are closed.
Set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and Camcorder have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the insane underwater conditions.
And before you jump into, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not fold.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that you can compose images, action-cams usually do not have.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to watch this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So take a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a line mode with which a number of recordings are made with slightly modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you make recordings in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Come close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is even more important under water because of bad light conditions.
It is especially important when you work with an action-cam: These devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame of the image.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an advisory anaesthesia doctor, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the pain of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 coworker who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnosis and diseases are important to the doctors, while the patients are mainly involved in something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulty retarding myself.
While fighting with the grip-like symptoms, he noticed that he made unpatient accusations to his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather like everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt very unusual and unreasonably disturbed.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesotheliom, an unhealable cancer that attacks the breast fever, i.e. the skin that surpasses the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers are smoking pulmonary cancer, not all lung cancers have previously been smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which once was considered a "wondering substance", but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesotheliom is a disease that can as easily ignore.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in the UK since the 1960s than the industry voluntarily committed to stop using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - glue, construction workers, roommen and yard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems hardly worrying today.
But this self-sufficiency is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems, today experiences the highlight of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths due to Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesotheliom deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we experience the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 was prohibited all asbestos types), is that a mesotheliom develops only after decades.
And the assault of the Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses we live in, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom knows no class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from elegant shops in London to private schools, are not a protection room.
Parliament buildings are asbestos-degraded.
Even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been formed as a herd of origin.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a clamper either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and peasants - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"From the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital, and who have suffered from Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one still alive."
How many of us will be sick?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
That was an unusual long time of survival.
Fifty percent of mesothelio diseases die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still being sick?"
Britain's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to occur in the UK, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be victims.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like that.

A brief look at the acts of the courts, which are often addressed by the victims because of claims to damage, shows how far the assaults of the Mesotheliom are already spread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them of the flagship stores in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twenty.
"Before this thing," she says, "I've never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me once.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers, not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe risulations, boile risulations, even for brake covers in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still considered by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with possible death consequences.
However, the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the unique high mesotheliomrates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliom victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her history is not unusual at all.
He presented a study of the subjects, stating that "a substantial proportion of the mesotheliomes without known suspension by work or in the house was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one could be sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been unknowingly exposed to the material.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be pollinated by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite.
While the Directorate of Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the West Minster Palace has received a "clean health certificate", it is now unanimous that 1 billion Â£ work effort must be imposed over several years to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, the Members will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the existence of asbestos was not handled according to the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do is wait.
A person who could never exactly determine the contact with Asbest is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to the asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you worked on, and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009 on which he received such a kind of fever.
He was 45 and performed an operation just late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had shit lfrost.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make the ride home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest fell, the skin around his lungs, caused.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors made X-ray recordings of his breast and put on Pleurakathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient received abbots with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom.
But even now Abbott did not link this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011 Abbott's condition deteriorated and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbot had felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the breast fell.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just continue," he says.
Honestly, I hadn't worried so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: "It was told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering.
Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who ate in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground cantons (such as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely to be in contact with the toxic substances.
It appears that over several decades after the war hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treatment doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their cousins on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its fabulous insulating and flaming properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, pupils have placed their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is often addressed on websites.
And as innocent things in our houses, such as floor plates or roof roofs, have normally included asbestos.
"It is an industrial gift that is included in large parts of our properties," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a woman affected was the demolition of a garden in the 1970s.
So watch out how you're breaking off your garden.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealable is immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective change from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient was.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very hard to take all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long do I have?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't experience another Christmas party.
It was."
Mesotheliom is particularly suspicious because it is our lifekeeping mechanism - breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is thrown up and the fibers are inhaled, they can put in the chest fell, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast fell and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who changed to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed him to the asbestos is now ironic, a leading center in the treatment of mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their studies in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos reach the pulmonary tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancers do not work so well in mesotheliom.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hot controversial.
Some think she's worth an attempt.
Treasures necessarily.
"You can't cut the chest fell out," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Because of this, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," the "Effection Shows", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consultancy office for the participants four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Centre," he presented himself happy when calling.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, abbots were offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and expected to prolong his life only by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at the Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not being rejected, I just called and got a date," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesotheliom patients in order to observe the best available therapies.
But if these treatments eventually fail unfortunately, many affected people are of another financial concern - about the future of the families that leave them behind.
And so they turn to the judgments in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan by Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that one realized that a very low load was also a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally explained their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "complete compensation" because Lawson could not prove absolutely that his mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact with the Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, however, a spokesman of the Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibers were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is for mesotheliom patients who strive for compensation, a huge problem of asbestos contacting a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the prosecutors.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliom subjects to complain to compensation, even if their former employers cannot find out any more.
The law has set up a Â£350 million funds fund fund fund supported by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 can prove a contact, but nobody can sue.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 percent of what a court could have addressed to them in a normal compensation process - about Â£120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks as many mesothelioms affected that Â£350 million were a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time had not passed over and Mesotheliom patients could find the companies and normally succumb them.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in view of seven death victims, fast action was necessary every day.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year.
At that time Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course with the most important," Abbott says.
It's always seen in patients.
There's something that lets you go on.
If you give up, you'll be much worse.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
This is not life threatening.
That's life-effective.
Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
No trace of the Tumore is now visible.
But the process is physically and psychically very strenuous.
You have to think about practical things - about money if I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"For parents this is hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl I had a disease with which I wouldn't get old.
They responded very differently.
Tamsin is very cozy and impulsive.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was reluctant.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to endure.
But for mesotheliose persons, such conversations are not through hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as finally also for Stephen Jay Gould) brings an angry security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong vote despite the increased calls for democratic reforms.
This approach is likely to fire the long-proclaimed protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led the planning and mobilisation to do so within a few hours after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking-faith candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said lawyer Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to Hong Kong's inhabitants.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an autoritary regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision Li Fei, vice-general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned control over Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised that the inhabitants will be given the presidency of the government from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision from Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct electoral right to the Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the course in hand by a closely controlled nomination committee.
After a new clause, only candidates should be admitted "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests have been held in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shoot the financial district if Beijing does not allow any real general election law.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central trailers had gathered in front of the headquarters of the government in Hong Kong within a few hours after the announcement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide further information to prevent problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers informed that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action that is to take place only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and no other choice exists.
We are sorry to say that all dialogue opportunities have been exploited today and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijings for days, and there were stronger security measures including police forces and barricades on Sunday before the government building.
The unrest is strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.
The attraction of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Moreover, the fear that the values of Hong Kong such as democracy and freedom of speech under the growing pressure of Beijing are beginning to fall.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central Movement, as they threatened the business - the life vein of Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they continue," said Judicial Expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to fear that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights where 780,000 people participated - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduate balls in the USA is now transferred to universities where Freshmen performances are offered with the private aircraft.
We are looking forward to responding to this demand and offering the first luxury travel service of Great Britain for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also indicated that the service had a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cushion their possessions in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One speaker said that no new bookings had yet been made since the service had just been introduced, but added that "Students would book the service in the next weeks".
The company also informed that despite the study fees of Â£ 9,000 a year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today, in their expectations and expectations, differ very much from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start study this month are exposed to a crisis of living costs, since the available financial assistance in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep stepped up with the strong rising invoices for the simplest basis of life before they can even remember spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize breeding and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teen was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Holds up, don't shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teen Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproduction law and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West rose and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared with the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9th, personal essays with titles such as "Thinks to Ferguson of a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism you find many people who are white and speak privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt impressed to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so etnized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson revealed problems that black Americans are subjected to every day, but they are not regarded as "women themes" in cultural space.
"I can publish something fun on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colorful in their own country are besieged, silence is deceptive.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who have studied racial, gender and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the topics of race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lined, and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynchmord.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's election law such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for election law could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to apply to the right of women's election, and the right of election for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
Remembering such things, you become aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't make our job good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade to organize white women against the bandage in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flut of white feminist reactions to questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminist women played "fears" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Isn't it great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to reception control?" Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation, who built up their career in the fight for reproduction rights and access to conservative means, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went to Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans about racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a risk inhabited to the body - and opinions about race that are quite different in public surveys - will lead to changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which breeding and gender topics are addressed, some of their comments on the racial theme in America are astonished.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminist women, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police with the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police attacked nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwest border of the country this year, the theme of immigration reform is also reappeared to the surface - this time as a women's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the topic as an essential women's theme, she should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reputation in the women's organizations," she said.
"Swine house" in Ipswich stands for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents, when it became clear that it showed a large pig that it had made it comfortable in the living room.
The free-standing house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for Â£120,000.
Among the details was an illustration of the living room of the house - one of which was a pig that had bed his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo, however, has been unfairly published and has now been removed," said a spokesperson of the company.
In the ExposÃ© of the House, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it appears still on advertising material.
The sale of the house provided interest in the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after lotto win
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth lasts, with a happy winner who gets from the lottery attraction on Saturday almost $1,1 million.
A newspaper skiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot in the first division for the second time in five years, after 1 million dollars in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner must still report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profits provide for conversation material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and all are quite excited.
We thought such a profit could take place.
Eight WA winners celebrated profits in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had gained the mega gain of $7.5 million only a few weeks before.
The winner couple had played for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas bat in Gladiatorenarena
Not only were the gladiators in the matsch at the first Rheinbacher Roman Day in the recreational park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who were reluctant to the rainseeers and the herbly cold, and have been enthusiastic about the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful range of representations, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force from the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust fighting art in the soft sand-prepared arena.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and wise presenter and sent his men to the ring to the heroic two struggle in various Gladiator genuss.
At first, the "provocators" were on the line with rectangular sign and short gravity as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short gravity and wurflant as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who hit the "Secutor" with Wurfnet, Dreizack and Dolch and struck the Burschen to the ground after a short fight.
As the swords forced metallicly together, the shields shattered and the shields flew through the arena that a fear and bange could become around the health of the gladiators.
But on that the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular arbitrator, had a always attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era liveable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Roman Kanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the recreational park became an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage found in his greeting word.
Finally, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remnant of it were also to be amazed at the Roman Day, such as "AquÃ¤dukt-Marmor" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Channel bridge, which once stood at LÃ¼ftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once presented water and energy supply, and now compared, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of then."
This also confirms diploma measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "Ingenieur TeamZwei" from Rheinbach, who introduced the instruments of measurement by the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocous, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressively also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millenniums ago in the footsteps of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the Federal Federation of the Federal Republic of Rhineland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Commercial Park in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building have been found with a darre to dry cereals and to meal.
The building probably belonged to a villa of Rustica, an agricultural property, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented it in a glass virine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, believes Morscheiser.
The children were also involved in the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax tables, like the Roman pupils.
At the stand of the Roman thermals ZÃ¼lpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, bastle at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach Glasmosaiken and use a heavy wheat mill made of stone at the state of the natural centre Eifel Nettersheim to meal the flour for a flavored bread or a musli.
With the originally rebuilt Roman cars drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors sailed through the recreational park and also passed the impressive state of the urban gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter the Rhineland-Russia Roman Year 2014, which is supposed to remember the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations, as well as the Watchberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein und die Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and reminded of the Roman past of Wachtbergs.
For example, a Roman legionary will be told of his work on the upcoming Wachtberg, presenting plants as living monuments from the Roman era and presenting a funny lesson on international understanding between a group of "German" and enlisted Romans.
The Adendorf primary school devotes itself to the Roman theme within a week of a project.
With the Roman Week, the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be re-experienced.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will remember the discovery of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic burdens Western Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow for the economy.
Markets are obscured - and international companies go to distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic puts the economy of West Africa a severe blow.
The harvest is rotting on the fields that mines are abandoned and the markets are missing - the virus has hardly added to the region.
Some international companies are already far away.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economical crisis," judges the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuca.
Liberia is most severely affected
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
On the market only who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia has been hit at the hardest of the virus, here alone more than 600 people have been victim to the fever.
Recently, health authorities explained that the disease had occurred in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, thousands of others were killed.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Overall in the resource-rich countries, companies discontinue their business.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying the affected regions.
The local dealers and farmers also react: few merchants still leave their hometowns to get them back.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantines, among other things, the major cocoa and coffee beans in the fields were rotting.
The farmers don't dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Food becomes scarce
"The people are going to travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris's expert on the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables would rather stay home.
Therefore, the population gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
In the markets, the stock of basic foods, such as rice, drops.
At the same time, the region dependent on international companies threatens an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest risk is that international companies avoid the area over a long period of time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
Decisive is how far and how long the virus will spread.
In the case of investors, the impression could arise "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus invest," Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the straped state budgets of the States
The disease also burdens the government budgets of the countries concerned.
The Moody's rating agency fears that their budgets are strongly stressed by the high expenditure on the health system and also by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are already evident in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home because of fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced.
Protecting her 50th anniversary
The "TÃ¤nenwald" Berngau SchÃ¼tzenverein celebrates its 50-year-old founding festival from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the founding festival run from 12 to 14 September at the SchÃ¼tzenverein Tannenwald.
Planned on Friday, September 12th, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday at 6:00 p.m., the big bÃ¶ller shooting will be.
Then, in the large festival tent of the mood evening with the "StopfÃ¤lzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle cares for the music
Highlights on Sundays are the festival service and 9.30 in the parish church and the great festival at 14 o'clock.
In the afternoon there is also the distribution of the price of the Federal and Gauss Shooting.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 festive women with their Dirndln.
Female chapel is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert FÃ¼racker have taken over.
The original name "SchÃ¼tzengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" originated in 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment using exercise in room support and small calibration shooting".
In 1937, the NS regime caused the dissolution of the association.
Only 19 young men found themselves again in 1964, who took the "new" SchÃ¼tzenverein "TÃ¤nnwald" Berngau from baptism on 30 April.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a gunmaster through a difficult start time, in which it was primarily about finding a club place and installing the shooting operation.
In autumn 1965, the SchÃ¼tzenverein started in the "Leininger" guest house with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports guards, now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records purged every year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active protectors has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the Vereinslokal "Leininger" has no longer satisfied the requirements of a modern SchÃ¼tzenverein, the then board under the leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future home in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof HÃ¤rteis".
After a worktime of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988, pastor Strasser gave the ecclesiastical blessing for the new shelters.
One of the major highlights in the club history was certainly the 44th fast shooting, coupled with the solemn renown of the new fireplace in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the SchÃ¼tzenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary of the founding.
A BÃ¶ller group was established in 1995.
Joseph Schmalzl became BÃ¶llerreferent.
A major challenge for the "BÃ¶llerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian BÃ¶ller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of honorary work, the association members modernized the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngauer Hof last year, thus bringing them to the latest state of technology.
Elf teams in round competitions
The sports performance of the Protector Association can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air weapons forces, an air-pistol mandate, a sports pistool KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen to the district liga in 2013/14 from the Gauoberliga (highest Liga in the SchÃ¼tzenengau ANB).
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml rose from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as bock steaks, facing and kingball, club excursion and Christmas celebration have tradition.
With it the shelters are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time, after his right front tyre ran into round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said that his 14-member team was disappointed, but now concentrate on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We drive to Richmond and hope we can make it better there.
Stewart previously drove to a wall on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result," said Johnston and added, "it just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the slepper and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped out three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met and killed another driver at a ashes race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace, during an investigation to the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., which had entered the motorway during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities informed that the investigations for the cause of the accident will last for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken whether Stewart has to expect a charge.
The three-time champion was received with a great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12 position, Stewart was already forced into the first 10 and was temporarily on place four.
After a reboot in round 122, strawn Buschs
Cars with no. 18 except control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with stewart, both cars drove against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to place 21.
Dance-girled offspring searched
Just try out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Lieutenant Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to controversy.
Like many other associations, jazz groups in the TV Jahn create full-day education at the secondary schools.
After summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now young people are more searching for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight- to-two-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more actives, the whole would make much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreography," she says.
If you want to dance, you can sniff into the training hours between 17 and 18 or Friday between 17 and 18.30 in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, FreistraÃŸe 9, without obligation.
"The training begins regularly with a warming program," says the trainer.
Thereafter, various choreographers are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore about classics up to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, social affairs are not too short.
"We're going to eat, watch dance films and we've already stayed in the dance room," Lisa Neitzel reports.
In the group one could close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for its own motor development.
Whoever isn't that way, Jazztanz can also snuff in one of the other TV offerings.
Children and adolescents can always get into the classes in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who like Discofox, Slow Walzer, Vienna Walzer, Rumba, Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha and Tango can see and join.
Bulgarian prisoner protests throughout the country
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organized a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of claims to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and demand a return to the previous 24-hour shelfs.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continue to be informed by the Director-General for the Implementation of Criminal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov to the BNR.
The protest of prison workers is expected to be supported by members of the union association of employees of the Ministry of Interior.
Ukrainian Army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
In the eastern Ukrainians, the prorussian fighters continue to march.
After severe fighting, which supposedly also involveed Russian tankbataillons, the Ukrainian army has abandoned the airport of the Luhansk Rebellenhochburg today, Monday.
At the same time, the army informed that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeat of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership without mention.
Prorussian separatists shot off plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussian separatists, according to their own representation, have again shot off a fighter and two military helicopters.
Some 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donezk region, according to Russian agencies informed the rebels on Monday.
Coastal Guard vessels reduced
In addition, the rebels claimed to have cut two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Asovian Sea.
The Ukrainian border protection confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards had been injured, said a speaker in Kiev to the sender 112.ua.
Two crew members were deemed missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several localities in the Donezk area were under control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
Today, the Ukraine Contact Group meets in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an ambassador of the eastern Ukrainian separatists should also participate in this.
In advance, all stakeholders used their performances to publicly disclose their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned stationations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
The NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that the NATO is complying with the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO Chief, however, accused Russia of "a crack break" of the agreement.
"Today we have to see the reality that Russia does not view NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
Documents and statements from the Russian side "that they view us as opponents".
Strengthen NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced to want to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is needed," said Rasmussen in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to Russia and Ukraine, official data have agreed on new discussions on the settlement of their gas dispute.
The negotiations were launched for next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for the European Union to decide whether it also sends a representative on the discussions.
Because of the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks.
EU Energy Commissioner GÃ¼nther Oettinger had recently transmitted between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe covers about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks powerful word: Toll will come "very clear"
Now the Chancellor is clear about it again.
A free letter for all complicated details is not.
Continuous concerns from the CDU against the car toll have horrified the CSU at the same time.
Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel has spoken a powerful word for the introduction of a car toll after persistent resistance from her CDU.
"To make it clear: it is in the coalition contract, and it will come," said the party chief on Monday after meetings of the CDU teams in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not initially lay down a detailed model.
In the black-red government programme, it is called "definite parameters".
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and it is now being further worked on.
However, the NRW CDU persists on their no to a toll on all streets.
Merkel stressed that also Minister of Finance Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble (CDU) is in a constructive way involved in the discussions for a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also spoke with Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special." SchÃ¤uble had left a "spiegel" report uncommentarly on Sunday, his house checks its own concept of remunerating motorway investors with mature revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer warned against developing toll concepts against the federal minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The coalition treaty never assumed to pave all circle and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU-Country Chairman.
As far as it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk again about the subject.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDU-LandesverbÃ¤nde Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
Background are fears that a toll affects small border transport to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded for the toll criticism of CDU coalition loyalty.
The left views the plans as failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-Mut is dead," said party chief Bernd Riexinger of the "New OsnabrÃ¼cker Zeitung" (Montag).
"With the toll, the minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a fictitious obligation on all German roads that will start in 2016.
Inland car owners may not be additionally taxed according to coalition contract.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, the model may not disadvantage foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disturbance often wrongly diagnosed
A British woman said she thought that she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had to live only a few years after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffered from the charcot marie tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disturbances that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK informed that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weaknesses, an unsafe gang and crushed toes.
Patients also suffer from deafness or pain. The disease is unhealable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse in time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she suffered from Friedreich's Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children today, 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew that I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell down constantly and everything took longer with me.
I was never able to drive with the other children rolling shoe or skateboard and was often haunted at school because of my way of walking.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 she saw her health certificates when her doctor left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and paniced.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and that would slowly lose all my skills.
I made it all out with me alone and planned my own funeral.
She said, when she was 17, she became aware that her skills had not taken away as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and embraced me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, or you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life threatening.
After some genetic tests, their CMT was detected.
"When he told me what was CMT, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former troop exercise site
For nearly ten years, it has not been shot at the former troop training square in MÃ¼nsingen.
Nevertheless, each month, a killing ammunition appears in the heart of the biosphere area of SchwÃ¤bische Alb.
The granates are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be sprinkled on site.
In the case of the springs over the heartpiece of the biosphere area, an ear deceived crack halls.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the MÃ¼nsingen Army Exercise Station, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares large area has been the core part of the SchwÃ¤bische Alb biosphere area, which is open on 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax taxation of businessmen in Washington area increases with economic recovery
Recreation of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for businesses in the country slightly increased last year, while economic recovery accelerated, such a newly published study last week, and the companies in Washington area were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the revenue of $26.6 billion in 2012.
The public and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of declining 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenues come from companies.
Virginia earns the lowest tax revenue from companies by 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is based on a recovery of business real estate values, the researchers say that this year after the three consecutive years, this resulted in a 3.7 percent increase in real estate taxes with a growth rate of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the expiry appears to be true for Washington.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion to government and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase by 4.2 percent over a year.
However, the apparent recovery of real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as the real estate taxes amount to almost one fifth of the tax decisions of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland the following is happening: a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organisations who do not pay for property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other States offer.
The recent recovery of tax revenue by companies cannot only be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market
The data also appears to recover corporate revenue.
Companies in the region reported income taxes for state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took 1 billion dollars in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes into the same direction, local taxation for companies does not increase evenly in all three locations.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent to the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a lower average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has, at 6 percent in all three areas of office, the lowest income taxes on firms (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Trade at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower government and local corporate taxes are required and there is a better tax climate overall than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the next year, this law could reduce the State's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime it seems to be better for small businesses in Washington area, so they pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that most small companies are organized - increased by 20 percent in the District, Maryland and Virginia last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than total corporate taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country will probably continue this year, with an increase in general multi-fighting tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be behind when the Federal Government's expenditure reduction affects the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
Deutsches Bier, brown in Frankfurt's partner town Guangzhou - is the urgency of officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery would stay in our city," said Vice Party Secretary of the South Chinese Metropole, Li Yiwei, this week at visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
During the discussion, the functionary of China's ruling Communist Party repeatedly returned to this concern of the twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as canton in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, wasb Li.
Therefore, people also possess the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The hessian SPD president Thorsten SchÃ¤fer-GÃ¼mbel, who led the German Political Delegation, told the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it does not need much: good water, cereals and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party superintendent in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiated Mr. Li, he smiled to the host.
As a result, Guangzhou's functionar came up with sheep gimbles - but with red wine served for the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewery.
Tsingtao-Bier is brewed after the German purity command.
More Business
A second request from the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Parteichef Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but deleted in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," the local politician proved to be convinced.
"Business between our two cities is continuing to increase."
At present, travellers had to take the way over Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital Guangzhou is, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied SchÃ¤fer-Gumbel - Chinese Vice-Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate German expert, nicked in agreement.
maintained partnership
Guangzhou's simplified Vice-Participant hopes he will be able to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to office this year only after his predecessor had been transported from the office because of corruption claims.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the officials of Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is enforced by head of State Xi Jinping with hardness.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is most unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Prior to his office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top functioner in Fujian, where the automobile manufacturer VW builds a large work.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometres away Guangzhou belongs to those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year-old existence of the German-Chinese link was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis on the Perle River is almost as strong with its economic power as the whole Hessen.
The next year she wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "press the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her delivery to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter today hopefully showed that the 81-year-old comicer recovers from her disease.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We're pushing all the thumbs.
According to her mother, on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac discontinuation in a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, the Mount Sinai Hospital was introduced.
The doctors will deliberately keep them sedated and with close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "earth".
The reactions came from many sites, including in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental vacuum cleaners and rising wages
More strict environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners coming into trade from today onwards.
Like cooling cabinets and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer can detect central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, more stringent nitrogen oxide values are applicable in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolders: they receive a federally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon bought Twinch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported on Monday morning: the online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twice for $1.04 billion (970 million US$).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one had expected a acquisition of Twitch, but because it was far suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion thing decided, and the cooperation also appeared natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bouquets in games, a "YouTube for live games", says an insider.
The Twinch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better knower gives the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just so that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken somewhat boringly, a book example of an established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not done, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about this at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there sooner."
Another secret, honestly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to play sports rather than watching it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that seems to be looking at others while playing rather than taking the control console into hand.
It's one thing to watch a friend over the shoulder at 3 o'clock in the morning while she slides by Resident Evil, and something quite different to see a spider shooting him 20 times in Call of Duty's head.
All these games could just watch you.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so the view without own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast passages in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete all games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is not a game or humor virtuosis, its twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twinch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It is difficult to imagine that Twitch is integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video, as YouTube Twitch could have simply swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers.
As the Chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - sluck - as a spectator sport.
On the HÃ¼pfburg at the Burggartenfest, there was a lot to do on Sunday evening.
The organizers' concept was correct.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
In time, the initiation had to be stopped.
"That was angry," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt bead l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness in the day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun is coming from alone anyway.
This was already shown on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors came to the Open Air.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they have succeeded.
Around the supply levels on the Burggartenwiese it had made salt wedelers, but also guests from the nearer and further surroundings comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, wipped with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cool drinks - briefly: relaxation pure and enjoyment were demanded.
And that's all over the generations.
While the one slumped on ceilings on the extra-carred white sand on the beach bar, others labored on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the offspring on the hillburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when children were grinding, the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had to do all the hands full to become master of the Andrang and to enchant imaginative creations into the little faces.
The larger used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot crew furnished from salt beads.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 p.m., he poured down on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry ones.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
Therefore, a repetition of the big party in the next year is not opposed.
Although it is still necessary to work on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear in a first balance on Sunday to the folk vote.
It was annoying that he said that the initiation had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little powers.
The result: Some who had already paid were no longer on the site.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who tumbled in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox therefore broke off their appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a semi-proof sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt water due to a tyre pan.
"But next year they will be there," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that with bad weather.
However, the organizers have committed some mistakes that will still be forgotten for the first time but must be eliminated in the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organizers must criticize.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event side.
"You have taken you a little," said Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so close.
I think it's very good that some people don't just kick stupid, but also really try to put something on their legs.
Hut off!", writes Stephanie JenÃŸ to the Amula.
Now the organizers remain a year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
That's not what it expects.
Rather, the ready component is waiting to be used in the remarkable building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the creation of the TIRA Space Observation Radar, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47,5 meters than the old one.
But the size remains world record.
The last step to complete the new shell is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and taken with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is set up.
If the weather plays, the action will go through the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participants at the Ice-Bucket-Challenge are roasted
Isabelle Roberts from the UK shouted so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge went painfully.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she ran out of the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK was so much circled when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw was just standing," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is spilled over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't go, the jaw was stuck, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this too and smileed almost in the pants, but I had to get to the emergency recording.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was hospitalized to resign the jaw after the participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times to Facebook and Twitter.
Soon the castle clubs pull back on a strand?
Lastly, there were repeatedly dwarfs between the two Wolfratshaus Burgvereinen.
Now the boards think about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus Burgfreunde, introduced the project in the French GuÃ©delon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunds Wolfratshausen.
The views of the history of the Wolfratshaus Castle and the possible reconstruction seemed very different.
Now the two camps are moving to each other: talks about a common approach will soon be made.
This confirms the association boards Torsten SjÃ¶berg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called on Mr Piffl and suggested that we should stand together once," reports SjÃ¶berg.
In his view, all members of the two associations could in the future re-establish themselves.
So there are faster visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, the "creation and survival" of the terrain is at the forefront of the Burgverein around SjÃ¶berg.
Herbert Piffl, Second Chairman of Burgfreundy, was very happy according to his own information on the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in front of the Burgfreunds.
A new chairman is to be found in a member's meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club is currently counting around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have let the association activities rest out of respect first." This "thinking phase" was necessary to "consider how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go to the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunds could also make themselves a current mood picture within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself." He himself doesn't want to compete because he has his residence in Bad TÃ¶lz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The TÃ¶lzer wants to continue to work on the project "but very much.
The different positions on reconstruction are likely to remain in the eyes of Piffls in the next time.
He honoured Dimbath as "Missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Through a high participation of the population as well as volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "Also I was skeptical at the beginning.
But in the course of time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to move forward the project. It could be created a "all-configuration feature" for the city of FlÃ¶ÃŸer.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be fundable through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"I do not want to just throw the idea of reconstruction overboard for myself." He hopes that the Burgverein may move something on this point.
Their goal to document history first is "is important and good".
After that, you could continue to see.
Clever Ways to Save in Uni Learning Books
Since the cost of university learning books for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a smart saving idea.
He invented a loan system for students' books of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick fil A cookie," said Schroeder, 19 who visited Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college board informed that students spend more than $200 per year on teaching books and study material, however, that there were different cost-sustainable options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for the students.
Renting teaching books becomes more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Nobo Inc, who operates more than 250 university books, notified that the renting of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in the college book shops last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased in Campus books, according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the single one for the best deales.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only one-third of the price for which they are available in the Campus book shop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained from the specialized teacher book retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If your notes do not matter to any other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduating student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business".
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended that students ask their professors whether previous expenditure is allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting teaching books is worth considering if you treat them somewhat well, remember giving them back and do not want to keep the books after finishing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform on the provisions of the business in which you rent, including the penalties that, if applicable, apply to the writing of notes, underscores or signs of use.
Renter: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional teaching books are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering books can be very expensive.
Surely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination for books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check if the book is actually available.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college book shop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" did not become a casser
"The Expendables3 by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only $12 million of his budget of $70 million.
The "Sex Tape" film tailored to Cameron Diaz was only 14.6 million dollars at the opening week, while children's films such as "Drachent Thoms Lighted 2" also disappointed the revenues.
An article by the telegraph movie critic Robbie Collin suggests that in the children's films, the lack of quality in the movies could be the reason for themselves.
In 2014, Collin described as "the worst year" for children's films so far and described "Drachenzames lightened 2" as pure "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, in films for a slightly older target group it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for each summer film launch, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20th 2013 and the current year to at least 2000 line walls.
The results are based on the opinions of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equal to that of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Regisseur Jon Favreau, who currently works on Disney's jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
Unlike the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently achieved revenues with streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they concentrated too much on comics films and prophesied a "core melt" Hollywoods.
In the light of the current deterioration, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could quite contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash hits to be expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of the cash results as a simple "cyclic" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the largest summer at the cinema at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
A few years ago, when the second table tennis district class was deleted for the penalization of the lignage division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result: Whoever didn't get up, has gone.
For example, GÃ¶ttingen's highest class team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation avoided the descent, but in the next season only plays a fifth class.
Fourth-class Torpedos women remain, despite their grand marching into the regional liga.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony liga, as well as the boys of the SC Vienna.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve are in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga no longer represented GÃ¶ttinger Klubs.
With the women, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo-Zwei in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district headliga south.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB LÃ¶dingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Oberder SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC occur.
In the district liga as regional representative Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, red-white, the Oberder SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district supervisor of women begins at least in SollstÃ¤rke.
GÃ¼ntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Start in the district liga Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen.
With your nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district liga.
The district liga stamp of the SCW-Jungen - there is still starting Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two GÃ¶ttinger Kreisligents start with each nine teams.
In the West Staffel are the Red White II, the Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East-Staffel, satellite houses/WÃ¶llmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
The women's cruisliga consists of Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemels, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women's teams at circle level.
It is noteworthy that none of the six second classes will have to reach shoulder strength, here the innovative and driven circuit board will have to think.
Nato summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests of opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people met in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called countertop.
Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments for us on the weekend and has spoken to demonstrators who have traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWEY young bush hikers were secured with the rope winds after they were caught the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man broke up to their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Careful relatives called the police at about 20 a.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search troop from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found at about 23 a.m. near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had hurt at the knee and the man was crashed and had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flew out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable state with an ambulance.
Escalate government enemy protests in Pakistan
The around 1000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said the Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter resumed the radiation after well half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with stacks would have damaged devices in the editorial.
Dead or injured persons have not been reported.
The demonstrators demand the resignation of the head of government to whom they accuse election fraud.
The police informed that about a kilometer away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif it had come back to collapse of about 3,000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital details, a police officer was injured.
On the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to penetrate Sharif's residence.
They call for the withdrawal of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without waste time and apply without violence".
The Communication also stated: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state."
The escalating violence has caused anxiety about a military intervention that has been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have lasted since the day of independence on August 14.
Sharif refuses a resignation.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We will not go back without forced Shariff to resign," said Khan.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan proposes Sharif to have won the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri demands the resignation of central and provincial governments.
A transitional government will then reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are employed to protect the government district.
At first, the demonstrators had persisted peacefully before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them on the weekend to penetrate Sharif's residence.
HÃ¼tteldorfer after second season win on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 about Greed, a bitter week for Rapid took a comprehensible end on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team with the out in the Europe League had reached an intermediate depth on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and TorschÃ¼tze Steffen Hofmann, who met Green-WeiÃŸ in place three.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid on SiegerstraÃŸe Rapid has demonstrated the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with a success experience in the country game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership fullley of the sixteenth row in the 14th minute, set the way to victory.
"I thought I would take all the frustration from Thursday and snatch it under the late," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had hit the last time in a Bundesligaparty on November 13, 2010, that was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me this is something very special, I'm out of the rapid offspring," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pool blessure, scramble went from the left to the right side of the defensive and made his business very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this position mirrored.
He earned himself the gate, he has already done some assistants," commended Barisic.
Mannschaft shows character scramble also delivered the flank at 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally made the decision.
Because the guests could also have written for that.
"Thanks to God we have had some happiness today," also noted Schrammel, who thus played on the collapse of performance and result in the past weeks: "The results did not vote, but the playeric was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that one had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that played this season in this stadium".
The first three-pointer since July 26 has therefore proved that the team structure is intact to the relapse despite: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
For him no less delight: "That we have finally played again to zero".
A lot of work during the country break Also, the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpsberger there are several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger have given their startel debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget that," Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have recently been very stable."
The country break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and put a bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in his range.
One to which the break may be particularly located is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, passes over pain.
Just in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his change in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also achieved the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit from the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 via the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We probably also had a little luck, but at some point luck must come back to us.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He naturally urged to continue concentrated work: "You can't always see this black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as it has been presented.
But we shouldn't believe that everything is good now.
He couldn't dispute the significance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team I can help very much at the moment.
In some phases, they are sticking to me," said Hofmann.
GrÃ¶dig-Coach Michael Baur had little to pretend himself and his team.
He regretted the fast counterpart "from the category Zaubertor", as well as the regular gate of benefit in the 40th minute, which was unjustly recognized by arbitrator colleagues.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the gate in some phases.
We had too little conclusions.
Interior defensive Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started badly, but then we found pure and even made a gate.
Overall, there would have been more in it.
Under this whip, Ruh reigns
We showed a powerful tribe in our mystery of the summer series "My piece of RhÃ¶ner GlÃ¼ck" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still available in the district, the picture is the "feet rests" above sub-white browns.
A holpriger footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It passes by groups, basalt stones and basalt stone lakes.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, stands there.
Vital looks the natural monument, it stretches beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds with a size of more than eight meters to an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stomp suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only references to the history of names.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bishop'sheim archive and asked older people from under-white brown to learn what relationship it has with the whistling.
The result of his research remained the quite sober explanation for the name.
Thus, up to about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds have driven their animals from underwhite brown to the moistly redd and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the veiling guards, exhausted from the rise, should have rested.
Meanwhile, the area has gained its meaning back, because on the meadows actually weigh goat flocks again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When entering the stone collections, however, you should be careful, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for crossotters.
A hiking path leads from underwhite brown to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other routes are described, the direction of high-risings and invites you to an extensive hike.
Where's the waterburg?
However, a waterburg, which is searched for at our next task, is rather rare in the height.
The reflection in the grave already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district that could fit the building counterfeit.
Where is our "stuff of RhÃ¶ner GlÃ¼ck"?

After a few weeks of diving, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the EU, Matteo Renzi, has pursued the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as Chief of EU Foreign Policy against strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit last week, and she will be a successor to the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the governmental daily La Repubblica reflects the call for Mogherini as a favourite in the government team as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes that the long-term left-wing party will be calmed, because Mogherini is assigned to this, even in a moderate manner.
Against the Conservative Representatives with President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President-in-Office of Poland Donald Tusk, the predominant opinion in Rome is to make a political compensation.
Because the EU's head diplomat is becoming alternate of the Commission President Juncker at the same time.
The remaining consent of the EU Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would have barely called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini, known for her ambition, has proved to be in leading party offices for almost two decades.
The born Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began the PhD in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratic Di Sinistra (left democratics), which joined Margherita in 2008 with the Catholic Central Party.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
With the election in 2001 in the Party Council of Left Democrats, she entered the high party policy, working in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose leader she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO use in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troop quota, the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the USA.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Defence and European and International Affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his Foreign Minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the over 40 percent votes of the party in the EU's elections in May, then Federica Mogherini has a share in it, as stated in PD cruises.
The presidency in Brussels, the new EU foreign representative has too little diplomatic experience, so it lacks substance, is coined in the PD.
In Brussels, in particular by Poland and the Baltic members, there is a disgustingly realistic accent Mogherinis on the crisis in Ukraine and is dispersed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to transport Russian natural gas directly to South Europe under the circumference of Ukraine, which also serves the energy management of Italy.
After Renzi entered his term of office as EU Chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first national visit.
Photos that they showed with Putin at Shake hand were embarrassed in Brussels, as well as invited the Kreml Chief to an economic summit to be sent by the hamlets for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who has previously completed another training in the company.
The new staff will be active in four training professions: electronics (three trainers), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and procedural mechanisms (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas BÃ¼cherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form forest, Felix Domaier from Oberveechtach, Daniel worry-free and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees had previously attended primary schools or middle schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years as well as the trainers go to a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, an all-day migration and rafting on the Inn is on the program.
The company counts 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainers distributed over all annual courses is 27.
The socialists in France should "hold the mouth and put France straight," said Francois Hollande's most important allies.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist presidents whose cabinet conversion has been misapproved by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said with great applause.
As a satisfactory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a loosening of the Emmanuel Macrons, the new economic ministers.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "unified" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, spread sand into the drive, in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate Socialist Members and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far right-standing leader of the National Front, ridiculed the permanent tomb fights of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last for a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothing, but Prince Manuel Valls has no one, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will not survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the reputation of her party after a resolution of the Parliament and said that she was confident to come forth as a victor in preferential elections and would be ready for government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the judicial front was in front of the EU's elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of breaking into several rival groups before the end of Hollandâ€™s 2017 office.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not aim to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but the public opinion must feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could further deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, has, according to experts from the industry, conducted advanced negotiations for the acquisition of the current Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruises ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy expedition, while there are competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CRL.N).
A agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the conversations could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the Private Equity Society Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a share of 20 percent in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, since the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company in Miami operates 13 cruises on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand name Oceania and Regent, who jointly operate eight cross-ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues of 1.2 billion dollars for 2013, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and in the next few years it is expected for them because of strengthening the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice for cruise providers.
In January 2014, Prestige Cruises asked the US Regulatory Authorities for the stock exchange.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a recreational and cashinomic group under the control of the Malaysian billionary Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested 1 billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP a share of 8 percent in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise, according to the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises Stock Exchange, have more than 82 percent of the passenger capacity for American cruises.
Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China on the day following the election.
A peking-faith group swinged close to the Chinese flag.
On Sunday the Standing Committee of the National Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the management election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee which is expected to be occupied with peking-faith members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and prompted pro-democracy activists to observe their threats and lame the Hong Kong financial square with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leadership fears that the call for democracy extends to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which presented China's domination over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum to the election procedure in the special administrative region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in.
Li's survey is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Permanent Committee of the Law Commission, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be asked during the course of the day.
Student activists announced to gather in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the headquarters office.
By the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain did not provide any democratic elements.
Putin demands Kiev to take "state talks" with the eastern Ukrainian
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, Russian media reports demanded that the Ukrainian government fight against the separatists in the eastern part of the country and start directly with negotiations on the "statement" of the afvallige region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the eastern Ukrainian territory under control of the separatists would be a part of Russia, but that its status towards Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiewer Government to negotiate at a high level with the pro-Russian oppositions, however, fits with the strategy that he has apparently pursued since the start of the outbreaks of five months ago: help for the separatists in occupying areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government in order to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossija factual independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with the State TV channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to conquer the areas held by separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had anchored the Ukrainian peninsula of Crime on March 18.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently referred to the land taken as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term that reminds of the pre-revolutionary glossary time of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who hope in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on the 26th Oct and while government groups of civil communities in the areas held by separatists are attacking rapid peace talks "in their illusions" reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to start extensive discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the Southeast Ukraine in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to state in the context of the larger autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to scatter fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin Speaker to correct the "Fehlination" of Putin's comments underlined the leadership claim of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, unlike the direct announcement of the Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty connecting the Donezk and Luhansk regions in the eastern Ukrainians, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict gave a wide majority for the remainder in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats at international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, so giving the Kreml de facto control over an area that connects the Russian state territory with the Crimea.
The five months ago annected Black Sea Peninsula is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and mollusks that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed, in his speech to initiate the Office on 7 June, that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should be taken into account in addition to the Constitution, with which the respective territories are given greater control of their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arms and sparkling Moscow are provoked.
Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye height followed a further penetration of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks crossed the previously peaceful region along the Asovian Sea into the eastern Ukrainians.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the battle, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officers, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, the control of Nowoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been made to fix Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Nowoasovsk and narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We're just in front of a point where there's no back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not decide to take concrete action, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to retreat from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank colons and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donezk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Reporting on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers included by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parachute hunters who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, informed Lysenko on Sunday.
Nackfotoscandal to Australian Promise and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no healing about his anger about hackers who probably stole naked images of his fiancÃ©e Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who the A promise from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have appeared in a hacking candal to promis on the Internet.
The Hacker responsible for this is probably equipped with 60 naked photos from Lawrence, Star from "the tributes of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
From Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were supposed to be public due to an iCloud gap.
The list contains 101 prizes.
Noblest who had been engaged with Grecko last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
According to a news site, Grecko, currently in New York, said that the hack was "shameful" and that the affected people felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-girlfriend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she is located above without a pool.
The film works of Palmers include "Liebe is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments about the minced pictures.
A representative Lawrence said to TMZ: "It's a terrible injury of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "To post hacked images from a cell phone is nothing but the sale of Hehlerware."
Just legally, the further spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and hikers attended the 8th cycling on the GroÃŸen Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the "Help for Crebs" association.
The tour, which was a torture for one, was an easy training for the others.
In one, however, all agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For for the first time in his life, the boss of the Oberursel Brauhaus traveled yesterday by bike to the fieldberg.
For good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cater there, especially as the attendance on the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg in favour of the "Help for Crew Kids" (Frankfurt) also personally gave him valuable knowledge.
A great thing.
"I know now I can do that - fine!"
Small breaking on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel City Parliament, many of the 718 participants were tormented to mountains yesterday in the early dawn and came near the exhaustion, but happy on the Plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier for others to overcome the well 11 kilometres long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
For example, Norman DieÃŸner.
The green politician from the circle day - red dress, red bike - made a little more on understatement at the start ("Every amount of professionals, there's the destination!"), but then proved to be half a professional at the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press speaker of Oberursel City, who had made his way along with Frank GrÃ¼neisen.
For the two triathlets, the "Feldberg-Raddern" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "There is Charity, there we are happy with - we would have made an exit today," Kuhn said.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) was driven down to Oberursel in the morning to get back to the height.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swung home in the saddle in the morning at 9:00, "make" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Fun also had "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosks, bike tours via the Feldberg are simply included.
He had hit his 6.5 kilo wheel for 40 minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says that he is an ambitious racer.
He must also be, because he was on his way with the "fixie wheel", which are also racing bikes, but without switching...
Not only did the 20 hikers, who rose up to the summit over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz, but also a jogger who drove a car tyre with weights on a cord.
Mountain Guard Doctor Professor Volker Lischke, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad with his team, said: "Then I know" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special slide trail, only that he holds the sleeve to himself". So the man is in a way his own sleeve dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never - were sent to the route in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 p.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10:00.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Raddles on the Great Feldberg", gave the launch commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that the route to the fieldberg can be locked up to the safety of the participants.
