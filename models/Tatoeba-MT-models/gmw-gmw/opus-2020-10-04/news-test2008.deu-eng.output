Food debt to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 euro area countries, the inflation rate was higher than expected in November – after 2.6% in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1% was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have dropped from only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British and Canadian notes bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the Leitzsins. According to their assessment, the reduction in interest rates would favour the rise in raw materials prices and the slight decline in unemployment the creation of an inflation spiral.
The ECB aims to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent market.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the coupling mill: Inflation must be "declared" to exclude later needs of action.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record level in Germany in November; in Spain the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area is responsible for increasing food and energy prices.
The MATIF white notations increased by 88 percent, and the course for soya beans has also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also had a significant tendency in 2007.
The world market price for raw oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price reached nearly 100 US dollars per cap of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but in 2009 it is expected to decrease to 1.9%.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts have a 3 percent inflation rate, but the average annual rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup orthodox government crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathists has grown considerably until the beginning of December. The party has been the largest base camp since 2002, while the agreement for the socialists according to Gallup has reached a 13 percent low point that has never been seen.
In the case of the party-faith voters, the difference is evident thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 percent) are compared to one fifth (20 percent) agreement for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entrance barrier: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party selectors has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the overall economic mood has further deteriorated – never before, the proportion of those who judge the economic situation of the country as "exceptably bad" has been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it to be "very bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population are expected to further deteriorate the situation; only one tenth goes from a improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December revealed that 71% of respondents - a historical high - considered the work of the Prime Minister as "but bad as right".
Thirteen percent of the respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of the supporters for Viktor Orbán represents 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% mistrust against the Fidesz Party Chief.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of people who believe that one could handle discontent with the Prime Minister even without changing government.
After the unrests last October, 35% of the government's and government leaders still voted for the remainder, this share is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the Volksabstimmung, 60 percent replied that they would "participate with certainty" and another 20% would "probably" their votum.
Compared: would parliamentary elections take place on Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the urns "with certainty", another 15% would believe their participation "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the vote would be foreseen.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practical fee, and 84% against the hospital daily fee.
Translated to the group of people's votes "with certainty" would even amount to 81, 84, and 89 percent of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees.
Also the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost one fifth
The hypermarkets in Budaurs trade area also maintained this year the average price increase of 16% of last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets have been "of which" in the last December, the inflation has not fallen substantially, compared with the already high, previous level of output.
However, it certainly deteriorates consumers that what they had paid far below 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF margin by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year level, but the prices for putenbrustfilets, Nuss and Mohn have risen strongly.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were 1kg babes for 139 Forint.
There was no competition-related price breakdown in the product to below 200 Forint.
Also surprising was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink, including pound, cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Alsoan was the most expensive, and Cora was the most affordable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" cart compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan each have increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was 1.206.00 Forint, but the rate of VAT increased at last Christmas.
This is exactly the case: it seems that the houses of goods were not able to decide exactly what price margin they should apply in the individual articles, as the effects of price increase on consumer behaviour were indispensable.
(If the distributor plans the circulation speed of a product badly, it may fall by significant profits in the price margin which is based on the traffic intensity.)
Measuring tax-conditioned the tendency of the "Napi" cart in the past year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost at 1.630.00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest was a price increase of 1.284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic increase in price, the price of daily consumption in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: in some basic foods, the Statistical Office established a more than 30% reduction over 12 months.
So in about meal also with eggs.)
However, if one looks at the "Napi" cart, this seems almost impossible at the last, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has risen by little more than 10 percent in the worst case.
Obviously, meal suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they could turn the drastic price increase to the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets are not complaining; it is constantly reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three goods houses no longer look at the prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, sustainable foods go across the shop tables in pallets.
Wednesday morning morning there were endless snakes in all three goods houses at the cassation when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so that many multis complain that they could not even achieve the planned sales, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are spared
Today, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals due to improper treatment with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not precisely relevant to the contamination of infections, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places the disinfectants are also spared.
A MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed in the traumaatology department of the János Hospital.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a severe accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a severe car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. Since then, an important operation has not been done because of the bacterium still in the patient's body.
By December 10, 1094 infections caused by multiresistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multiresistant pathogens were safely registered in hospitals, but the dark figure is expected to be higher.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bears about a third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as nitrogen inflammation, manile inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) usually react well to antibiotics, they are well healable.
However, if the funds are dosed too high or inadequately used, the well-reacting antibiotics resistors come from the well-reacting bacteria, which are rapidly spreading in hospitals under the appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weak, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in elderly patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the hospital daily.
If the infection cannot be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is not the only place where it is not sought.
Resistant to Antibiotics
"Some patients are isolated, the nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are investigated at MRSA during their delivery to the hospital, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample withdrawals too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the conditions and circumstances currently prevailing would be unfavourable to prevent the emergence or spread of the multiresistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and age homes, the spidals should examine the patients supplied and isolate MRSA infected immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not practiced so often in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there is no grant for this investigation on the part of the public health insurance scheme.
Therefore, most cases will not come to light until the patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
From the European Union, there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and imaging diseases.
Antibiotics therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary so that no resistance to the means can be found, but this directive is not always adhered to by hospitals.
Among the ambulant, or underlying patients, microbiological samples are even more rare, says Karolina Böröcz.
The disinfectants are separated
Scientific evidence demonstrates that MRSA is most commonly transferred from one patient to the other by the nursing staff.
This is why it is important to wash hands, or to wear gloves and masks, but there are also significant shortcomings in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted through druppel infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patients to the home hospitals.
The rooms are often overfilled, the beds are barely ranked together, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological viewpoint.
As Karolina Böröcz continues to note, there is unfortunately even in the less well placed hospitals that there are few nursers, many patients - all factors that are just beneficial for the emergence of infections.
Such infections are apparently much less common in this area, or can be stopped by the further spread of the pathogen where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government Programme against MRSA
Handling MRSA infections causes the health insurance enormous costs, so they are fighted everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its impediment in the government programme, was observed.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data proves, the tendency of MRSA infections in England has declined.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multiresistant pathogens (including MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Doodlener politician was not drunk
In the case of the car accident with fatal outcome caused by the head of the XXII District, the official opinion is now available.
The now resigned police chief of the XXII District, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press speaker of the Budapest Supreme State Attorney on Friday after the official opinion was submitted.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he took control.
The former chief of the police took his own car in the XXII district into the Kossuth Lajos Street and crossed a 55-year-old man crossing the road at an unidentified place.
(Laut StVO, however, this is not a milder circumstance - the steward has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the Zebra Strip, degradation.)
The pedestrian is injured after his delivery to the hospital.
According to police reports, the steward suffered a shock, then put back his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest prosecutor has initiated its investigations to the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Other EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements in Budapest in total of EUR 400 million.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund in 2006.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan contract is also intended to be used for budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million is later decided under the extension of the credit contract.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The metro line 4 was also spoken at the meeting.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original treaty and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The credit interest is EURIBOR-related, the loan is provided by the EIB with an amount of 8 years, free of charge.
Bulgaria, the EU's Property-Paradies
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fantastic - all of Europe looks at the most rarely mentioned Balkans.
What, where, and who buys the EU's cheapest market, which becomes more rapidly expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is no doubt the most desirable patch for property purchases in the Eastern European area, with cheap ski apartments and sea houses.
Between the mountains, the Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular regions, albuma, the "Gold Coast", the "Sound Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, however, property around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly demanded.
According to Re/Max Analysts in Bulgaria, the country’s interior also attracts investors earlier or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favourable Russian area have more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - trade and office areas offer highest yields.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradise, thus attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter season in the other two seasons.
Therefore, forward-looking investors are already buying in large-scale style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also stakeholders from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the Ski Areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to relocate buy either revitalized property by 50-100.000 euros, or downcoming houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are greatly written, but also the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed in December under the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of businessmen investing with the objective of a medium- to long-term value increase.
Real estates in the capital become more expensive, however, due to the ever growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but over the past five years there has been a 21% increase in prices annually.
The cost of real estate prices is far higher than the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Minister of the Environment, Gábor Fodor announced, experts' meetings ended on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 is continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are consulting the roadmap of Bali, where the emission reduction measures are set for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
At present, a strong debate between industrial and developing countries is in progress.
The US has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate on concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether the industrial states are willing to support both financial and technologically in addition to the reduction of emissions.
A agreement on the support of developing countries has also been reached.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, which is expected to follow the UN Global Environment Facility (GF) as read in the Piac és Profit.
Hungary's six percent
Minister for the Environment, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by 1990 values), whether the Agreement was successful after 2012, or not. The Union would even be willing to use a reduction of 30%, provided that other major industrial states in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to comply with their obligations according to powers and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the countries joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU, with its 15 Member States at that time, had already committed to a minimum of 8%.
The objective for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87, which the country will fully meet, as read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The use is high on Bali – in any case, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a renewed international emission reduction system, whose significance was also highlighted by the IPCC, the international Nobel International Committee on Climate Change, awarded by the Peace Nobel Prize, in its recent report.
This would delay emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army throws on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have been loading videos about operations conducted against the Taliban in the network since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The recordings, which are rotated on helmets, are controlled at the air weapon support point in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political Embassy Inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFI) in Iraq have own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the people about the actual objectives of foreign interventions.
Such published propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, according to defence expert Gordon Mackenzie at the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message in themselves, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Advertise Americans with game
But the army must also fight against amateur recordings, which, besides the carefully processed censored recordings, also create into the network - such as those who show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are spoken at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
From the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, many videos have already been loaded on the platform, but this "generation" has only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans, however, advertise something else, with the free downloadable shooting game "American Army", in which the player can blow into the soldier's skin in the context of a more or less life-sustainable simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministry
The Minister of Labour, Monika Lamperth, is not ambiguous: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organises a working conference where her employees can make coffee and pogatsche the year 2007.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other magnificent Christmas with Tombola or attack in the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - that's how the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already collected the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held today in the defence resort, but it is not expected to be the staff of the Ministry.
At the "Christmas' Christmas celebration" children are donated by fallen soldiers, at the "Missions celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides about 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport are striking.
The 4.32 million Forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economics is held in the house of the future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola release.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a festival.
The hall rent was 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 loaded guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited at another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the responsible.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay a rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
On request from [origo], it was told that there was no ball dress or suit obligation on the ball.
The Ministrys of Health, Work and Self-Management are preparing for Puritan celebration each.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth officially invites her employees to the conference for the annual hearing, not for a Christmas celebration.
It is expected that some 180 guests - so the press department - will only receive coffee and pogatsche - the celebration will take place with 350,000 forint.
Minister of Self-Administrative Gordon Bajnai, with his colleagues, will simply insult in the Aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas celebration in its own festival room, which is expected to be 436 employees.
The expenditure was measured by 2,500 Forint per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent attacks.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the staff of the PM have celebrated this way each year.
However, there will not be a proper party vote - not only because of the Minister's official speech but also because the celebration was set for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites on 20 January to a New Year's Reception, the Christmas celebration of the Ministry this time.
One hundred guests are invited to Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the resort, the expenditure is measured with 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception to which foreign diplomats are only accredited in Hungary.
The receptions that are organized each year begin traditionally with a short speech by the Minister and sound with reluctant smuggling.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or at the Ministry of Education.
Questions about the cost of the Christmas celebration were not available at the Press Department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration held in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
On Friday, the League unions and the Hungarian union Federation form their coordination committee for the strike that begins on Monday indefinitely.
On Saturday a summit of protests will be held, on Monday - on the day of the vote on the Health Insurance Act - the establishment of work begins.
Streik-related, significant traffic disabilities are expected as rail transport is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also striking up to 13 o'clock.
Details on strike on Monday will be published jointly on Friday afternoon by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation.
It is also set up a LIGA - MOSZ strike committee responsible for the coordination of actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a summit of protests will be held, and from Monday on Monday all organisations who have joined the strike will set down the work for an indefinite time, provided there is no agreement with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees shall meet to consult on the further action.
On the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that the health insurance law will only be voted in the later evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes starting on Monday will require considerable traffic disabilities: the railways will set their work for an indefinite time, the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will be silent in the morning.
At the same time, there will be many places for motorway locking one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is being updated on the Liga website on an ongoing basis.
Some organizations announced strikes at an indefinite time, others are planning a temporary reduction of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement on sufficient services between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the railways, although more and more people are travelling by the train, just around the Christmas Days.
According to previous reports, the BKV from operating start up to 13 o'clock, at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 o'clock, the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy lay down the work for four hours, and the Teacher's laboratory, e.g., called the Democratic Teacher's Association to 2 or 2-8 hours of strikes.
The Hungarian Physical Association strikes at different times across the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Trade Union of the Health and Social Workers, a suborganisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of the Trade Unions, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and presents a new concept of social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Appeal number three states that the claimed professional groups are already allowed to access the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, did not accept the subdivision offered by the Ministry of Transport and now demands a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analyzing Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard founded this August with the support of the "Motion for a Better Hungary" increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The "risk warning report" of the Institute states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "degradation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and non-gypsies population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provocation of such a dispute, says the Research Institute.
As reported, this is regarded as a failure from the political leaders: "Public people have left the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma Hungarian accord".
It is assumed that this would strengthen the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard would have been seriously damaged, not least due to the enormous attention of local and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been constantly upturn, so that since summer 2007 several organizations called "national self-defense association" have been established.
"These groupings are common to define themselves as civil organisations, while they openly praising their members to prepare their defence tasks - sometimes armed - (catastrophe protection, national defense, order guard), calling on the independency of the police, the army, or the state itself," said it.
And further, that all happens in accordance with that method that tries to tear different political and party-based attempts as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association is therefore not merely a means of circumventing legal barriers that could arise in the course of the registration at court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk increase in relations with the neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been quoted in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, so some ultranationalist politician of certain neighbouring countries see the formation of the Hungarian Guard confirming his own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-East Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose founding was announced in August 2007 by the Legal Extreme Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian wardrobe, the Roma mass excursions took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents immediately for the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organisation of "national protection" is.
In their view, in the past 17 years, a real "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria was evident, but the state remained decisive and indifferent - so Political Capital.
And further, the initiative would have triggered a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As has been said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to set up their own guards for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, says the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said on request of the news office: The risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published, and risk-changing trends should be discernable, the public opinion is informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are legally regulated, so that the practice of rediscovering the working days has now established around the holidays, but the next year is less such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood as "Feather Day".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and unemployed days.
Workless days are mostly church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the last one alone so that the New Year's holidays can rest.
All year round, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The Days of State are the 15th of March, which recalls the Revolution of 1848, and the 23th of October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the state foundation, celebrated on May 1st, we remember our dead on November 1st and 2nd.
In addition, there are two holidays at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall into a weekend, the practice of "workday shift" has proved itself in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the extended weekends is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finalised, the Minister of Labour has been defining its own regulation for many years.
The legislation shall apply equally to all employers and workers, to public servants and officials of the public service.
Except for companies and institutions where the operation is continued without interruption, also on holidays.
Today, the working order is only brought about through the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24 on, the life of this country remains formal, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Comparison of Time, or take the specially lifted holiday.
In the next year, more holidays will fall to the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so that there will be less rediscovery during the working days than this year.
The calendar will first be put around the day of work "on the head" so that people can stay at home at the same time as four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 will be a day of rest.
The second rediscussion is related to the holiday on October 23th: On Saturday, October 18th, you will have to finish the Friday, October 24.
However, the end of the year will be restless in the sign of the holidays, after everything is lying and standing from December 24th, even if the New Year falls on a Wednesday.
Six disgusting little things to annoy workmates
E-mails that we forget to send off, language messages that we never receive - harmless lies that no longer notice us: They bring "color" into everyday life at the workplace.
The question is simply whether you are accustomed to these small inconveniences or if you are better facing the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings consciously for other angry situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I've forgotten to justify you that someone called from the marketing department," says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it good again by perhaps calling at the marketing department and reciting, forgetting to distribute the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before being confused in embarrassing excuses, consider what can truly be done to his colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
borrowed something that doesn't belong to yourself?
There's hardly a bit more nervous than when you're taking a document, office accessory, or the phone, but it's not there.
Last night the hedge was still on the desk - is it gone this morning?
Or is the lost believed ballwriter discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without question, there should be no loan from the colleagues, because they are rightly angry when they find that something has gone away.
So don't put any envelopes or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more if you need it urgently.
What about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a tracquel that has already been put into the world.
Who with whom, what did?
Where and why?
If possible, you should not bind the information (or suspicions) about the private life of colleagues to everybody's nose!
And if anyone opens up and tells us his innermost secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to keep silent like a grave instead of just disposing of the present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Without reason sickly reported?
If you call in the office to report yourself sick on painful headaches because you just feel unwelcome, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one: your own work, unrecoverable work, projects with fixed dates, now the colleagues have to do rather than yourself.
So don't play the colleagues badly!
If you know in the morning that you will not get to the office the next day, or that something could come in between, because you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss will be confronted with the absence unexpectedly.
Summer, Kitchen, Telephoneing
You're just deepened in your work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud gig of your colleagues?
Will you hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
You should not nerve the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (which you pass over their heads), trampling, constant shaking, or nailing.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not completed in time, one has forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not seek the debt of your own forgetility with others!
If possible, do not speak to the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to confess his mistakes and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to fix the mistake, or how to recover the failing, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training suits and slips: Comfort for home, but in the office nothing has lost!
Not even then, you should dress yourself in such an army if the workplace actually allowed it!
Don't become too sloppy - you should respect both his colleagues and yourself so much that you dress yourself in the office - if you want, also pretty and elegant!
It all wants to make it right - or how one becomes uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the all-morning stew.
From the radio a strange melody sounds: the sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds to mr2.
The local music scene hasn't spoiled us for a long time with a qualitative electropop.
But now you can even see the stew differently when you hear Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting production from the local digital underground scene slowly contributes to a change in the overall image, and even if the garage rock is "in" with its guitar quitch, the local electropop proves: there are new ones under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, even musiced in Yonderboi band before he - perhaps because a host house does not endure two pilots - began to get his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merged elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, did not create it until the request to compose the soundtrack to a film was made to him (e.g.
"Szezone" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which was initially in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ran their first album from 2002 among the top 50 home albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was the nearly only trendsetter in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band "trendy" were, but nobody was interested whether they liked to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open them new ways, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Baláz's Zságer was still travelling with another band.
The airy, flying imagination would also be in order, but besides the essential character of music, the - the spirit of time and the trends - loud guitar, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, working with the band "The Puzzle" in England, presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - the newest mr2 Petůfi, sending pop music from early to late, has successively put the earworm to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So it's all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked at Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "Music" does not mean much to me.
I think there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercially and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be mild and non-speaking, but they can also only be produced for the sale that makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motif.
The listener's reception will also work in accordance with this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B.C.: abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or Twens going on concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happens around them much more attentively because they also consider them to be part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many listen to your music?
B.C.: Of course it's a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we have never composed for the market.
With us, the music does not originate for a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is mostly noticeable in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn it is only in the irregular changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed one thing: If you want to make it all right, you're not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the west.
B.C.: We don't really go his way, sometimes completely apart from trying to interpret this in our music again and again.
We rather see ourselves as a team player who trust in the musical presence of the other person and let them unfold.
At first, of course, our work was inevitable with the work of Yonderboi, since several of us came out of his band and made another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petůfi, "Wings of Love" is the first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously staged with a somewhat more popular style towards a wider audience?
B.C.: We had no plans to write a hit, which was then supposed to be a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be a finale of the album with which we wanted to solve the sound care and the more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just her, what was the guiding principle?
B.C.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to assemble the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
Thus, the six-party choir has been created - i.e., Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Eniků Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we have then baptized apathetic "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls have it?
B.C.: The number was already in the instrumental version for a longer time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still needs something.
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody in the same night, later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically on the hive and terrifying spontaneously.
I can remember that I was quite electrified at that time, but it has already required the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert one had the impression that the girls would be in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, sing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their song is not only accompanied by the music.
They also stood on the stage behind.
Is it intent?
B.C.: The fact that they were behind was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not deliberately want to give them solo rolls.
In the number, it is also about forgetting his ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where it is going, we simply allow these certain wings, the wings of love to lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came about.
hvg.hu: What was the most earnest song?
B.C.: In fact, there was nothing at all in musical work, there were more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert club, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove wanted to work no longer, but gradually, everything joined up as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B.C.: This is changing with the concerts running and also now where I have the album "lossen".
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
fraudulent agents risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Soilless fraudors
Thus, his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French Bankenriese Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came by almost five billion euros for its sake.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it the same way to his colleagues, in addition, was certainly not incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He's more psychically weak," was to hear from the mouth of his supervisors who showed him to the police.
However, as Kerviel’s statements show that the French media, for example, published the Le Monde daily, he was a person who achieved profits of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year with its businesses.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In summer, he succeeded in earning half a billion euros in the US crisis.
In fact, he had already experienced the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February there were first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as income weakened customers or those who had previously had repayment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kervel didn't believe this and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had earned up to 1.6 billion euros.
"Soon when I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain this," Ker much admits and continues that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has faked documents, so that he can't be found on the silly.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex stock exchange was gradually interested in his businesses.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to flee?
Hardly.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after his graduation at the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant of a broker and in 2005 he became a self-employed broker with an annual salary of $90000.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others would.
"Soon at my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Allianz he earned much by setting half a billion euros on the price losses of this title at the London bombing attacks.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, let's leave you.
"That's like a snowball," he said to the policeman.
But the bosses supposedly knew of everything, or knew it.
"As long as I earned money, you closed your eyes."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the great blow came.
On a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they come to him?
He was suspicious of a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to watch him in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday a total of nine development programmes, allowing the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
It is about half the total that Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to get approximately 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies win money to innovative enterprises.
Companies should thus gain finances for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the previous EU funds acquisition, the Czech Republic is one of the least successful among the new candidate countries.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20 years of imprisonment for ex-presidents
On Thursday, a Vocational Court in Nicaragua confirmed the 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced for financial fraud of $100 million (about 1.8 billion crowns) in 2003.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguan Metropolis.
Whether the former Head of State (1997 to 2002) is behind this Central American state, according to the news agency AP, is currently unclear.
According to the Chairman of the Appeal Court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detention officers, whether to leave Alemán his sentence at home, or whether he has to go to prison.
A court confirmed four years ago that Alemán had regularly postponed money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his election struggle in 2001.
The budget is by:
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which has been adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (from this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could not allow him to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the question of mistrust against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Deputies approved this traditionally little respected, yet most important law at all silence.
This is paradoxically.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but is covered by the government's and opposition's power struggle.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, so they devote more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting for the public than nuclear figures.
The government budgets suffered from three weak points in the past social-democratic governments, which the budget cannot be disposed of for 2008 at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure compulsory to law, not only of pensions, but also of social expenditure, which decided the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, except for taxes, taxes and bank loans, used to provide additional sources of investment, often uncovered debt debts, which they owe to their councils in excess.
In recent years, they have managed to pay these debts by massive sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks that they received in the context of privatisation from the state.
Now this source is already invaded.
As far as we only observe official and verifiable facts, we find that:
our economy has been through a growth phase for a number of years, like the rest of the world, which the ČSSD is fameless.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to correct public finances.
Instead, these governments owe the state even more.
Other countries, apart from some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, which is primarily attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries that are at least threatened by poverty, seen in the global scale.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which have, unfortunately, been exuberantly exposed in recent years.
Even though it has been successful to delete some of the unsinnige populistic expenditure adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no shift of pension age and pension reform in the next time, practically any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will remain but pure management.
It is only easy to be exaggerated when it is said that ruling politicians are going to become officials who divide the majority of tax revenues mechanically to pensions and social expenditure.
This year's budget can therefore not be a revolution, but can only stop the penetration of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns planned for 2008 would be very unnecessary if previous governments had not spent what was going on over the past decade.
If we do not want it really to be that of ruling politicians to become pure administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can incorporate taxes and fees in order to wish rest when preparing further reform laws.
Only these allow the gradual enforcement of a balanced government budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the UK, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight jointly against the crisis in financial markets.
In this way, more than $100 billion will be granted auctions on monetary markets.
On these auctions, the banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, American Fed sends $40 billion on auction, another 24 makes it easier for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time after the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of each country agree on such a coordinated approach to defence or to reduce the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is to eliminate the greatest difficulties in the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl from the consultant Economic Outlook Group in a report for his customers.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion, especially in the United States, because of non-service loans.
Analytics are expecting further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have really been afraid of what can be done than decided to do this," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and cause the American economy to fall into a recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to cut down the LIBOR, the London Interbank interest rate used in the loan between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid of lending money to each other, although the US, Canada and the UK central banks had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting the Agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the USA.
Klaus: Discussions of the ecologians are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus reaffirmed the problem of global warming.
The criticism now refers to the final international conference of the UN on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he stated that the debates of the ecologians were infamous.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which constitutes a strange mix of government representatives and those of non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric which it accompanys, and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is only substitute for a real solution to present problems," said Klaus.
The Czech president stressed in the idea of his book that his topic was very important to him and that he was so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often meet on caricatures of my views."
So now interested people could read his attitude without any distortion.
Klaus reminded that he was not a climate toologist, but he felt that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He was ultimately academic, capable of understanding and assessing professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and also being economic operators.
As a main statement of the book, he mentioned the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no consistent opinion among scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and thus no threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are overequivocally, unsuccessful and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers it unacceptable to impose uncertain views on others as having experience in totalitarian systems, that he considers it a dangerous limitation of freedom.
He repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who did not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600000 drivers missed the time limit to exchange their old driving licence, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for exchange so that the authorities can make it possible to issue a new driving licence until the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers are on the roads without valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive any more have changed their driving licence.
While small towns report a strong decline in interest in the furnace exchange, the offices of the capital are overflowed with applications, and the interest in exchange grew this week.
The city administration completes around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not changed their driving licence yet.
The exhibition of a new driving licence lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to request the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Car drivers who do not create the prescribed exchange until the end of the year and leave without valid driving licence are threatening a penalty from January.
The wrongdoer pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
But the police can also make it use with an admonition during the transgression.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
After previous information, the person of the community can also be imposed on a penalty that does not go at all.
He could threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the offices to let mildness act and, at most, impose a penalty of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, nobody wore a thousand crown penalty.
The driver's license is a document where everyone can decide whether he wants to own it or not.
It is not a person's ID, which everyone must have, and one which is valid.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipality office or to send him there by subscription.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are invalid.
However, drivers must gradually also exchange other types of driver licenses.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years for exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other drivers' licenses.
Judgment reduces penalties for detectives ally with Berdych
The former policeman Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who were accused of having made joint business with the band of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years of imprisonment.
This was decided in a judicial judgment by the Prag Oberlandesgericht, which reduced its penalty by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the Office for the Fighting of Organized Crime threatened 14 or 12 years.
Contrary to the present judgment there is no possibility of appeal, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused of this matter, but first of all the first sentence is before him.
In other processes, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He can't be condemned too much more.
In January 19 people were mainly guilty of participation in ravens, the Oberlandesgericht negotiated today the 16th vocation of them.
Most accused parties argued from the outset with the reasoning that it was a constructed case.
According to the Middle Bohemian District Court, members of the police submitted information from police sources to Berdych criminals, covered various robberies, and helped members of the bands to refrain from prosecution.
For this, the band left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the spoil.
The prosecution concerns crimes of the bands from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robbery, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for official announcement and unauthorized possession of weapons.
During domestic investigations, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser telephonic tube, and a machine pistool.
According to the claim, the bands have enriched by millions of crowns through their robbery.
Except for nearly 20 men in this procedure, courts of Berdych and a number of other legally recognized as guilty for further ravens.
Other men from Berdych's surroundings have to be responsible for another process, and other cases have not yet arrived before the court.
To date, the main negotiations were taken by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who were in Irish detention and waited for the final decision on their delivery for the purpose of enforcement in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - invoice: 12 million
The lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, wants to require 12 million crowns of compensation from the hospital in Třebíč.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore does not agree with the proposal Velebas at all.
"We reject such a proposal that it is too high at multiple times," said Dostál after today's negotiations.
"In order to give us an opinion on this counter proposal, we need the opinion that the opposite has made.
We'll find out if it's actually worth statement.
However, we believe that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of areas for all," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should move between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for each month she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion that the University Hospital in Prague Motol had worked for him.
The children’s parents believe that experts in psychology and psychiatry suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men took the stress situation better, even though they saw themselves accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
In turn, the women are more likely to cope with the implications of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is now happening, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola defeated Nurses of the Remuneration Hospital in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
The district head of the Vysočina (Bohemian Moravian Height) passed 100 000 crowns to each family at the end of October as a substitute for expenses caused by the error of the hospital in Třebíč, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law because of liability.
In the event of doubt, they must take part in a reserve fund, but only in exceptional circumstances they can request assistance from the carrier.
The courts have so far allocated comparatively low amounts of damage to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came around his Kingdom of Walachie
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the brand "Kingdom Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he first used the name "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in long-term work.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiations today.
According to his attorney, the matter is probably not finished with it and his client is probably going to appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka parasitically," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
All of them presented themselves in the words "Walachian Kingdom" just this actor and comicer.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have a nearly ten years of work behind us.
Money acquisition and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is dispute for money.
"After years they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasitically at our work," he continued.
Professional business
According to the Court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
At that time, however, this did not coincide with the intent to establish a fictional kingdom.
Some years later, Harabiš came to the idea of spending wailing passports.
A business and entrepreneurial activity were crystallized from a originally pleasing action, with Harabiš joining the establishment of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997 Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered its owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also stated that Harabiš used only the idea that Polívka had published in the "Manege" mission for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Welsh Kingdom," said the judge.
But she added that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team were intensely dedicated to him.
The cooperation of the parties who were disguised today lasted until the year 2000, when Harabiš organized the official crowning for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, between Polívka and Harabiš began to raise the disputes that were culminated in the deposition "König Boleslavs I. elected until the St. Noble Day".
The leadership role then claimed Harabiš's Jarmila Šuláková as queen mother.
In 2002 Polívka then submitted against Harabiš and his company the complaint that the court refused today.
Clearness in the dispute could bring the Harabiš prepared competition for the throne and a half princess.
A new king should come out of it.
Details and a date he didn't want to betray.
"We don't want to hurry.
It was supposed to be something like the king's traverse in the Walachie.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also log in quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Decreasing advantages
To say the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not much worth, the quality of the gear switch, the steering and also the processing could be described as less than average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The combi with the name SW is still a piece further, and I only stay to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classical hatchback of the 207, I had to complain, for example, about the too low headlessness on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer present, because the combi body is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Fast Continue
I'm just going through the interior so I can't repeat too much.
It is a very successful design where I have objections only because of the mere middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more designer design where the car would otherwise make such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may complain about too short seats or head supports.
The side content has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
With regard to the room offer, you can also feel the increased dimensions of the body.
In the Combi, the lack of headlessness already mentioned is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
But the main thing on this car is the charging room.
I must call it (also due to the foldable back window) very well behaveable and space-saving.
The hollows are equipped with hold bars that represent an ideal compromise.
They are not disturbing, distracting, and even holding more heavy objects.
But we talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains clearly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a foreign holiday or when a child car is invited.
But in order to highlight the positivea, I still have to mention the fully flat charging room or the very low charging edge after the folding of the back seats.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a circular capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that's how a 1600-cubic motor should look that drives a family hatchback.
He's quiet, has a low consumption and is moving well away.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes works as if his puff was obstructed with a lap, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not just national.
But we need to remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious inside and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 gasoline engine of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite much already.
The premium features of the test car again beat with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had headair bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disk wiper solution, electric window lifts back and...
Thus, the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but once you count the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So only remains the decision which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools is not successful
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, causing the native fears of further development of local schools.
The integration of the East Europeans has so far resulted in a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original residents are increasing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, treachery and raveny among pupils have devoted themselves to parental relations.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended themselves with the boy insulting her with racist mocks.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after a attack of two minor girls.
The girls had reportedly made racist comments to the man and cast him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bush and spucked on us.
When I told him to stop him, he threw us with apples and pears and then blew his pocket," a mother of Slovak pupil in The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the conflict with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle to survive.
The above cases testify that the mood between local and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly tenacious.
In the UK, 70000 Slovakia have been reported here in search of work.
Accordingly, some 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, that will be fulfilled if you only select the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with cellars that offer on the beach Pizza, ice and delicate cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to a great extent.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for America's conquest.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havanna once became a camp or passing camp of treasures that robbed the Spanish in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
Hotel Nacional was created at the end of the 20th century.
Building it one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered crime (especially during the ban), was liked and supported on Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high houses grew over the wide boulevards cars, which were one of the cult symbols of the fifty years of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his hunting.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your car diagram.
At the bar at Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails for you.
And the cult cars of the fifty ride around in Havana until today, because the once imported sjigulis and fiats in the salty and humid air have long collapsed.
Mag Havanna, especially his oldest part, have been strongly descended, nowhere in the surroundings you will find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just exhausted, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have not only been created in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar pipe from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-driven narrow tracks to the sugar plants.
Their fleet park has not been renewed over decades, so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose fellow ages have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion targets
The most important places do not leave the majority of visitors to Cuba.
You don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana anymore.
Only to mention that there is a museum in Hemingways mentioned above, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime floor.
The mogotas, calk hills and rocks, rising steeply from the valley floor, gathered fruitful soil in their hollows, which also covers thundered rock areas with dense clouds.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form you can meet him if you visit one of the Havana cigarettes.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean episode of the "Major Zeman" television series was turned there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish had colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought her to trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied in the delicious beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is a so distant place that there was no road there in the fifty years of the last century that the area had connected to the other country.
This isolation contributed to the lack of respect.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the "Tal of sugar plants".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, who live after the darkness, and where the music doesn't swear until the morning.
Maracay
This small town all over the east of Cuba describes some as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely, this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo must overcome high and crushed mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly touched by human interventions.
This eastern subposts of Cuba took UNESCO into their world heritage directory thanks to the unspoiled nature there.
There is the best chocolate manufactured, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in fact it has been created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, is seen several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the best known.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra-Maestra mountains, the pork bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, over the tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the offspring of slaves confess, about all this could be written on many sides.
But, as you say, look at better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, claim Americans.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO should, according to the Defence Minister Robert Gates, draft a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place according to its ideas, and in Edinburgh, the representatives of the countries who stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban sides, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Minister of Defense, Robert Gates, called for the NATO units to be more active, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan Government and in strengthening development aid.
"In Afghanistan a forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow the inhabitants to start even developing the economy and security," says British Des Browne Minister for Defense at BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels has, according to the U.S. Army, reached the highest level for five years.
The number of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
NATO countries have stationed about 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of which are in the southern territory.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached an absolute limit on the organization and equipment of the units.
They specifically demand additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will need to think seriously about the specific objectives for the next time and how we can achieve them," Gates said.
Today, the Secretary-General of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop, said similarly.
"I am not pleased with what we have in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we needed, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Reuters Agency at the conclusion of three-day discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been disputes among the countries involved about whether all the allies in Afghanistan are giving their best.
For example, Germany was criticized for passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British boulevard newspaper "Son" called the German soldiers Faulpelze this week.
"Afghan Non-Sure detached: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Son" in a contribution supplemented by photos of German soldiers to play the table tennis.
The German newspaper went over to the counter-attack and printed an image of a British unit in a Rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will be rising to a billion in 2009
In each Czech Republic, a state debt of 84,000 crowns is deducted.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to debt this year with 159.2 billion coins.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of the public budgetary policy.
The government debts of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they fell by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on state debts from the beginning of October.
There is a debt of 84,000 crowns on each Czech Republic.
Over the past year, the state debted by more than 111 billion crowns.
"It seems now that thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we may not exceed the limit of a billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, it sees Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance: "To exceed a billion we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If there should be evidence that the situation is changing at the political stage, and politicians should be ready to save more, this could take until 2010.
But I don't go out of such a change," he observed.
Debt growth
The government debt is dependent on the government's debts and comes primarily from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
State debt is financed by treasure statements, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic government debt has now increased to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The government's foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how well the economy is.
Interestingly, the growth is primarily due to debt securities where the growth is 20 percent.
It is bad that debt increases, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," said Pikora.
Better than expected
The 2007 financing strategy and the handling of government debts show that the government had planned to incorporate 159.2 billion crowns for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improved development of public budgetary policies.
This amount is mainly due to the government deficit, which is apparent to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It also covers maximum appropriations for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion crowns, a ten-milliard reserve to pay pensions, the financing of state debt loans for 43 billion and the loans for the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion.
In order to give a name to a teddy bear, she was presented today a court in Khartoea.
According to her attorney, the British teacher who had been accused in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison and then sentenced by a court in Khartoe on Thursday evening.
The British was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old pupils to give the name Mahomet to a teddy bear, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserves to be whipped out.
After parents of pupils had complained several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher who was working at the Unity High School of Kharma was attacked at home on Sunday and accused according to Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code of Insulting Islam.
In fact, this issue takes its beginning in September when the teacher invites her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classeddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school director Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as the preferred first names.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image signature My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not wear a sign with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as the insult of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbon, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew them well, and she would never have done anything that could be too close to a religious faith, I regret only that she has asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion it is only an innocent mistake.
An opinion that shares many students of the teacher who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks in the class about religion.
Consider that the first name Mohammed is at the same time the second common name given in the UK, for which 14 different writings exist.
This first name, often selected by Muslim families, is considered to be a kind of honor to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give him a toy, for example?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday at the last negotiation meeting in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo have ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion session without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not agree on the status , said European intermediary Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With the emphasis that peace in the region is at stake, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina urged to fulfil their commitments to the preservation of peace and to continue the discussions beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and suggested that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unite the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of 90% of Albanian speakers could become clearer if Ishinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartzchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council until 10 December.
The discussions of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiation session since the Troika had been commissioned by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans are expecting their intermediary assignment to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the authorisation of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, are continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains an advocate of a negotiated solution, a unanimous solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Independence Declaration?
After Kosovo has been administered by the UN for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision for the only solution with the future.
Pristina is willing to announce them unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide for its benefit.
Belgrade consists of stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced in the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations were held the last chance since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the cosovary rebellion and future Prime Minister of the Province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan on autonomy proposed by Belgrade belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino Effect
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tradic felt that a compromise was always anxious and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is especially a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision was taken solely in the Security Council where the Russian ally had a veto law.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they have started: in the Security Council.
The journalists replied Fatmir Sejdiu that the Parliament of Kosovo would have the last word regarding the status, and added that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking population will expire in liaison with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was held in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israeli and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further explained that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas would have agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a definitive regulation of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, explaining Bush, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for the peace that they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House emphasized that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Government under Abbas will ultimately seek a peace treaty that will clarify all open questions without exception and including the central issues .
This name covers the three serious problems to which the disputes between Israeli and Palestinians are mainly addressed: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the destiny of the Arab refugees who have been expelled from their homeland during the conflict of 1948 in the present state of Israel.
According to the U.S. president, Abbas spoke and stressed that the coming negotiations were carried out comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert spoke on the other hand, he committed himself to the direct and without interruption of the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations and to try to terminate them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the time limit for the implementation of his vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli which exist next to each other for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has received an assurance in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace, in exchange with its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a path of separation in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi Arab Prince in his interview with the Arabic-speaking newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumours are confronted.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 17 o'clock, a police car on the Rue Louise-Michel headed towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on strip, and drove with 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a speaker of the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without authorisation, not released for public road transport (see below), was driven by two young people without helmet with very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car, after it had ignored its advance from the right, a policeman continued to explain.
The alcohol control carried out in the vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (protected cocktail wing, split windscreen, demolished bar) is evidence of the intensity of the collapse.
Very fast, already yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that she entrusted to the IGPN an exploration of the "facts of involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in liaison with the main public security management of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor explained that she excluding the police's responsibility for the investigation of the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, which were heard Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small motorcycle has reached relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of riols, certainly caused by the friction of the foothorses on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained stuck together until the police managed to brake.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The body names of the two victims were obduced yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumour quickly made the round, so the police would have left the accident site very quickly, and that without providing help to the two young people.
Although IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude any serious mistakes.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations that require further investigations and which must be done very carefully.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin who was nurse in the hospital to try to live her again, tells this Witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who shook.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people who called the fourth.
In view of the tension that was rapidly about the event and, as it seems, because of the certainty that the present people had about the unintentional situation of young people, the police of colleagues who had arrived at the accident site were taken in the car.
According to this witness statement, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massages but in vain.
I'm not going to allow the claim that the police wouldn't have helped the young people.
The first aid was given to these young people.
The firefighter came right away.
Everything has been done to try to save her, stressed the prosecutor.
In Pakistan, tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police have defeated the first demonstrations since two days earlier, General Musharraf had called the state of emergency.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, approximately 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated measures taken against the emergency level were injured by the tear gas granates that used the order forces there.
Then they threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's Advocates asked for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of approximately 500 arrests of oppositionals, defenders of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were locked to prevent the congregation.
Other demonstrations had been found in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northodosts).
On Monday, the lawyer movement received the support of the religious parties united in the Mighty Alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the emergency, and to those who had put an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
Pakistan's Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election session on 6 October.
The Chairman of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was exposed and dissolved.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and opposed to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of the newspaper The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the supreme command on the army and become a civil president is no longer valid since the call for the emergency station, declared on Monday the Vice Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would issue his military uniform until November 15th, the date on which his first term of office as President ends.
The Vice-Minister for Information also confirmed that the elections of January could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government rejected the rumours that persistent in the country, according to which President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy leader.
More than one third of pregnancy is still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the badly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancy (36%) is not planned, as a study of the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the badly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of use of the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraceptive prevention has still enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned today.
For one of five couples even calculated precisely on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the room station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is essential for continuing scientific work at the station.
A daring exit, which has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of inhabitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools put up by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the spaceboat Discovery, a large cylinder-shaped part that is soon to take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module lab.
But you have to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to implement a 17,5 tons of heavy power generation module via solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew went to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose span length is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like accordion, was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one metre
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts who originally left the spaceboat Discovery for a control and then repaired another solar collector whose rotation system was defective, saw themselves forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30 meters long remotely controlled arms of the spaceboat that had been installed at the station to perform the repair.
It is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was thus selected to operate the injured sun collector.
After carefully assessing the damage, he separated the defective cable and fixed a type of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool that he used, a mini hockey hit, turned around with isolator to prevent an electric blow on the sun collectors that produce several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station designed and brushed.
When the action ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Last afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the spaceboat Discovery to anticipate the return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned at the stock exchange
After the aviation and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros in order to counteract the residues of the A400M, the EADS share currently shows a significant decline in the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% to 21,96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again referring to the residues caused by the only slowly progressive development of the A400M engine delaying the plane flight.
The cost announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft is between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced by the European manufacturer of EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting their quarterly results, he added without further detail.
The group also suggests that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month residue.
The EADS’ business performance has fallen from 86% in 2006 due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
The group originally provided a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of the status Quo
On Sunday it will not be thrilling at the counting of the urns: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's Party, United Russia.
After a very locked campaign, she confirms her striving for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters who have already been recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which announces a surprising victory.
Yesterday, the President did not let a look at anything when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was satisfied with delivering a new attack point against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have been there.
It prangs a campaign contaminated by oppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the oppression of the demonstrations on the last weekend, ex-chach world champion Garry Kasparovder had been sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer's ban on visit.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two more important questions arise:
Who will take up Putin's successor as President?
The Official Journal announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make themselves known until 23 December.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin is not able to act for a third mandate in succession.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the majority of Parliament and the Almighty United Russia, who will choose government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidency elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not Lord of their destiny, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of St. Petersburg even goes back: the bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized to Europe for five centuries; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin resumed the model of a paternalist state, which was fully adopted by the population, the more since this new paternalism followed no terror, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians from free pieces refrain from the personal responsibility they have exercised in the short term after the decay of the USSR.
Why do you think about it for a long time?
This phenomenon concerns all classes of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to keep the status of Quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local election lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equal to chaos, as in the 1990s.
Generality prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why do you think about it for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad why they dissolve?
A Heavy Thinking
After they have been treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, who document the fate of 17,5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which have been housed at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now, except with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and called, i.e. on request of a former victim or his family.
The eleven States responsible for their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the USA, agreed in May 2006 to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heavy information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the health condition of forced workers, Reto Masters, head of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, have been opposed to making these so-called documents available to the public, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
For example, like the alleged homosexuality or the spiritual disability of some deportation victims.
The prisoners of the concentration camps or the detention commands issued by the Gestapo were gathered for a practical reason after the war: civilians who had been deported or under forced labour, and possibly provided them a proof of their arrest in order to ease them the way to their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen more than 300 fixed tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There is nothing basic new in these documents to be expected, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism of the Technical University of Berlin, explained in 2006.
The EU and India want to obtain a Free Trade Agreement in 2008.
Currently, trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is the most important trading partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, indicated that the European Union and India hoped to sign a Free Trade Agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is the first trading partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A Free Trade Pact will make the two economic areas enormous progress and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans , confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most commonly exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued to explain. Asian and European giants exchange goods of EUR 47 billion and services worth EUR 10 billion each year, Daniéle Smadja, Chairman of the European Commission Delhi Decree, and regrets that the mutual trade has not yet exploited its potential. On Friday, the EU and India meet at their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, the Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about confronting the current recurring disturbance over the credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual duration.
In order to weaken the fears that the financial market conditions will be particularly hard at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organize their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank intends to provide a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase which begins on 6 December in the form of an open-market operation for five weeks .
The Bank continues to explain that this would bring 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) into circulation on 6 December, to the basic tax rate and only to 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE in an open-market operation brings liquidities in circulation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is willing to take further measures in order to receive the different interest rates of interbank loans with its basic interest rate from day to day.
The difference in interbancary interest rate from day to day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been adjusted to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18th.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of summer, the sums brought into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to penalties that the banks had prevented from claiming them.
According to certain rumors, strengthened by the development of the pound price in contrast to the euro, many prefer to sign for the sums put in circulation by the European Central Bank to more beneficial interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to verify the PS's proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist Code on purchasing power, which is similar to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was drawn up in the context of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), suggested about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, most of which were 50% employed, for the re-establishment of the TIPP flottante, for a transport check or for the restriction of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which partially gave a strong exchange of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before the television contribution of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The leader of the MP Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would propose the overall nature of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative project for the correction of finances which had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promoter/Producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work together with a person who has served, no more and no less, as an example for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones told from C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 organises the Lollapaloza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most renowned festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of the production, license concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now take up up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever attended, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work together to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We chose Philadelphia as a market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in Philadelphia City Centre, says Charlie Jones.
We were negotiating the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in political debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has brought back to life the Lollapaloza Festival in 2005 in Grand Park Chicago after it has profiled in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
The two events were able to achieve 9.8 million dollars in 2007 and 11.8 million dollars in gross taxpayers.
These two festivals take place in urban surroundings.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas the ours are rather taking place on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to somehow merge these two concepts together in order to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and a urban in the American way."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to give up the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to take up a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very great", in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations to the groups have been sent, but that nothing could be confirmed yet when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if there is no less than the Terminator.
These locking tests are part of the delegate tasks.
A political "heicle mandate", because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, advocates "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
"You must be careful because it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are beneficial, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who think the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the present precedent of the cinema is the highest priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the West Coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about to introduce the films from Quebec, to evaluate them and to ensure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the stock exchange ahead of an end-year rally? Disagreement with experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With nearly five weeks until the end of the year at the stock exchange, the investors already have their hands in terms of the next end year's rally.
Nevertheless, experts cannot create safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December is usually associated with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to create forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not when serious tensions determine current market events
Although other experts do not approve such a strong rate increase during the last weeks of the year, they note that the stock exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, which, due to the lack of secure stock funds, invest mainly in pension funds, which is severely affected by the up-grading trend towards profitable assets.
As a result, these experts believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral trend affecting market fluctuations, especially because we cannot estimate the scales of the possible reduction in the US note bank interest rate, an uncertainty due primarily to the rise in raw oil price and the risk of the increase in inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the Sales Department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market ranking.
The chances are not very good, assures the expert.
The Spanish share index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its maximum mark on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the investment funds and traditional grants made each year around this time.
Nevertheless, the expert stresses that this year things could develop something differently, especially because of the end-year rally already in the second week of December, and consequently directly after the bridge day on the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at the Bank Inversis, the previous market situation assessments are at a nearly technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values which depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis in the near future.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values that Ibex should advance to new maximum values, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney emphasizes that this year are the great values in the row.
The expert would be among the value gains the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
At the same time, Federico Olucha of the Bank Inversis assures that the increases in the banking and industrial sectors will result.
If the Rally actually occurs, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In recent months the ACP has been on recovery courses and we hope that other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, the expert says.
As regards increased consumer behaviour during Christmas days, market events will be determined in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also achieve positive turnover results, even if they are represented in the Spanish market only in a small number.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only showed in two cases zinning courses.
At the end of 2003, when technology blows, this led the stock exchange from its crisis and simultaneously initiated the last real end year rally.
This year, in which Ibex raised 35 by 28.17 percentage points, the December showed an increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in succession (i.e. Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and will also show an annual end year.
Popular will open its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institute that operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a big milestone.
But also for the rest of Spanish institutes, as Popular is the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches weekly to 20.30h and to use Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The Bank Group BBVA, who also repeatedly read the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement, with 75% of all branches closed on Saturdays and opening up for them on a weekly afternoon, if not for the customer.
Whether further banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening times will depend on the experience value of the Popular Bank.
And especially that is the intent that the popular is pursuing with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of the branches which, due to their location, can include the merchandise of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large stores.
The Bank wishes to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not new, but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will reorganize the premises of the branches already located in business zones and at the same time adapt to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of opening hours is linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more current, colourful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require any larger investments, but was associated with an increased staff setting, since a branch now needed no more than six employees, but eight or nine employees.
The branches that will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience values were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to be a wise decision.
Popular currently heads about 2500 branches.
And more 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide selection of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to present competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With phoneica they have reached the agreement provisionally to sell mobile phones using external bank staff.
The Spanish private sender Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We've done it.
With this sentence, the Managing Director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the conclusion of the stock exchange. The transmitter led him had increased its value by the twofold of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, defeated his joy: that is exactly what is hurt me; not that we have increased growth, but that we have had lower losses, he found.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not been too deeply reduced.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous this year's losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches EUR 4.488.88 million, while mediaset controls the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento is only involved at 13%.
The Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value amounts to 2.193.46 million.
The market value of other stock exchange-notified communication companies, on the other hand, increases to 3.571 million in case of Sogecable, to 2.518.53 million in Prisa (producer of Cinco Días magazine) and to 1.779 million in Vocento.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, according to Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question appears to be to what extent we can actually operate stock exchange technology, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco declared his project to increase the first television broadcaster with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the transmitter would increase its advertising income by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business could only increase 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for the better stock exchange history of Telecinco is the analysts in the high payout ratio that the company has been able to show up to this date: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría caused a 100 percent dividend payment.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endmol, with mediaset as a parent company, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares to the official compromise, even if we have been more and more increasingly.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose shares we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the final mole shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently has some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of a reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1%.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and 7,5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: sets on its high efficiency and sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: to measure Telecinco (purchase) as a result of the many incentives and the prosperous market, a more beneficial position in the case of antena 3 (hold).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends reimbursement of expectations in both cases due to similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary preparation, which today ended with the Senate Congress decision on the supplementary/administrative requests for the project, the government published the provisions arising from the new law with the intention of enabling both regulations to enter into force until the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congress and Senate Deputies, who had pursued the objective in their negotiations and votes to establish the best possible system that guarantees the security of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee generally efficient market events.
In addition to modernising financial markets, the MIFID, which re-established the Securities Service Regulation, pursues an improvement in investor protection, increasing the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV), and promoting cooperation between the different control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows specialised companies as well as natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the creation of new financial services undertakings (ESIS), consulting firms, which are associated with investment and intermediary companies of securities.
In addition, it extends the number of financial transaction systems, which would add the regulated circulation markets to the multilateral effects transaction systems and to the internationalisation of trade contracts, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges the investment companies to communicate the priorities of their business profile, confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Economic Commission of the Congress saw further changes afterwards, with the decision that, due to its high risk level, the debt securities provided must now be considered as a complex financial means for the investor, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US hypothesis crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the working areas of dictated economic scientists was adopted 30 years after the 1977 regulation, which restricted the areas of work reserved for economic scientists.
On the other hand, the Senate established new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator who works on foreign account, does not require authorization from the CNMV and its services for the commercialisation of products and for customer profit at the same time can offer multiple investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (ICP) has increased by five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price trends which took place in Spain in November.
Its publication corresponds to the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seeks to compare local and quality with US products by communicating the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be drawn up in advance by using the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to assess the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) urged that the premature indicator should only serve as a guided value and therefore not agree with the final result announced on the next 14 December.
The consumer price index (ICP) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in VPI in November was a temporary development, whilst assured that the price index would continue to remain relatively high in the coming months.
However, Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current number is not good , Spain's inflation difference with the other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less equal in recent years.
He also explained that there were less surprises in November than in the previous month, with which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of about 4% , the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs announced in terms of the forecast published today.
Virgin is calculated with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros in the next three years
Northern Rock's stocks have fallen by more than half, after the Bank was in crisis at mid-September last year, the British note bank had asked for an emergency loan, and they have now only been more than 12,000 million pounds (which corresponds to EUR 16.800 million).
At that time, the bank's assets amounted to 25,000 million pounds, a sum which has been significantly reduced within two and a half months by the customer's confidence loss and even despite the government's hundred percent guarantee that the money will continue to be safe until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the Virgin Money brand, must bring about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks, which will be composed of the plants in the next three years, in order to obtain exactly the 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their objective of 30 billion.
The group of multi-millionary Richard Branson, known by its striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to make 50,000 million pounds (approximately EUR 70 million) flow into advertising and marketing campaigns every year in order to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named the Virgin Group this week, in which three other companies are involved, as his preferred bidder to lead it from insolvency.
The Mayor of Totana arrested because of supposed suspicion of participation in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested this morning the current mayor of the village of Totano (Partido Popular) of the town of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of distortion in urban corruption, which was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo held the office of Juan Morales last May, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at that time chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could, according to the information of the broadcaster Cadena SER, be the original wire tractor of the complot.
The officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to the information provided by the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and therefore privileged Member Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client's residence on the basis of important burdensome documents to be related to the commission.
In addition, other sources of information from the supposed contract payments of morals to a Galician construction company that provided for the conclusion of a urban contract in which the construction of a large area of 200 hectares was decided.
Eight people are currently in charge of investigation.
Bono agrees to accept the candidateship of the PSOE in Toledo and, the case of a election victory, at the Congress.
The former Minister of Defense, José Bono, has adopted the offer of the Government President and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, which will therefore lead to the list of PSOE candidates at the next General Elections in Toledo and, in the event of a election victory by the Socialists, will take over the office of the Congress President.
So it announced José Blanco, the organizational secretary of the PSOE, and Bono at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero was held in the headquarters of the Party today.
The head of government believes that the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the coming elections, the politician from Mancha would appear to be the president of the Congress for the Party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who announced that he would no longer enter the next General Elections, end his career in public policy and, instead, engage in the university field of climate protection.
The former Minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the Government President had constantly urged his return to the political event.
Moreover, he pointed out that, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economics, the party did not want to refrain from the citizens, who would take over the posts of the Congress President in the event of a victory of elections, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the Chamber into a House of Respect and not to convert the offense or the cries to make them appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time one gains the impression that the only place in which one cannot speak quietly and left in Madrid is the convention; the government president was interrupted once up to 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not seem to have taken over the office since otherwise his political counterparts would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate criticizes both the skeptics of climate change as well as those who focus on a social and political debate in this regard, the movement as a whole must be strongly coherent.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement, which, like the Government President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new contract with the planet.
However, this proposal brings him in a need to explain the need for action, or non-treatment of its government, which has made a decisive contribution to the fact that Spain is headed in the EU of the countries which have at least fulfilled the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Those who are responsible for the non-compliance of the requirements on which sectors this is due, and why has his government, who had proposed the Treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures it proposes against climate change without changing.
Which companies are affected by the changes in the behaviour of the citizens, the individual and collective saving measures to be implemented and the economic consequences of them.
More specifically, who must sacrifice and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will be no such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can be realised against climate change are unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol center proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero appeared in a position to be so dangerous that he was forced to resume the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty Proverbs without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its contracts with the planet, the politician, otherwise suitable for election campaigns, must not speak, accusing, nor demand, but rather pursue the demanding issue, decorate the meetings and enthusiasm others with his gentleness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its pure virtual nature and therefore does not imply that the bicycle will become the only means of movement in the future or that we may only refresh ourselves with a fan.
The Mayor and the Head of Police of Totana due to a supposed interference in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the village of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. Furthermore, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur for the supposed suspicion of urban infringements were taken into custody, said it today from research circles.
The City Council was arrested at its residence, from where he was brought to the municipal office and in whose premises he was located until this date, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the urban administration and at the municipal construction direction of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the flagships already held in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of unlocked building grounds for urban projects should be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should build 4000 apartments on the property after the local administration has read illegal commissions to it during the last legislature period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested but were subjected to an investigation procedure which was initiated and carried out by the first Totona Court.
The first six arresters have been presented to the judge today.
According to investigation circles, it is also determined against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP member Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a property company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend residing in Murcia, are suspicious.
The Chairman and holder of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer of Vigo and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the Managing Director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company has operated as a subgroup of Nuaria and has received the lubricating money.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban delicts, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives took 11 further investigations in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests held in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farmer who was supposed to have acted as a mediumman.
The Nuaria construction group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of Murcia's village, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of area in Totana, which was to be rebuilt. The aim was to achieve a building project that would increase the population of the community to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar that promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which specializes in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term book of the month and instead try to invent a price name other name with appropriate competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are welcome to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is also at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the position published in the same newspaper on 18 November; accidentally on that day, the issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
According to the tragedy on the school of Jokela the subject of the public debate has become the content of the philosophy.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an abiturant who quoted in his news the works Platon and Nietzsches.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the Chairman of the Education Council for the philosophy, Pekka Elo, invited the teachers to take a more critical position toward Platon and suggested to remove the teaching of Platons from the sub-level teaching plans for the philosophy of Gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads into the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a law break that was punished with six months of imprisonment.
However, if you rob a music business again under a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you deprive the business of up to a value of 1000 euros, the thiefing is a penalty level, however, the penalty is lower than a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you clutch a car and give it back forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than in a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to take part in a beating than in a music data exchange.
Participation in a rebel conflict involves a prison sentence of three to 12 months after itself (Article 154 Criminal Code), while data exchange results in a freedom withdrawal of six months up to two years
(Article 270 Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization by the author has not occurred, is exposed to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographical film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should have the right, then someone has really screwed up his demands.

My house doctor transmits me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings of the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of colleagues.
The study was prepared by a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last edition of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner brain research center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and, on the other hand, failed his co-player.
The researchers could recognize that the brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were right with their answer and thus received the same level; but if one of them received the double, it also came to a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been insufficient for eight years after the criminals of the Balkan wars. Her office is located in the prosecutorship of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, resident in La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, as the main responsible of the massacre of Srebrenica - with the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died - the Ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former serbo-bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be on free foot.
Their names are listed by the director Marcel Schüpbach from Switzerland as a presentation for the title of his documentary films La List de Carla (2006, in Spain) and a film that, with the pace of a Polit-Thriller, pursues the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her project to track the escaped criminals and to put pressure on the respective governments so that they can cut their networks closer.
Which insurance is best suited for me?
The CFZ insurance covering a possible damage caused by the driver includes a high cost of the amount of which depends on different factors, including age, gender, time of making the driver's license, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Have a car is only the start.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate CFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear what we have to do with here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement shall be held in writing by means of an insurance contract which determines that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged, in return, to submit the corresponding deduction amount in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance consisting of several factors, including age, gender, time of making the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or used.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that higher contribution payments will also be due in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both over 25-year-old and women have to pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as they tend to be less inclined, according to the statistical values and accordingly, by companies.
The benefit to be measured to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When the premium is compiled, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that meets its personal needs.
We are now listening at this point to the most important points that should be considered when selecting an insurance to make a price-oriented choice not only a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The lower 25-year-olds meet on numerous obstacles when choosing a price-efficient insurance, such as the low driving practice and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete a full cash insurance, there are still more price-value alternatives.
Careful drivers can choose a full box with self-participation, so that the services of a full-casco insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount resulting from the damage itself.
The amount shall be fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher than the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera , Spain's main representative at First Europe, a intermediary for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance that ensures customers against external accident damage, but not against damages caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs, so your credit increases by trying to drive cautiously and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic tariff for the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in the rate mentioned.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on society and their earnings.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can be allowed to increase bonus payments, Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year trade mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. For this reason, the fact is that with increasing driving practice the accident rate drops.
Thus, it is most useful to choose full-cash insurance with self-participation.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of driving , the Spanish leader of the European company explains and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been dealt with.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to complete a full-cash insurance; of course only if it allows the financial situation of the respective person.
On the side of the insurers, couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, full-cash insurance with self-participation (with a amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. In case of receiving a high credit, an extended insurance should only be used for the third vehicle year.
They operate more relaxedly and have a greater purchasing power allowing them to apply a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is recommended to complete a full cash insurance with self-employed (with a amount of EUR 150), or an extended insurance which only applies to a sufficiently high credit rating.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it is high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan to the point for the eight-finals
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point they are missing in San Siro to reach their respective goals before finishing the Championsleague pre-runde. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while it decides on their participation in the Schotts.
The Italian team has already had five points and has confirmed its participation in the fifth round with an uncertainty in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow needs another one with nine points to ensure that the FC Shakhtar does not get Befica Lisbon with six points with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round of the game, as the FC Milan must take place at the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where it will be fighting for the first time on the 13th in the semi-final for entry into the final, which will take place on the 16th.
Thus this group will be completed before all others and the uncertainty at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not speculate at home want the Keltik Glasgow know that they would be in the case of a victory group stern and thus have a better starting position in the eight-finals.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even suffice a defeat at a slot of the FC Shakhtar to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not be too much reliant on such circumstances, because at nine points equality the Ukrainers are allowed to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win at the second game (2-0).
Thus, the e-mailers will try to avoid the shots in the evening. They will hope to reach the eight-final of the redesigned Championsleague for the second time after they have been defeated in the preceding season in exactly the same round by a gate of caca in the post-play time (1-0) and by a zero to zero undecided on the playback.
While the FC Shakhtar waits for the victory of Rossoneri, the team will have to concentrate on its own game, as both the achievement of the eight-elfinal as well as its membership at the UEFA depends on its victory and defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, the Benfica Lisbon could take the third place by a victory and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In the Canadian Vancouver, the Spice Girls gave the views of 20,000 viewers for their first tour after the resolution of the band in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained that the mood in the reunited band was excellent shortly before the beginning of her concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium.
Around the 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the sold-out stadium, showing a video on the history of the band that had provided for Furore in the late 1990s.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the publication of a new album, which includes its largest hits and two other songs, headlines and voodoo, and which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on stage, which they had previously given to the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his spouse Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for Shov, Victoria Beckham said that the British star did not get our wardrobe to face any time, so I'm very excited about what he's going to keep from the appearance.
Sporty Spice, whose exit from the group in 1998, due to internal disagreements, moved the resolution of the group two years later, expressed its nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed that the feelings of the spice girls had changed.
And therefore I thought why not, so I am happy to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed himself about the separation of the band that caused it nine years ago.
The singer also stated that the disputes were eliminated and that now all of them were very happy to resume.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in a special machine of the Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, according to the CTV television station.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received by an army from children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will appear next in California, in San José, on 4 December, and in Los Angeles (5th and 7th December).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23th.
New fears of natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to western Europe are affected.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) is directed by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is very accurately observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the natural gas, Russia will charge higher transit fees.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent conflict between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom attempt to reach agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be more calculated, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additionally for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversations," said the Minister of Economics of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters.
"The change in natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] on Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom shortened deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas supply, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of pre-punishment registers for workers outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought in Scotland in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish State Health Service does not have precise ideas regarding the number of foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a terrain car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in a video transmission in October and was stressed in connection with the suspected autobombing attack in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service shall carry out checks in advance of the appointment of foreign staff to ensure that they have the qualifications, experiences and authorizations necessary to work in the United Kingdom.
Although health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify pre-punishment registers, the Agency does not have the power to obtain such information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Management Board should draw up guidelines for the Criminal Registry extraction which helps employers in controls in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some staff documents, they have not been carried out routinely," the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation directives with a high degree before the appointment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information about the number of foreign health service workers is available."
BMA Schottland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations before the appointment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current pre-establishment tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is probably higher, even because the boards would have problems identifying those employees who have been allowed at an indefinite time.
The investigation continued to note that established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were predominantly observed.
These include passport, work permit and qualification controls.
the Scottish government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for controls before the start of the appointment for foreign staff in the NHS.
The secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a concern to me to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines regarding the control investigations would be reflected in advance of the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad, their publication next month.
Joy Division dominates film prize award
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has accommodated five prizes at the British Independent Film Festivals, including for the best film.

Rock music was the center of another prize winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film received the prize for the best documentary film by Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The prize for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafiabosse in David Cronenberg's London-playing thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation to play hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris prize for his outstanding contribution for the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest are currently filming the Indiana Jones continuation The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to get the pride that was named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He is my type of man, a great actor of his time, I am truly honored."
The independent film prices, known as bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia has discovered yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for their belonging to cells that had planned an approaching attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest petroleum exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle missiles.
Sympathisans of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an alliance of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man strong rapid intervention to protect plants after a misleading Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal Ministerial Declaration, says that 18 of the arrested were part of a cell led by a "raket expert" who illegally immigration into the country.
He reports that the military had planned to smugg eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the prisoners were accused of killing clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to stop Saudis who are striving for Iraq to join Al Qaida Milizen who want to fight the alliated forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is considered to be heretic by the Hardliners under the Sunni sauces.
Al Qaida Milities consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policies of the royal family dominating the government.
The Militaries - accompanied by Osama bin Laden calls, Al Qaida leader, born in Saudi Arabia, aimed at the prowestern Saudi Government - have been devoted to foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy plants.
"This was a very great effort of the security forces over the last... five months," a speaker from the Ministry of Interior informed the state television.
The arrests also covered a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed at advertising for the "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims, who support violence against Muslims who are burned as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the military.
The climate on the Venus could show an outlook on the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship located on a circulator show that the planet is even more like an alternate twin of the earth than has been conscious.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary tracks, but the Venus of the Sun is slightly closer.
billions of years ago, Venus had ruled on conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even have been inhabitable, now scientists believe.
But because of the inconsistent carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through sun radiation and a slower rotation rate, the Venus introduced a completely different development course.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has an surface temperature that is hot enough to merge lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and flash towers.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, which has examined the Plants for a year, offer a fascinating view of how the Earth could develop in the face of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physics Department at Oxford University, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of the Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enables us to construct a scenario in which the Venus started billions of years ago as the Earth, possibly with an inhabitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
A pound of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police speaker said that three people were arrested and that the material was tested.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said that it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
All still open
Mitt Romey said he didn't consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally declared ready to ask a debate on YouTube, record questions on video in the normal voter and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who asked democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican party that breaks up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with those who would show the upcoming candidates to YouTube Clips.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was devoted to one subject, immigration was at the centre.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of independent voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed tips of consent when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The tightest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who moved forward in the crucial surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shaken the reputation that he was engaged in illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of setting up illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly horrible as a questioner wondering whether one of the candidates would support an amnesty (the Illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian Congress member, and Tom Tancredo, a Congress member from Colorado, succeeded in hooking this issue.
None of the two men have serious opportunities in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have been härter than others on immigration break.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates share the same views in general: sharper limits, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic than other topics were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinking should be considered to be tortured.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now contrary to all expectations at first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When urged whether Jesus would approve them, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally open.
Huckabee's ascent in Iowa is falling together with Ron Paul's recent donor successes and his attack storms in the Wednesday debate.
These two are shot up from the nothing because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000 a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a twin to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly sloppy.
No no noble titles appear to have been sold, no politician paid Paris hotel accounts, no extramarital toes.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has drove donations to the British ruled Labour Party over more than $650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, something without that of the fighted Gordon Brown would have come out well.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister had withdrawn from the request for a election, indignantly insulting the British intelligence by claiming that opinion issues had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharply represented president of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown developed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unskilled rescue of Northern Rock, a bank attacked, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgment under fire.
Badly thought-thinking proposals to amend tax laws have imposed corporate associations against the government.
The tax authority’s loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative puzzles.
A retirement trio of generals launched an uprising in the Upper House of Protests against reductions in military expenditure: being ministers of armed forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abraham; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and her former Head of Compliance) has already resigned.
Nothing of this means that Brown will break up irrevocable direction of detachment.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point where they can not feel it is possible to rule.
Neither can people trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new troop takes over the office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister is improving the situation, and he needs not even for a long time to be present, this repulsion is over: the public service begins to become unseen; the cabinet ministers begin to plague; the press is looking for bad news; and the government will become defensive and goalless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new beast.
As he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his superleutant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax documents, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's misbehaviour - as with the long "adel's title money" investigation of political party financing - the voters may assume that he was it.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as she looks like
The errors are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely dwindled.
And the antidote, as painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally stolinistic tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new word for political donations is a good example.
The garboese of Abraham, who compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, says he would not wish public recognition for his well - being.
This may be the case, but the decision on it did not allow him.
The laws against anonymousness for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Whatt, he says he knew of Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial driver, who was told about the extraordinary donations in October.
But Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he blurred this determination by taking into account a well-known instrument, an investigation committee on the subject - to complete the measure, by a retirement bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "this teachings" are not very complicated.
When the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in the Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and progressing with a dramatic reform of political party financing.
This would require the hardliner of labour to cooperate with the conservatives and perhaps to abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party fellow like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in the opinion surveys; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through incompetent integrity and solid competence.
Card sharks
Does the credit crisis affect America's credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that back-flosses are whirling around.
Now where America's real estate market violates, the robbery animals have the credit card market of the country in the visa.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagious risk of underfunded loans spread to other forms of consumer credits.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases both in the deposits and in the absorption rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not available or are more than 30 days too late.
The HSBC announced last month that it took a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer financing, partly because of the weakness of credit carders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and insulations are still low.
According to the credit rating agency Moody, the third quarterly surgery rate of 3.89% was nearly a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration of the rates can be explained partly by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency Laws in 2005 led to a abrupt case of bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a large part of the credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus the fee for the cancellation) would rise again, whether the general conditions for creditors are worsening or not.
The industry also reports of solid payment rates which show how much consumers pay from their debts each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the amounts of expenditure for 2007 will eventually be 25% higher than last year.
There are surely direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers incur credit card debts, now that home loans dry out.
However, card exhibitors look forward to the flow of money instead of to capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
They can even be advantageous for the card exhibitors.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates decrease when real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts under the reimbursement priorities become more important.
Card exhibitors can also respond much faster and more flexible than creditors to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid revaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and totally review the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main financial representative.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of sustainable deterioration are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and a reduction of American credit in recession penetrate, the industry will undoubtedly face a worse future.
Keep looking for these sharks.
British bankers confess themselves guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be brought before court for their role in the fraudulent system with the former head of finance of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their requests in guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally charged innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was initiated on January.
But during a hearing before the U.S. distributor Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty for a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in Britain during two years of delivery procedures.
In the United States, its case is a loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The original accusations against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the aim of an investigation of the government in connection with the Enron Decree.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they had come to Houston in 2000 to cover a fraudulent complot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron's partnership, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent enron agencies that contributed to breaking the company into the bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Headers control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for 1 million dollars.
The bankers paid caps $250,000 for a participation in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely stood against Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for their shares in the subsidiary.
But the 20 million dollars actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, heads and others sent about $12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow was guilty of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons Pleite in two charges.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a six-year prisoner in Louisiana's federal prison.
Header sits a three-year penalty and a month in an establishment in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a 1 million dollar deposit that required that they live in the United States in expectation of the court proceedings.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, broke down in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of bookkeeping tricks could no longer make billions of debt crushed or weakening businesses profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former president Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling takes a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were invalid after he died last year for heart disease.
Not quite bottom in Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulf stream stand last Friday at the Millionary Exhibition, a four-day orgie of the showed consumption organized in a nested exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest new Russians in everything, from Mahagoni-bedded yachts to diamond-coated autogrills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a shiny orangene porsche at the next stand of the fair into the visual.
"That's a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money like Dallas at its glorious times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians act as the most visible free-to-learn money publishers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold noise.
Otherly in Moscow, this week a conference of the luxury Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell high price goods in markets like Russia.
(The Conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars, totalling $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires are the second class worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written here by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert committee.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived under the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jewelier.
She had visited the trade fair for the first time with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary, and the men are all worth a wealth."
While traveling through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothing, two real estate brokers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 call themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing she wore, like a red Teppich veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed primarily aimed at the new empires, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyer who would be willing to stand in the stew for several hours to visit a sudden warehouse, which, unfortunately, put Cadillac Escalades, pocket meter from Platin, Mövenpick ice cream, tailored billiard table, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddybears together.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patrioticly at a stand of exhibition by the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before a wall-size imitate of a Rembrandt image made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-shine logos to the type of sober brand with limited number of pieces that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people drove through the halls, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or simply tourists.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, he had sold two 70,000 dollar mattress sets, made of silk, kaschmir and cotton, with seamed gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, said that a company equipped high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the cruel orange porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer wishes, said he had sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which resembles linked chain bracelets for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tyre that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with spikes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a rouletterad.
Costs: $22,000 for a four replacement.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants to have voltage leather wheels or an image of his wife's face from cubic circonium, will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-way garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russich Millionaires" would not express much exclusiveity at the moment, given the increase in the real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaires, at least on the paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There's more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as if they were rich in a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells according to British model, which were full of mountains of false million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passengers stopped to throw around the money hops, mobile photos, as they lean back in the middle of the spare richness, cut off by friends, or simply put some millions in.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Explosive surgery suspected in New Jersey
It was the day before the festival of the harvest when Ronald Livingston saw here through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and watched as an ambulance at the white Cape Cod kept two doors below the West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the box car of the medical body watcher arrive," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The hearings learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant of the director of the Newarker Police Decree.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized, cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify, and who worked in the house at the West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found what caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxocological investigations whose results could not be available for weeks will help to clarify a mysterious death that sent a sadness through the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant of the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard working and persistent," said Mr. McCarthy about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarker police officer who worked for the alcohol control comission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for Union County’s prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have notified little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday no one opened the door to Mrs. Castros house, where a sweated rose shrub stands in the close front garden and a Dalmatiner bells behind the house.
A blue barrel described with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in the parking area next to a door that led to the bottom floor.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark for the first time, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, "You have to pay attention to this or that," he said.
"She was here always when I arrived here and she was here always when I went.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the Central Bank will reduce interest rates will lead to an increase in world share markets
The shares sprang yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the Central Bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest reductions were strengthened by reassuring comments by the US Central Bank Vice-President.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the second of Ben Bernanke, the president of the Central Bank, said that policy had to react "flexibly and pragmatic" to the persistent pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down detrimental markets, given the signs of rising loans tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulence had "partly some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October reversed".
If the increased turbulence remained, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is willing to enter and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The statements also helped calm Wall Street, given further bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US property reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were stressed by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its worldwide employees, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for serious losses from their lost wages in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will disappear in London, where the Bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289.40, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-establishment of credit pressure to the markets had been underlined after a strong demand for auction of three-month guarantees from the European Central Bank granted to the European Trade Banks was given to a considerable 4,7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to follow the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to inject further capital resources into the money markets in London increased when credit tensions were seen to rise the three-month "Libor" rates for loan between UK banks by 6.59 percent to their maximum since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England confronted with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to be the number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral president, is here at least under this special title to help the chief trainer Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filled with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for which in part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth battering position will be unhappy, but life is often unjust and sport is undoubtedly unjust.
It is never easy to nail exactly what enables a person to reach the top of his professional branches, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary that are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good conclusions that know the business well, should be transported.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a major influence on decisions, but they have opportunities.
Within a team, a kricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a batter has to get regular opportunities if he wants to make an impression as a single-day kricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than James Anderson, who seemed to be playing in the first test, even when Stephen Harmison explains himself healthy and how the wind bolts into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at the Asgiriya stage, only one question of view can be.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it may make little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still struggling to consolidate himself, which created the breakthrough to a significant test crucket player and who, although he scored a double dog against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and abdomens for Shahs after a further discussion on Bopara's youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah speaks his funky and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, with 22 years of age seven, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his homemena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the selectors as Vaughan, was healthy to withdraw his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his blow, which was still obvious in Bombay.
On the other hand, the All-Kennant of Essex has shovelly joy in life.
He was impressed by nothing on a cricket square and his attitude was taken apart from it when he had recently skipped a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick out his vodafone (naturally also sponsored) and call his teammates Alastair Cook, who had watched this from the distance, and to say with enthusiasm, "Did you see that?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he boils his middle pace with some effect here on the field, which seems to fit to him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe this is the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah may not stand well if, as the tea rate from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus charges of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad, with a current of displaced persons whose money or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels they had expelled from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operated with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transportation.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a sunny doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw in the television and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad, and how sure it would be now."
They say that the Mahdi Army has ceased to kill people," he said, in relation to the Shiite Militaries of the Militant Clerk Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered to put back his forces at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominant Sunnite part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime Iraqi was not allowed to work.
His Shitian neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local military supported by the US has contributed to expel Al-Qaida from their bastion in the west of the capital, and forced him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with handgranates after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started the Anti-Al Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been attracted by the increasing tranquility in the capital since the US troop increase and the growth of local "groups affected" citizens who armed and defend their districts in cooperation with the American military.
But more talked about having been forced home by visa problems and sewage money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi people have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister who had requested Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian squads of death in the country.
"We went well until Al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged Iraqi to no longer give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
A part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnites were displaced from Shitian residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have dropped.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will regain sectarian tensions and conflicts will arise.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is leading in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education the Saar countries express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I've explained to a non-Saar country yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French" - this slogan puts the smallest country self-ironically on his 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is located on five place in the Education Monitor of the Institute of the German Economy of Cologne (IW).
In this way, the universities already cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can complete their study here with a double or even threefold degree.
Accordingly, the share of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
However, the national children also bring Saarland in an excessive number to universities - many of them without a graduation at the gymnasium.
"In Saarland you use the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IM.
More than one fifth adolescent acquires his qualification at a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also largely expanded.
Measured by the population number, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of graduates of engineering has decreased by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering scientific subjects.
"We have started some reforms after the first pisa study," says a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced national comparative tests.
In order to start learning the children earlier, the last Kita year is free - a model that is now also copying other federal countries.
Whether the performance of the students is sustainable, future comparative studies will be shown.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as strongly as other federal states.
Bavaria's expecting better.
And to the disturbance of the Saar countries, foreign language knowledge is not measured at Pisa - in this area one could otherwise do.
Because the language of neighbors is obliged to Gymnasia - even though the Saar countries are not French.
Chávez converts the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks tend to be different from the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will turn back the timemeters in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a witchfigure.
According to Venezuela’s Official Journal, a new law sets the clocks to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This means that the South American state receives a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez founded his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world would have imposed the division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the discontinuation of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia due to a hostage.
The left nationalist said that as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remains, he would not have relations with the Head of State or with the Colombian Government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who pursues a constitutional reform on which the people of the oil country must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was the decision of Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe, with his decision "spucked in his face," criticized Chávez on Sunday.
Chávez is also in all the mouths in Spain.
A new phone rington in the country provides for Furore: "Por qué no te callas" (Why you don't hold your mouth) is the sentence that has already been downloading more than half a million people from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who, on the recent Ibero America summit, had been educated by the constant interrogates of the left populist and had driven over his mouth.
Germans threatened 2007 wage minus
Despite the strong economic trend, German workers are threatening real wage loss this year.
Experts called a bundle of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could actually expect less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"Indeed to this is the modest wage development, VAT increase and price increase in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomy and Economic Research of the "Image" newspaper.
New taxes could also be paid to workers in unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent of the change in the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, if the Federal Labour Agency should not be embarrassed to ask for loans or grants during the covenant, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it became known that the price explosion in foods and mineral oil products has been the highest inflation rate for 13 years.
Prices rose by 3.0 percent annually.
Venus is the entire twin of the earth
The Venus, despite its vibrant atmosphere of the earth, is more similar than previously thought: The European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and windwirbels to the Poland, as they also occur on earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists suspect it's flashing on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has proved – it felt electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The flashes on the Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen-Theory", flashes have created life on earth: thunderstorms should have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of the Venus, there is little living: the atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's will of the earth, but it's a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has taken up such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the nineties, no probe had been on the way to explore this planet.
The latest research results, which are now presented in several "nature" articles, believes that the researchers not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the commonties of our neighbouring planet with the earth are greater than initially accepted," the Esa notes.
In addition to the already known spinning wind of the North Pole, the researchers also found a wolkenstrudel on the South Pole, which turns much faster.
The phenomenon reminiscent of air flows on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a research team on Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres.
The planet also referred to as morning stars or evening stars crawl around the sun in just 225 days.
But he turns much slower around himself: A Venus day lasts 243 days of earth.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 ° C and a pressure of 92 bar hardly remembers the earth, scientists assume that both planets have developed under similar conditions.
On both of them, waters gathered, which remained on earth in oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonate stones, it makes it the majority of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Köhler defends Merkels meeting with the Dalai Lama
President Köhler demands an end of the party dispute to receive the Dalai Lama at the Office of Chancellor.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned with Germany's reputation and has asked the great coalition to end the dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world in this question," Köhler said to the trade sheet.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even though I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took note in protection from the accusation that it operates a new China policy.
"The German Chancellor did not distance the traditional one-China policy.
China also knows that," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly discouraged the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from a number of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier complained the Union's 'shape window policy' in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas at the Chancellor's Office, severe errors occurred in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only invited German Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of Both Countries according to information from the SPIEGEL.
China's head of government, Wen Jiabao, has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge the reception of the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China refuses when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The deeds and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he attempted to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Scheuble warns against cranes as in France
Road battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against cruels as in France.
It must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany should not be detached into violence on the road, the Federal Minister of the Interior asked.
Barrikaden burned, Randalierer shot to the police with scrap flints: After the heavy youth cruels in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to ensure that we do not also build up social fuel and escape into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hannover.
Not every young person faces the rapid change in social reality.
Bund, countries and municipalities have already worked hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference, this already shows first successes."
For warning, however, it is too early.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In northern Paris suburbs, young people had delivered heavy street battles with the police during the last nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
However, the president of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Colat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In view of the cruel in France, Colat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as brisk as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Colat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people under 25 years of migration is "excessly high".
It is essential to provide for more training places.
Colat stressed: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, in Germany more than in France "a social control takes place in the families".
Many youths with migration background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Colat urged: "But we still need to be careful."
You have to "give the young people the opportunity to participate in work and training".
In the meantime, it remained largely quiet in the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of the police were in operation, a helicopter flew over the area with shiny wardrivers.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trashs and cars.
Since the preceding day, an offer of about 1000 security forces ensures rest.
The police will intervene as long as it was necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburb.
The night on Tuesday at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 policemen were injured.
In the follow-up, the disruptions took over toulouse.
The cramps were inflammed by a traffic accident in which two young people died on Sunday.
After first findings by the prosecutor, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the kingdom of Angela Cloud
The trueness-proof appearance of the Chancellor documents that the coalition is at the end of its content - and that there is nothing to be expected of herself.
In which country does this German Chancellor actually live?
After their desolate appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wormsome and contentless, one must say: not here - not in the country that must finally be ruled by it.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation that they were too concentrated on foreign policy with an extremely superb sentence.
It was provincial, she said and showed that she did not want to understand what the critics were about.
In the Bundestag, it has documented for everyone how much its accusation applies.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a sense of feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: a abolished politician who fleees into foreign policy and remains in danger even there.
Example of climate protection: As it is loud for the decisions of Heiligendamm, it does not say how to achieve the climate targets in this country.
Overall, the self-globe - so much immodesty the CDU chef had failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the flosses that the upheaval comes to people.
So she damages her image as a pragmatician who solves problems instead of talking to the world beautifully.
But in the empire of Angela Cloud, internal political problems are an outline.
Children's poverty and the worries of low-served people?
She's got a couple of sidesets left for it.
It is notable how often it promises when it comes to child surcharge.
Three approaches need Merkel there to bring out half a straight sentence.
It stumbles like on a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney provide a hard exchange - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already deprived of the first topic.
He has made New York a "refuge place for illegal immigrants", with Mitt Romney provoking his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
On the other hand, this contradicts with heavy accusations: "I would say that his own house was a port for Illegale," says Giuliani and suggests the former governor of Massachusetts to have private immigrants employed without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: Because the Republican base continues to have no clear favorites, the eight presidential lawyers use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-rotated 30-second videos that Internet users have submitted via YouTube are hardly more than taggers.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," suggests John McCain to his counterpart Ron Paul, who, as the only one in the round, demands an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also receives the Levites strongly read from the Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", an interrogation method that simulates drunks as torture.
However, that the main topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates show the reactions of the Saalpublik in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are refused, the Auditorium will notice.
It shows again where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
"I've been mistaken at that time," Romney explains crushed and puts before the base and television publication for appointing him to be one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Guiliani, on the other hand, comes into the slinger when, in his opinion, he is asked for the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil
One day after his resignation as Army Ephesus, the Pakistani powerman Musharraf has been defended as President.
This ends eight years of military domination in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was honoured for another five-year term of office on Thursday.
The Pakistanian television transmitted the ceremony at the President's Palace of Islamabad capital.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office as a armiesheft to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bore himself to international pressure especially from the USA.
Eight years after his power gained in an unblooded military pussy, the former general now rules for the first time as civilian head.
With his resignation as the chief commander of the forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core requirement of opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is an end to the exceptional state that Musharraf had imposed on 3 November.
Shortly after his abolition, Musharraf will, according to General Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, remove the exceptional state and thus meet another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Land, which Musharraf had occupied with him weighted at the beginning of November, rejected all claims against the controversial re-establishment of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribe region of northern Belarus in an attack on a military convoy and four more injured.
According to an army speaker, the bomb exploded on a road near the border to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the herbal rock return
Germany's Supergroup of the Seventies is again musical: The three band members of Harmonia once again took up their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
To the revival appears an average of their great time "Live 1974".
Already then they were much more famous abroad.
The enclosed sensation then occurs in the form of three set men on the evening table.
Everyone has its box in front of himself, its cables and primarily its buttons.
Dieter Moebius thront in the flower white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone contributes noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to interfere with the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band harmonia has played again has provided for some excitement among hero-rock lovers.
What one can reveal here: Targeted demands showed that the name was shaking through the collective pop memory, but not so persistent to miss this band for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German also celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially in England and America, what is called misleading herbrock, it was always more important than in its own country.
When the music industry gave the survivors of the Cologne Group Can the Echo Prize for Lifework in 2003, the hall was seen in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers still thanked the Laudatio bands La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the wonder did not know any limits.
On concerts, Michael Rother later knocked at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the V declaration in the foreigner is this one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmony because the trio existed only two years and at that time also developed a much lower power than they were subsequently assigned by others.
Moebius and Ruilius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the cellar under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label held by the church.
Rother had taken a short time with power plants and then played a call as a guitarist at Neu!, the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as a city-flying municipality.
Less ideologically than in the municipality I, where Rodelius was still allowed to plague as a girl.
Ever in a sharp artist's existence.
In the locking waste, a wrif of the singing club Harmonia Ottenstein and for the art also found a name.
Some things held harmony of it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because so quiet and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The rice collection was not for self-finding alone.
The now published CD "Live 1974" was cut with a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-head record scene, as someone believes to think of himself.
From Rother then came the desire to force harmonia and exercise occasionally.
For Rodelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band explained its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "flaming hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than it was ever harmonia.
The Griessem live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
The record company Grönland has set its goal to maintain the herbrock as an hourly German contribution to live music.
New! was already excavated like Ruilius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures of the World.
Publicly subsidized, in the context of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, old punk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
With which the entire bandwidth of the influences of the herbal rock would be circulated to the next pop music.
Harmonia fills the space of the supergroup.
The phrase of Brian Eno sweves with the most distinct sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with harmony in the farmhouse.
Legend formation serves projections of other black and white photos of our wired equipment.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drum to unlock the instruments via self-basteled effect apparatus.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technically deepened drillers.
This also does not change the choir of the house.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, sound clouds are heated and surely sang and in a beautiful place with emphase "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never Rock.
The roots were searched less in blues than in music universities (Can), technologies (powerwork) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever calls here "'68!" does not have quite wrong, and harmonia can't be put out of it even now.
Even the most natural is thoroughly covered on stage.
Where does music start and when does she stop?
This can rob you of the nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Moordic Peace", two films are again dealing with the Balkan war.
But both don't convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and baller or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide themselves in the mountains of the Balkans, there, in the dark backland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many nice-important roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism were exposing one’s desire to watch.
Now, Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - If the hunter is going to be hunted" (Why do film titles have to be as long as locomotive tariff contracts today?) perhaps.
He presents a wonderfully quigging representation: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been of loss if the fate and the film industry would not be so gracious: a man who has long behind his best times, but he himself has preserved considerable rests of the former charmes as a ruin-like monument of his descendance.
But despite this trunk, "The Hunting Party" continues along with the German production "Moordic Peace", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war movies.
With "Murderic Peace" you can make a short process: the film refers to two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbin from cosovarian hook protectors, and one of them is also in love with them.
Although it is welcome that the serbs are not once represented as the sole root of all evils, the TV-flagging film loses too quickly in baller and action.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be investigated exemplaryly, why there has actually never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who are opening up to detect the Serbian upper war criminal "the fox" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and another screenwriter (besides in Personalunion Richard Shepard).
Because the story is like a freaking thing: both small teams go into the forest to do something that the military cannot do, and both times it will be a journey into the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not just the one that comes down with heart when he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must, above, give him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the stream, if the reporters have managed what Nato, CIA and all the head-count hunters in the world have not done in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to just vengeance.
This is so bad that one would like to call the International Court in The Hague for crimes against cinema.
The film has a deep human concern.
He wants to suppose that Karadzic and Mladic are still free to run around, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they are supposed to agree only once) not all too intensely to pursue the persecution of secret political agreements.
But the good common and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes into mind.
In it it says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I feel the swollen stirnaders, meaning: how hard it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads that meant how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq films were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Nearly always, when a star drives around the world's crisis flocks or mine fields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "On the other hand of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamants" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are too close in time.
After all, it had to pass decades before Hollywood was able to play a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's list".
Some films will probably be mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" that are now classical have not been celebrated as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know today where every mass murder comes home on two screens in real time, even too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the script writers of the uncertainty it needs to tell good stories.
"Being or nothing" or "The Great Diktator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcastically distanzed artist's view of the Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan war, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Great cities will always be terrible dangerous, people will always be murdered in a cruel way, and war will always rule in Yugoslavia."
Criticism harvested by Beust for Olympia Absage
The abolition of the mayor of Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has caused severe criticism in politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the water games.
But by Beust, realism encourages the assessment of opportunities.
On Wednesday the head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called a resignation "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently developed as large motivation forces in the city as the Olympiaide.
"Without this goal, the sports policy vibration could not be kept to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to burst the project but to find a new long-term approach to "the result of a changed time beam".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with previous statements that the Hamburg Olympics were unrealistic at least by 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides about a Olympic Application, but the German Olympic Sports League," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He pointed to the decision of the Sportsbund on an application for the 2018 Winter Games, which was expected for the beginning of December.
"This preference means for us that we will have no realistic chances in the period we have so far in mind until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream is not dreamed for all time, said by Beust.
The Hamburg Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg is no longer interested in applying for Olympic Games over the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build a chance by burying the plans at that time," said HSB President Günter PLOSS on Wednesday.
A refusal of application is also contrary to the Senate Chief's statement on the occasion of a reception to the general assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
There by Beust the application of Hamburg for the Universe 2015 "not a replacement" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD citizenship fraction suggested the senate not to have used valuable time for the housing building in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because he has put on the map Olympia and exterminated the housing," said SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Little Grasbrook had always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later living use, the CDU had put one side on the "Event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had been a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed at Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Whoever connects the terms of Sweden and wooden boxes thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently, in Sweden, fabrated wooden boxes throw dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the four and ninety Brillo boxes of the "Type of Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper "Expresses" doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to an intriguing result: The six "Brillo Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén made to the Moderna Museet 1995 as a gift, are copies - and probably also most of the hundred other brillo boxes of the "Type Stockholm" which are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is nestled, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboards of the soap powder "Brillo".
A exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - produced hundreds of brilliant boxes from Pappe: these were (for cost reasons) not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
It was not artworks, but their models, just exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol in 1968 probably granted permission to produce a few brilliant wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes that have rightly entered the art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes called "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have achieved more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol had left him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at Moderna Museet, has also examined three of Swedish private possessions in addition to the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press plates were first grounded and grinded, afterwards white oil was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, indicates that the color with a painter roll was applied directly to the press plate, not oil, but acrylic colour.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," said the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not conclude another conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in his collection as copies/exhibition material."
As of July, the authentication board announced to follow the "slow accusations" raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then, one has been hulding himself in indignant silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
On the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had deployed in a hotel in Manila and asked for the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not account for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, reporters in the hotel.

They entered the peninsula hotel and called for the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops blocked the district around the excellent hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"The people have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite unit of Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption claims for months.
Manila's financial district was the main place of the attempted mutery of around 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after nearly 24 hours of refusal to join the army.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
