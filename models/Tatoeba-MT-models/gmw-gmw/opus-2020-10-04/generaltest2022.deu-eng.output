The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the most...
I'm #PRS_ORG# great and so it's not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so that it can be taken by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I really think that is very annoying.
Should I cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another possibility of credit?
I also think that children should not be told to take a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in measure.
Let's just watch, help a little bit, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can be enough child, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it's okay for him, it's good.
It's best for you to determine if that's fit for your kids.
It's not the case that he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany it for hours while sleeping.
It is probably legally questionable.
So maybe the psychologist's statement is also coming.
Because if something actually happens like a fire, breakdown, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to enter is of course your discretion;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a Crimea / Thriller a few years ago, and although I can remember almost the whole action, the title partout doesn't want to come to me again maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, a animal career commits suicide by shaking himself with food and going to his robbery cats.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a brief examination of his therapists, operates a hospital where he treats fear of patients.
The Commissioner has a little cousin who also has a fear of fire and lands with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is ordered anonymously before each suicide to go to the place of the self-mord and document and put the photos on the internet.
In any event, it appears that this therapist operates a type of underground therapy group where the patient is planted a chip that is suppressed a fear center in the brain and ultimately puts the patients their fear in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another drives with intention to die)
This fear is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a large showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is so the gross action I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author / author.
If this act is known to someone or someone could even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh ever, I don't have the password for the Wlan.
I need to contact my husband.
But that can take.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to transfer the price difference ?
Child, 4 j., splitter under the thumb nail
Child, four years, has over the entire length of wood fragments under the thumb nail (outside).
I tried to pull him with a pinset.
Very hard to grab.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child responds hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow's going to the doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote upgrading vaccination
New Omikron cases always create politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, therefore, all qualified adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to advance even faster in the corona amplification vaccinations in view of rapid rising Omikron numbers than has been endeavored so far.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a Booster dose until the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support so that vaccination campaigns will also be accelerated in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One faces an emergency in view of the Omikron variant, so the vaccination protection must be intensified urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection could be increased by a third dose.
"Let's angry you now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in the UK, with the total number rising to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent.
is the full amount refunded from the purchase price when collected?
I'm for everyone to imagine with pronomists
I sent out a application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I gaggled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can anyone help me?
** I am a foreigner and I don't want to step over the feet of any officials.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine with pronomans.
There are five books on it.
4 of them.
Only that one I bought today is not going
Obviously, the chair had an unevident lack of sales.
How can such a polster damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First on the #PRS_ORG# try.
But it's been working since about.
14 days no longer.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to add 2 chairs to the order and take this into account.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I'll write some detail about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) come more often in contact with the victims (and offenders) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A theme that really naked to me and, unfortunately, is that many victims don't let themselves help or think we couldn't help them.
I am very clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are less things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and listening, I can't reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of losing the children from this.
What I always want to make clear to all is partly very close to tears, all of them are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it's never going to be easy.
Please, always remember, you're worth living without violence, that's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series do about "League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking appearance: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why do we look forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg near the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was dependent.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giant lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said at the Hakr Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October, with a look back on the pokal layer: "We still have some anger in the abdomen."
But after the game, it did not lie down - but again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) low position in the basketball bandesliga.
More than the naked result has disappointed the way of the appearance.
Deputy is a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The Triple Quote was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all of John Patrick) with 31 trials - more questions?
The answer was John Patrick: "We were just not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife and did not implement what we trained."
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
His opposite about Sebastian Gleim reacted: "To win a fun game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the fortunate Coach.
"It felt like 10 000 people ago."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe-Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best player I've ever trained," Gleim still praised.
While in Patrick's team themselves the performance carriers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debakel and reached up to eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon came to twelve points.
Fortunately, a lot of time to hate remains not.
On Wednesday, 19 o'clock, the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg, a maximum of 750 viewers.
We had a different address before, but I changed it.
Yeah, I've reported myself a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have therefore written them again.
We originally reported ourselves a half a year ago.
Steady as from the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He can enthusiasticize his audience with new interpretations of beakers from the twentieth and thirties.
At present, he is on the way with the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" - if he may occur.
Actually, Max Raabe would have celebrated his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there's nothing to do with it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "to authority order" to inhibit the corona virus.
Other of his performances planned during the Advent period must also happen, as it says on the website of the singer, which becomes 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to pick up their dates already relocated in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia Lünen, Max Raabe has already sung a lot as a youth.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palace of Orchestra together with Kommilitonen.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of Schlagers and Chansons in the style of Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many times with prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of the charts, just like his success album "For women this is no problem" (2013).
He made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly recommended and envisaged on labels, Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music landscape is no longer to think away.
With the program "Good Day, Good luck" he has been on Tour. dpa since 2020

Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: no new apartment is created by insolvency
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the dissatisfaction of large housing companies, as demanded in a people's decision in Berlin.
"With an inadequacy, no new apartment is created, it only changes the owner's structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent remains payable in the next few years.
A colourful mix from, for example, private owners, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the SPD, Green and Left Party coalition wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the people's decision.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not exclude conversations with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further hardships in the rental right.
The coalition contract provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tensions and the extension of the lease level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 dead by tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, many tornados have been pulled through the USA.
Only in Kentucky could more than 100 dead be complained.
The pictures from there remember a war zone.
In the night on Saturday in the United States several tornados caused severe devastation and possibly claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320 kilometer long snail of devastation, especially in the Kentucky State.
The governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was drained, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is at all possible.
He only counts in the Kentucky state with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she's sold out Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is it still produced?
Or has she been taken out of the range?
Is there the possibility of ordering this vitrine in another country?
Until when do you report?
If the delivery can't take place in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, only can I order the blanket now and deliver to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned a Artike via the contact form or gave up a return and wanted to ask if it was arrived or processed, since I had not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccines and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for an vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are thus in line with the social partners ÖGB and Economic Chamber, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising blogs to vaccine calls - according to German example - is also intended to increase the readiness to corona vaccinations.
He's changed to a company he's been blaspheming about.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year ago.
He obviously did not get stuck in his old place and sought something else.
You can.
And that he didn't like you at that time: well, no matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.
I'm finishing a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the greeting!
I just lead the adventure for a group of 4 friends Over the grippe pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big arch is made, the evil weights and their motivations written, the individual acts designed, and now I am in writing the adventure of entry and stumbling already at the first encounter about my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a fleet with cereals of Gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran Sea.
The further action is to be developed there.
Some miles away from the village, the hero is supposed to pick up a group of Goblins and lure them into a backdrop.
I want to give the player's character the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with arches and seals
If not noticed, the Goblins are watching the hero in a hollow path and fly to three left and on the right of me armed the flocking work, while two with spears stop the flocking work.
If it comes to battle and subject to the heroes, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found and healed by the son of the village school, a half-elephant.
Of course, the car is gone.
2. Should a defeat be indefinite, this half-elf shall intervene with two of his servants, and come to the hero in the battle for help.
The car's still there, it's great.
How appropriate do you keep Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much to enter the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play a decisive role later, so not only cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I'll guarantee many of your ideas and I'll have more confidence in my narratives now.
I've built the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would like to send her back.
If you can then get the backshots, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am generated by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased increasingly, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all today, the transfer was canceled in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed beginning and the start accident of the schedule was far behind the planning, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 has to take priority and therefore have to restrict everything else, so Sky DE has probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, since Sky UK transferred the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Schwarzyes has well accompanied the difficult situation about the severe accident.
Then, in the F1, there was repeated regular ignorance with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that one could change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that stepping may change the tyres when there were corresponding radio demands on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for stepping.
I think you should know these basic rules simply when you comment on the F1 with a pay TV channel.
It is also not the first raad of puzzles, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both have just constant uncertainties on rules.
Generally liked with the artificial comment style of roos, but admit that the taste is.
But I'm even seriously liked to have a better Heiko water from RTL.
There are constant narrities that make both simply unprofessional, such as the ordering of coffee by the (also inconceivable) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
It is precisely the latter that brings a lot of unrest into the comment that he apparently does not take it seriously.
Not least, the advertisement simply takes place at Sky, in the run-out round Sky is the only sender to the advertisement, as you can listen to F1TV as only the German tone track without comment has to come out immediately after the race.
Nor ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels in the training also make less advertising than Sky, and that as free TV channel.
Although you have to praise Glock and tree gardener for their work, that alone does not leave me overlooking the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very drought and full of repetitions.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking transmitter that transmits the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes a better job up to the advertisement at the four races that they are still allowed to transfer.
In any case, the great F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable sender.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendelleuchte, brass and multicoloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it was sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check an email and send and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already had a defect after relatively short time (the substance has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent to provide an aquarium with oxygen in addition.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifts.
This series is offered in 3 variants of us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire installations with it.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more exits are suitable for connecting more outflowers.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, but also offer itself to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (to find with us in the shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasured rest, shell or similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-sensitive design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an auströmer o.ä. by means of an air sludge 4/6 mm and it can start.
The fan pump should be equal, or higher than the water level and be attached outside.
If the fan pump sits deeper than the water level, you should put a reverse valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent if once water would run backwards, running the water out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is applied outside, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time of 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are picked up every day here.
If everything's going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is convinced just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the field of expedition... naturally here doesn't stop corona.
Please do not evaluate badly just because the delivery is delayed, which is only due to the package services.
Of course, one likes to shame about these services, even if we say at the moment... they've got it fucking hard
This is also very different regionally.
Do not be evil, stay healthy and we all hope that there are also better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrests?
Can you order your legs in light here?
Amazon-Gruder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to the world hall
The daughter of the first U.S. American in All, a TV moderator and four other passengers have made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" missile system of the Blue Origin company of Amazon-Gründer Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the 10-minute flight took place in the west of Texas.
Under radiant blue sky, Bezos took the freshly cured astronauts to receive the most personally after their return.
"Will come back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon brothers.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa Astronaut to all flew Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV-Moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company who paid four passengers for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not communicate.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard in his efforts and do everything himself.
She was just flying, said the 74-year-old with a laughter.
Michael Strahan was also excited.
He would like to return to all again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flys to 100 kilometers height
The "New Shepard" missile system flows largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with weightlessness before the reusable object braked from large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres above the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third all-maned trip from Blue Origin: at the first time in July, Amazon-gründer Bezos was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutch.
At the second time in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who was world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics propose Bezos and Blue Origin to promote the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests to the welfare of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who has worked in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not disturb me (have already been the anorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, before studying, I also thought about professional prospects at the time that I certainly want to study and become until the promotion.
At present, however, I have doubts, especially as oppressing me the job prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you can hear great professional opportunities and the job is totally sought, on the other hand you hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs again and again.
That's why I'd really be interested in:
1) As what are you currently working?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/benefit?
3) What have you studied/What training did you do?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really uncertain at the moment, and I think I may cancel the study in 2022 and make a training as a specialist informaticist.
If you have experiences that also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why it's just a push.
Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
As it seems, there are the holidays as well as bridge days.
It was like this: last week, Mary was skyrising, which is called "ascending" at us in Switzerland.
On Friday the most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what was going on last week?
Overall stress.
Hard e-mails, which were absolutely needed to get out of the elevator, order here, all *unconditional* before the long weekend.
'Cause... 'cause?
Because "Next Week then" sounds like so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people want to afford all seriousness in a short week as much as in a normal?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also powerfully absorbed.
What's this self-aid about holidays?
What do we have to do with holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so self-employed.
My question is: Are we just like that, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical kind?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) looks forward to Christmas in their Thuringian home - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful, even if there shouldn't be snow in Erfurt, then you just go to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the festival by baking and basteling with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But until the meaningful days, she has to do a few things: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to leave now at last."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth running of the mouse and the rebuilding of feathers.
NEKTON bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NECTON bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy feather.
The majority of feather damages occurring in the birds are due exclusively to dietary failures.
Since the feather consists of protein-resistant substance, the bird’s specially rich and balanced protein nutrition is required for the formation of a perfect feather.
For a working metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occur during the mouse are based on lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON bio.
NECTON bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via the drinking water or via the soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, still not functioning
DDR-Handwerksmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locot was in use in Schlesien and Mitteldeutschland, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the reconstruction proposal of the model iron trainer ME Heft 11/1968, used with game tracks and defects see photos, function good, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electrocomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been constructed for the traction of heavy coal glance trains in the Silesian network, perhaps also from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are working on
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG in 1924 to present proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to transport 2,200 tons of coal trains and 530 tons of passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager-Antrieb AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All of them survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946 the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as a repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnenverbesserungswerk Dessau, the rehabilitation of all six locomotives was identified.
In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03, with the rest of the machines being used as spare parts donors, were developed as an increasing demand for locomotives for the heavy freight train service.
At first, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 were preferred in larger numbers.
Only when the E 94 saw that the number of workups could not be further increased, the E 95 came into the viewpoint of the reconstruction.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway plant.
They came to Halle P.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Hall, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematicly, at an increasing age, the complicated control of locomotives proved to be.
So it was more often that shelters remained adherent to switch operations.
Then the beetle on this locomotive had to re-solve the shelter during the journey with hammer and wooden keel.
The damage to the motors occurred more often and led to months of failure at the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new construction locomotives and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at the time, the E 95 could refrain from the realm of old locomotives and most of the splittergats, so that the E 95 were out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn only wanted to occupy electric locomotives once again, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the difficulties with the machines and visibility of the driver's stand.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were posted in mid-1969, they followed the E 95 01, which stopped the service on October 5, 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
All locomotives were demolished until the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a heating system at Hall Main Station.
It took a while to convince those responsible at the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was preserved as museum locomotives.
In 1979, the initial outer construction of the locomotive began to present them to a vehicle view in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Transport Museum of Dresden as an inappropriate museum locomotive.
In 1986 the internal completion of the locomotive was carried out.
In the DB Museum Hall (Saale), the locomotive museum is cared for.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational upgrading of locomotive.
In April 2015 the locomotive could be presented for the first time for an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and external paint, with the transformers being checked and five drivers are capable of operating.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Schlesische Bergbahn und die abstractions, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machinery in Leipzig became the medium-sized German network.
The main area of use was at first Schlesien
Handworks model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical reworks at the locot necessary in self-work, dusted, with game tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition- the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may contain labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet...wear these are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The central bar is held by two feet, which are unfortunately defectively produced.
The central bar does not fit in the intended holder.
So I'm going to get new.
When are they sent out?
no planes.
These are, according to the assembly instruction the right of the form, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Their main purpose is to be met
They're not flat with me
Could I get these sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
Residential fire with two light-injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential house in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage has been caused in the six-digit euro area, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the neighbouring residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech).
According to two residents, on Sunday with light smoking poisoning were brought to the hospital.
The exact cause of fire was not known at first, but the police did not deliberately fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it's coming a lot later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To unforce Fake news - Biontech-CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
Biontech Chief Uğur Şahin had not spoken publicly to his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing its corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him to, told Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how to get vaccination against the corona virus.
There was false information in the social media that I was not supposed to be vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a contribution in the network "LinkedIn".
"Since a few months, friends have urged me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counteract these false smells."
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not turn around himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of me is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a respiratory for three weeks.
The school friend and his family weren't vaccinated, continues to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often furnished by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German wave clarified itself.
"I am not allowed to get the vaccine myself at the time by law," said Şahin at that time.
There is a priority in Germany in the vaccination of the carcine.
In the meantime, the priority has been raised for a long time - and the Biontech Chief has been vaccinated three times according to appropriate information.
Fire in enclosing plant: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, on Friday evening the light went out: no electricity anymore and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had shamed a revolving station.
After a fire with severe damage in a enclosing station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine victory cruise in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to come without electricity for 24 hours.
By the fire on Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities left the lights.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday there were numerous emergency aggregates in operation until the large-scale disorder could finally be completely fixed on the late evening.
Firearms and helpers and helpers at the THW supported the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The supplier thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the firearms and the THW for the unfortunate use," said the head of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days, since the West Network engineers could initially re-use some lines only provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company specifications.
Power flows again
The fire broke out on Friday at 19.15 p.m., according to Westnet’s information in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid Umspannstation, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt-shaped system.
There is a need for cleaning and repair work.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 full-spanning level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday, 18 o'clock, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually connected from 21.30 p.m. onwards.
Since 23.15 a.m., the last of the outfall had also had electricity.
More than 80 Monteures from West Network and partner companies had been employed.
Following the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens in their neighbourhood take care of older or single people and tell them to local firearms houses when needed", said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the establishment and operation of emergency aggregates, the inhabitants of Altenheimen were in focus.
In addition, according to public authorities, temporary care places in schools were set up for those people who were unable to care for themselves or who need current-dependent medical equipment or need medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euros?
It is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount the subheading on the table plate.
It is custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of that.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't put it together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me?
Otherwise, I would have to send her back, because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased with a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then we do it like that!
Do you send me the return ticket by mail?
the repair is now completed.
I had tried this before the chat.
Before buying, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost undesirable.
We do not agree with this
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic Combinator Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are sprinted at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepääe on the podest.

Returns of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have made both s and use the version 4.5...
It could be that they have heard of problems more often
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it also seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrect to report on customer service.
As far as I can recognize it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?

I have to work in the meantime too!
To get the colour order uniform and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, wash and dry with clear water.
Before bringing the brush into the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to exercise 2 to 3 stripes.
You can do this on the later not visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first strike on the component
Draw the brush evenly stitch next to strike.
Light overlapping of the color layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid wiping quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could look through later.
Metal tones and metal colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to unpleasant metal screws if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you grow them.
Originally faithful appearance reaches the models through the decals or detractions.
From high-speed marks on planes to ship names to rocks and marks on car models: The Decals give the model the last slippe.
Bring the decals in the right order as long as the components are still well reached.
A plane cockpit can be adhesive or lighter before it is built into the romp.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, pensets and tooths are time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each required Decal individually and set it straight to you.
Decals are also called water sliding images because you shortly moisturize their back with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wets.
Then you just slide the picture a small piece from the paper and put the piece to the corresponding place on the model (which you had also moisturized before).
While you hold the Decal on the model with a tool, you pull off the carrier paper side.
Attention: Always check whether the picture is sitting right before you slide it completely from the paper so that it doesn't stick, knit, or even rip it.
Suck up excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book shortly as soon as I look at something else then I don't read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place to where I read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get these by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 individual packages with me
Thank you very much.
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But do I get that back without any problems?
Children's wish treatment at cars / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were some time in child care, now when it comes to the accounting with the PKV, it suddenly crosses.
The order after:
We had requested the child's wish-raising in advance at the car and received the promise over 3 trials.
The trials were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the car.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (successless) trials, but they did not yet calculate with the PKV.
We again requested the acquisition of costs at the PKV and again received 3 further attempts.
After some further trials (we have done more trials than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the evil surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second child's wish is a new insurance case.
According to the Terms and Conditions, however, "The insurance case starts with healing treatment, it ends if the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to refund the PKV (only 3 trials) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Had the PKV had to point out in the promises that the further attempts would fall at birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (contingent by closed ovaries) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to achieve them the best again?
All right.
We're not going to order anything with them anymore.
If they add the turnover from me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they obviously lost good customer.
They can forward this to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Last night, the colleague told me that the repayment was caused and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can do anything for the commode coming to me completely disrupted
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear and clear that the repayment has been prompted and I have still not received repayment by #PRS_ORG#
They can justify their manager that they have now lost two stem customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do this anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must stop a normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as an office chair.
No matter what, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, I can't get another type of packaging.
I will be able to remove the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be acquired with additionally purchased hockers, but we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is precisely, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major movie studio or private investor.
In the network you can find rich lists of low-budget movies, such as letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's the matter with you?
And what do you think you don't like at all?
Bin a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Did you want to ask the best price for the grey Lederofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait for 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes to the waiting position... I'll give up soon again, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Halb victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to Raphael Bossong, in conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory".
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation Sustainably, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP) explained.
This swift state - Belarus does not give up very little, but the EU feels as a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Assistance with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Obviously, there is a "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decisively turn against it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It is apparently not possible if a Member State is headed to do its thing," like currently Poland, which does not even permit access to the border by the Frontex EU Border Protection Agency.
Moreover, the EU pays a further price for its policies on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy is difficult because the line "Grency protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Re-experience of cross-border
According to Poland’s border protection, migrants have again tried to reach over Belarus in the Polish area.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday during the night and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson of the Authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been thrown with stones at the incident near the place of Czeremsza.
According to the report, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically cared for by a military physician.
Overall, border protection registered 52 attempted crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border locks.
In recent months, thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU.
The EU proposes Alexander Lukaschenko as a managing officer in Minsk to have attracted them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to the border sections, Poland and Lithuania, press reports have been locked off.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"Then the EU has thrown its market power into the scale and has proved its determination to operate with hard ban days and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take account of internal policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not insisted that the security device regularly swallows thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial formula 1-finals
Max Verstappen, according to Mercedes, has committed two regular breaches during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1-final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes objected.
The silver arrows presume two regular breaches in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed infringement of Max Verstappen in Red Bull in the last safety-car phase, when it is supposed to have overwhelmed.
A second opposition was made against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes-View, the protocol was not followed in line.
The last round of Lewis Hamilton in Mercedes had overrun and had been racing to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch had overrun driving cars before him.
I'm checking it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again.
Thanks for the support

But I'm sorry just because he says he's not an antisemit.
That's as if a rider says he has nothing against foreigners.
Your I will not give it both.
But Collegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distanze, you should just leave it complete.
Yes, then you're as little serious as Collegah.
Anyone who seriously challenges evolution is simply completely lost.
For my reason, a God has brought the whole thing in progress.
But as soon as you're creating, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just confused.
And so you're a science enemy and don't take any more serious like Collegah.
To obtain an optimal vision field, the magnification should be tightened as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatically designed lens system allows you to use the magnitude up to the edge zone to practically forgive and color-defect-free.
Lupes are often marked with magnification indications.
However, these information only applies to precisely defined conditions which rarely comply with the conditions of use.
In order to optimise the use of your magnitude, we ask you to observe the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices – i.e. also in the case of valves – light reflexes occur.
By an anti-reflex bearing, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When compliance with the optimal conditions of use - magnitude close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less perceived.
Further information is available in the accompanying instruction for use (in German and English).

Coins sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curiose situation when selling a cocktail.
One time a man was supposed to have returned home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Each year, he plants well 2000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curiose situation.
That always makes a little fun for the past night, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I'll rate that accordingly!
We do not need discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between them.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spear.
And so both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be like the "Dreher", which does not sound so delicious at all.
Glass fiber problems + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fibre connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit perfectly up to a few failures.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, they also arrive.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the wifi, no longer arrives the full 500, but the further I remove in the house with the module, the less it comes (e.g. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fibre connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set that seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than DLan, but there were also similar major losses here.
Could anyone tell me why with glass fiber so much Internet speed about the power line "lost"?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely expensive to move in the house LAN cables.
I'm really desperate, so I've created an extra account here.
That is why I would be more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change the Giro account
Anyone who thought was now resting with the giroconons is deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the rate increases in the past with all tricks by their customers, the amounts for negative interest rates are also lowering.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halfed the free amount and even quarrified for the day's money.
In a first step, the border was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to EUR 50,000 in Giro and Investment Accounts and to EUR 25,000 for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a speaker on request.
And not only for new contracts but also for "new individual agreements with stock customers".
The Commerzbank had already fallen down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as ING Germany.
The DKB, which is particularly popular with the most cost-conscious customers, has reduced the amounts to two levels, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of €25,000 or less, according to numbers of the Internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at €25,000, but there is still a legal dispute with consumer centres that have even been entitled to this regulation in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin.
The banks are already discussing whether the institutions might have to make provision - in case the upper institutions also declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions should be repaid to bank customers.
The table was delivered for 8 people instead of those for 6 people.
The subordinate is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty Army
She's officially at Hollywood's head.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley trip.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected from the American magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" to the most influential woman of the year.
For them who made in 2021 with the "Friends" reunification and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" Furore, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers will take care of their appearance.
After all, Aniston says, they like a chip every day (yes, correctly read: an in-depth chip).
The fact is that the hearts of female and male fans fly to her as well as a miracle.
Maybe because she's just having a pech with luck - and still seeks the great love.
And the baby's wish removed from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she became a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Keep hoping that success and fame also make happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönnen must give up
Kimi Räikköns's departure from the Formula 1 was even less than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled out the gloves and wiped the weld from the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a light band touch, Räikkönn had to place his Alfa Romeo at the Great Prize from Abu Dhabi after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motor sports king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children were also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was the profit of the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He created 21 Grand Prix victory, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in twoerbob - Sports
The brand of the Norwegian biathlet Ole Einar Björndale with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I've ever figured it out, I'd have to go nine and a half victory per season, then I could do it until Cortina 2026," said the double olympiacist of BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in two days at the winter mountain races.
At first, on Saturday, he resisted the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and on Sunday, with 0.30 seconds, he made a larger advance.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbeerenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he joined the British Brad Hall.
==References====External links==
"We have gone greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22th victory into series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, riding for Stuttgart, came to place two before this time on rank five.
Christoph Hafer of BC Bad Feilnbach landed eight in the first race after rank.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do so," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won the third seasonal victory in the two-bob on her homeway.
After the day before, in the Monobob it was only for the fourth place, she joined the World Cup on Sunday at the German triple success with the assault Deborah Levi.
Two-bob-Olympiasic Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came to rank two with Germany's fastest Sprinterin, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked the first podest place in this winter next to her Olympia-Qualification.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed on three place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podest place in the world cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama's taking me.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but today's start times were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not only pushing it, but there's also trumherum a lot to do."
Jamanka was a little angry about the unfamiliar rides, but said, "It goes in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I couldn't solve it because I finally asked.
Through Corona last year, I had quite different problems and never time for it.
And now he said it was expired what was very angry with me.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I would like to give it back and then order again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No until I get a tip on it an extra field with the message
It was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered ceremony.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undesirable
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello loves great girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write, and maybe the one - or others, too...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog emama - once apart from my dog doesn't scream or go into the kindergarten he actually is 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has brought up a burning 2nd degree on Monday and has been depressive for years (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel, we have kissed a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because hand is in the association burning).
It's cooled upstairs and we're currently seeing less (1-2x week) that makes me very happy with my needs for affection and love.
My dog's kid just got a stomach wow, I've cooked for him and now he's in his casket and has relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and suffocated for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and it's just gone for a month.
Now we are still holding homework on us, which we naturally divide.
But cooking yourself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just very well disposed, I'm half-way well therapyd and get ready.
Not good, but I'm fine and almost symptom-free.
My university just demands very much (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have done nothing and overmorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have a oral test on Tuesday, and what's going on is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no place left.
So my week goes like this, only until the morning, then it's weekend.
But after that the whole thing is going on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points, because otherwise I'm gonna pack it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't...
Are you like that?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't get that in words at all.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think that also has some to do with Mental Load of Women, and that's why I thought I'm sure I'd find some suffering fellow women here...
I would like you to have a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I have got my order today unfortunately is the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
During the first delivery, the color was just as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to switch the table, I'll get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two more times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
Once something completely different: I found at the time at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is only another subject for them like mathematics or academy.
For me, this was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and I always believed something like that.
How are you?
Perhaps you can also tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But just find it strange to have a physicist who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
If you don’t believe it, what will bring you to want to teach religion?
Culture real or something?
You hope question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Write English I also understand well
It's been a long time, then I'd miss it.
It's okay, thank you.
I'm expecting a feedback at the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie Search Help Please
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (about 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
For one thing, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in any case in the real world there's a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (Uniform similar to those of the Caribbean soldiers from the curse).
For some reason the paths are crossing and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who the woman wants to bring into this empire to be able to live myself.
The transition is, I think, also the tomb of the soldier.
At the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that says something to you, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one slept only on the abdomen from week 1.
Fast forward: still lives :D
Relax.
Such a child stops much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything's right, no cocklets, go inside and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and we had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it get something from the stomach?
Or is it in front of the face Directly in the mattress?
You can determine whether everything's all right.
We've all grown up, and when my husband came to birth, it was like a gang and it was good to put the kids on the stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "Stammkunde" with you and have already bought very many items
But why do you offer me only EUR 20?
Hello, I've already written with a colleague from you yesterday, and I haven't reported any feedback yet.
It is about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I'll ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently to be used.
To make it clear.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just so that the policy of this transmitter is now under all sauce.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a large bedlet tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet channel.
Quote Arno: One wants to be "no running litfish pillar".
What are you doing now?
A 0815 advertiser who tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we got Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, those apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult the people.
A Krogman who is completely lacking of empathy and at the expense of the action with the explosive rented rooms tries to make ash.
How do you think it's all right?
It's great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I'm asking for Rueck's call, because my supplied wooden table was made defective.

Whether as a comforter at abdominal wool or just to kiss – My little warmth friend is widely used.
Kirschkern pillows are a traditional home for warming applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and dosate again.
The removable inner pillow can be warmed easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel secure even if they are not so good.
The Kirschkern cushion related to the heat is suitable only for the following applications:
Before warming the pillow check on untypical smell, stock or fire spots and immediately dispose of them.
Please take the inner cushion out of the reference before warming!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (notify the microwave manufacturer's specifications!)
Directly after heating, divide the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inside cushion in the reference.
The first heating can result in a light moisture formation on the surface, but disappears in repeated applications.
Observe the warming instructions given, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (deflammation and burning risk!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the warmed inside cushion has been placed back in the reference, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your armbar!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or fever-resistant diseases, circulation complaints, fresh haematomas, blood losses and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour diseases and pregnancy, please contact a doctor before administration.
If seams are opened and loose cores are released, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible for children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be regularly controlled during use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents in connection with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The reference is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this again about five months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply is enough to operate on my own.
Missing indicator, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged power supply.
Then I've expanded the battery, but there's nothing going on here.
Vllt have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can I not use the laptop in the network?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack of Peak Design, no problem!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without problems that can be safely disposed with the polished FlexFold participants.
And what else you need on everyday objects remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The skilled, minimalistic design has, in words, developed some highly innovative solutions with the Everyday Backpack series, which protect the interior of the backpack reliably and still provide customer-facing access to the photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventional via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
There is a closure hook of metal with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak design has been looking for different "fills": there are 4 anchor bars, stablely destroyed, in which the locking hooks can be trapped.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper.
Cover closure and hooks are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be reliably closed without scratching the hooks.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other photo-rucksacks: In addition to the lid, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the greatest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to wind through the content anymore!
At the same time, this smart detail enormously increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or baggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the interior (more below) and thus separately dispose of both problems - and access it independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main case, while the everyday things remain safe in the left backpack and do not come in between.
Convenient, uncomplicated wear belts help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I was unfortunately waiting for the email of their support.
#NAME# has me yesterday an e-mail from confirmation for the order of the
Announced contacting from the expedition to pick up the table that was not delivered.
I haven't received a message until now.
I'm asking for immediate reconciliation.
I already write with the third support staff, in no one I came beyond the promise that I get a mail as a confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
It's time to get the closet back?
Keeping him so is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Wish you another beautiful evening
hallo, my order is #NUMBER#. When is the article delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
A completely different lamp was delivered to me than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher to me, I will give up a larger order right away, but after all, I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and have not sent back.
And that last year I couldn't know and couldn't solve and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotinger braking discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who knows the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically processed (bore and cut).
All coloured discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are owned for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production programme is created which is based on the original assembly properties of the disc.
The tightened discs made in this way ensure high comfort and brake effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brakes.
Aesthetic properties of our coloured discs underline the character of each car by attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event marked the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered lightning breaks in the water at the southern gift of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from close and far and made Coloma one of the country's fastest growing and thriving cities.
Areas were cut off, tents were mounted, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share in the riches of the country.
For many it said, "Coloma or Bust" (colomy or bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks riches in the West and wants to make a name.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together, and build companies.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding river runs and neighbouring areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to exceed your pioneer colleagues, not to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to victory.
You select your actions simultaneously, have to budget with your resources and build a tableau that is more and more for you "work" (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules for your benefit.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained official government).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will choose a secret location and at the same time a location on the schedule where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is uncovered and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates the one half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternating actions, such as gaining resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses and positioning revolves.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the winner turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This continues until the pricer has moved five times, so every location has once hidden and ends the year.
There is a shooting in which players must defend Coloma before an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough rebel heroes and are countlessly superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or ends on the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player with most victory points wins!

"Why children aren't tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is happy to be a guest in Talkshows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become tyrants" (2008), he triggered a severe debate on education.
Former patient: women and educators now raise serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to bear.
And I'm very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
We parents and others who are responsible never, never, never! for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to raise the frame for the child as it is useful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise the removal of the test duty for three-fold vaccines
At its next meeting, the Ministers for Health of the Countries want to decide on a federal removal of the test obligation for three-fold vaccines.
"We countries need quick clarity, whether and from when the test duty can be taken for three times", said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministerial Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The removal of 2G plus for three-fold vaccines is "not only medically useful, but also provides an additional Impfanreiz", said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministerial Conference on the next Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back.
How am I doing that best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer handle my #PRS_ORG# shopping.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer goes.
I updated account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sense perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approx. 1 to 1000.
The most common thing is to listen to noise/stems, more rare to see images and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant to this topic: Emperor cuts are operations that result in an increased rate of Awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia for the protection of the child until the degradation.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during anaesthetic discussion.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment of me describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
Have read their comment incorrectly.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ does not help us.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
This is also standard in the field of e-commerce in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check them again if at least they take back the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
We'll lose some money.
I've already sent you a mail that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
In order and invoice, the goods are delivered up to a room of my choice.
The speditor is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only delivered before the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order, since I don't know a person who can wear me the heavy furniture on the first floor.
Isn't I called?
I had put forward a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old died
He profiled himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental theater story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is the new book on the table, printed fresh: "An old man gets older."
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell from the world that led by the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the message comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I've been witnessing my life thanks here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Europeletts, standard wooden pallets, which are used mainly in the European area as charge carriers.
They are certified by the European Palettes Association EPAL
According to Statistics Austria in Austria, more than ten million pieces of pallets were produced in 2020.
The production value was EUR 79 million.
How many pallets are imported into Austria annually is not collected
New York takes MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in the regular game time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided to shoot the final with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had been fighting Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Raw Tips & Tricks
I had gotten a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect gulasch.
That was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butterfly!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I have come to taste and want to cook to the New Year's Rouladen for the first time.
Tomorrow, I'll put on a bovine fountain for it.
Or do you have some tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a big pot.
How's it going?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but that's what I get to
IIt's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today, the money hasn't come in with me.
Please check there.
Where there are Christmas breads in the Lübeck room
For many people, Gans or ducks are among the Christmas days such as the tan tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Now the time will be short.
We'll tell you where you got a Christmas bread in the Lübeck room.
The "drive" of a tube end level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circulation.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can adjust the desired level and on the other hand the decay content of your sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller to reduce the sound level without changing anything at the "gain" and the distortion.
More above, it was already known that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even make a power reserve fleet if it goes unheardly loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphone book can also be used as line output.
The signal in this area is processed with a boxing simulation, so that you can get a eminent "acustic" impression even when using a headphone or direct recording.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX book, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
If you donate a VFS5 footkey, you can also easily call the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "take" the pace of the compatible effects.
This is essential for the live use.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step in the future!
But that's what others saw.
Is there any possibility to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you continue to help me?
What about the commodes?
Do we receive another update for the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, they've already been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it's not possible, I would be satisfied with a leave or a voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only more than 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are a lot then.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the planned hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded
Is there a premium customer status at you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on revival of the international nuclear agreement, progress has been made according to Iranian information.
"Both sides are about to agree on the topics that should be on the agenda," said Iran's head-in-law Ali Bagheri on Sunday the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first, there has not even been agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, Vienna's discussions on the revival of the agreement continued after nearly one week interruption.
In the negotiations, subjects of Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia participate.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now with highest corona incidence
Thüringen has dissolved Saxony and currently has the highest incidence throughout the country.
As the only state, the value is above the 1000 brand.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was located at the Corona incidence on Sunday over the brand of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100.000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which last had always been the highest federal incidence, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but was also above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with Sars-CoV-2-virus and 16 other deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
200 severe covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays can occur on weekends.
In addition, health offices have been overloaded for weeks and hardly come back with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is only made at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick to the package and put it on the mail, that's it, isn't it?
here I don't have to click/end/fill anything?
That is exactly what I want to avoid. That's why I'm writing you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro Return fee is a freaky in my view.
It's time for changes
###MBund's day is welcomed to me, I am U/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the last months of the MBund's day, you can find one thing: it is not extinct.
We came into a winter star and expanded the summer hole to a few months.
#Where's the problem?
Yeah, what was it?
Most of this should simply be related to dissatisfaction, how some things have expired here and how we are in general.
In the last days, the impression has increased that many here really have bock on the MBund's day.
#What we need to change
At this point, the Community is asked around the MBund's day which it wants to keep alive.
The incidence came from e/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last days and has, simply, found a sheer cap.
After writing down and writing, several people from the Community have found themselves who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only so this project can exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange ourselves, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBund's day work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be modified/adjusted / removed?
* How are we supposed to occur outside in the future?
* How should new members be promoted?
* How do we create a fair choice system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's not bad, we've got the discord at the end.
If you have a desire and time, come on the discord, work with and let us decide democraticly about the future.
I ordered a lamp screen with you that's still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/coloured for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different hanging with you for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are there those also in oversize, i.e. in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a while.
And I'm asking you to make that happen now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will unassembly the cabinet as far as possible for collection - they must clarify with #PRS_ORG# as that can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by telephone to agree with a pick-up date.
Is there a instruction for assembly?
How long do I have time to get them or decide to send them back?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I liked.
She himself has lived vegetarian for a while, probably eating meat at the moment too rarely.
I myself was also vegetarian a few years earlier.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned interim step, I have answered honestly without much to think.
And that I thought for a long time that I would support the animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point reflected and understood that I finally supported animal torture.
That's why to become my decision vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression that her side was mistreated, she then defended vegetarianism and meant to know where her flesh came from and to reduce as a vegetarian animal grief.
Now I wonder if my answer to 'plump' was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put into a corner and come up conflicts without making it up on it.
It greets a harmonious-loving vegan (;
It is not a clear exception in accordance with § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not exclude from the statutory specifications on the remote.
I am on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my return on site.
Since I can't be on site because of a funeral, that cannot be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date.
From the 01.02.#NUMBER#, I'm all over again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr für Wasserrettung ausgerüstet: 45,000 Euros Subsidy from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Pälzische Innenminister Roger Lewentz at the Lahnsteiner Rathaus gave a 45,000 Euro grant decision for the new device car Water recovery of the volunteer fire station Lahnstein to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rheinland-Pfalz supports us in this regard," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The device car is used by the diverstaffel Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice saving as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected to continue with increasing use: The tree of the hotelship on Rhine and Mosel as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could read only 10% and then the problems began.
I can't open the book.
However, I followed their recommendations synced, removed and the app reloaded NOTS has worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and now hopes for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

For the first time thank you for putting the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the public service in a similar activity, we say we were also armsmen in the executive, I don't want to go on it!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the state minister is more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in the special uniform and arms carriers, people to the right of conservative magic should also be clear that these people are of course difficult to deal with the living reality, because you have, of course, besides the average white, now many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and so that I don't mean the exaggerated feminine clay sculptures now, because they are in the executive rather less to nothing but very normal men and women to whom you don't notice it if they don't tell it) and also on these people can and I have to leave, because in doubt they save your life or put it for you.
But even these marginal groups, even if it sounds funny for my experience in terms of a conservative attitude, say they are proud of Germany and feel more detrimental due to excessive left policy, even if this policy is supposed to use for them or if it means to make them right, they simply want to be treated very normally.
Back to the right, since of course police and troops are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there that they can openly say their opinions there or even openly forges any state-rising plans is medial completely exaggerated and also annoys me.
Of course, policemen and soldiers who were often abroad have often started to pause because of negative experiences, and even things that are controversial to politically incorrect say.
It is also likely that right mindmates will meet with a regenerous exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, such a thing is well fought and also counteracted with political education and information!
Germany is so much internationally twisted and that is also good in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have right racists and Nazis in our series at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
but it has been confirmed to me so in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wood are two deep candles filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
Hello, I (w32)'ve been doing one thing for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little leisure), but for my life, I get it more bad than right to keep my budget clean and proper.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I'm rooming up and cleaning up.
But it's never that 'a person could come to a spontaneous visit'.
My husband is not better, even though it disturbs me somewhere but usually loses households simply against work and unlust.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you been able to get more neat with child?
We haven't done anything yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been addressing me for a long time.
Because for me I don't have a stimulus, it just doesn't disturb me as long as no visit comes and e.g. there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger stimulus with child or do you stay sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality and anatomically pre-formed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus enables almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further shaping on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knees)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the Flex System 2 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex system in order to further increase the comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (acles, arm and knee bends)
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and in a step ensure a narrow, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panels in the Lenenwirbel area increase flexibility around the back zipper and thus improve the comfort, especially when bucking and mounting and mounting the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone which is around the shoulders and on the back guarantees increased flexibility in movements of arms and backs.
Fireskin is a warming, water-absorbing material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face at the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate headhaube)
Weak zone in the collar improves sealing with a finely adjustable fermentation by a flexible, cleaning clutch closure, which is not liable to the casting or seams
Double cuffs with zipper on arm and foot joints connect a decoyable inner jacket with a soft, cheese neoprene outside jacket
45° incorporation at completion of the internal cuff for increased elasticity and retention when dressing.
Long zipper on the neck with an elaskine amplification, for an anatomic cut with increased comfort on the whole without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (all without hood) with metal-slider and built-in Water Dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Racing closures of arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of rice closures to prevent rice when excessively forced.
Neopren panels aligned with external and internal overlap
Edges of the external manufactured for greater loadability
Edges of the interior cuffs tightened for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially in the case of deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with an uncertain personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have now been trained for about a year.
Unfortunately, I find that this profession is not the right thing for me, because I have been thinking about re-starting and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-uncertain (or fear-preventing) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means roughly saying that I have no sense of self-value and is accordingly shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people at a real level, but it's very difficult to have loose conversations and I’ve been told more often that I'm inconvenient (when I think I've got better).
Can I become social workers?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, in addiction or family assistance.
But I don't know if the concrete working everyday life is really the way I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it takes me down every time there is something to be offended to my code ("although the simplest things re-cooked") and it is difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should now really know myself how this is going"/"I keep him away from work with my stupid questions"/"the one really thinks me is inferior" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to have mentioned it in the place.
But have you retained the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for this too.
I'm waiting for a date for pick-up
What do they mean to give back !
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) incorporated with the feed breaks the bird into the individual protein structures (amino acids) in its stomach-darm trail and rebuilds its own protein substances, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation of the nestling and feather rebuilding of the mauling bird are extremely complex processes and a particularly high demand for the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON bio should not be administered during breeding, as otherwise there may be brutable disorders.
Following this timely administration of NEKTON bio, NEKTON-S (multi-vitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral substance preparation) should be transferred to daily vitamin supply.

1 g NECTON bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft feed.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/milk food as the bird consumes daily and to switch water/feed daily.
A striped spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NECTON bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or three-fold dose of NEKTON bio may be given at the beginning until the approach to rebuilding feathers is visible.
The normal dose is then reached until the feather rebuilding is complete.
Storage: NEKTON bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please apologize, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement by a community employee in opposition to the Statute
Hello r/RechtsadviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be liked on our property.
So the application is made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the cases of fruit trees and thus the Walnuss is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the Walnuss is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the staff's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use them new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a surgery or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that only the question is whether I can pay in euros and let me deliver the blanket to Germany
Can you check that?
Eilmelding: Severe traffic accident at Selb
A serious traffic accident has recently occurred on St 2179 between Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the press alarm is currently communicating to the police (14:03 o'clock), a car has come into counter traffic when it is over.
There are injuries.
I'll understand.
Well, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Council and ideas on further professional life
For the first time, happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is just crushing everything you can think about.
Before I get out here now .. shortly: I need advice and best of people who know my situation somehow - so of you.
I'm just making the Ref as a cross-country climber.
Originally, I studied something else and worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I do not call anything more precise here).
The whole thing was too boring to me then, and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I landed at the Teaching Office and was sure that it is - even if the conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job invitations".
And it's only half a year.
During the paintings before, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the Ref, after that, I can still turn around.
But I'm absolutely finished.
I had so little time for the last month, which I'm totally out of here.
Now there are holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref, I always thought I was stressful, but my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday evening my holiday evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work wasn't good at the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress to me.
And then there are these rigid structures that nerve me in addition.
Basically it makes fun and from outside view, the Ref also runs well as to feedback and so on.
But I'm totally loud, and I wonder how much stress my body holds before he gets completely closed - if he doesn't do that right now.
I wonder if I would like to have that for the rest of the working life like this - especially if I read some contributions from you here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, because where I was appreciated, I could take a free time when I needed it, and although the work was somewhat boring, but was properly paid for it and together in a team that worked and not as a single fighter like that is now the most time the case.
But then I wonder if I haven't arrived at the same place in a year as now and have been dissatisfied.
You see, it's all kinds weary, but maybe you have as foreign advice or ideas how I get out of this situation, which I am completely finished and almost start crying at the smallest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for the first time.
Thanks for reading and apologizing the female undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has progressively developed, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" scene which perfectly reflects the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to the latest state of the technology in matters of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amps, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain, of course, the multi-stage Valvetronix tube pre-amplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these simply get better the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this clever circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances spray only so.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and reverse historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
She has, of course, been refined several times since, in order to meet newly added sound requirements, which has led again to the performance of the VOX Valvetronix series, with more dynamics and numerous and crucially improved amplifier models.
From handy VT20+ to VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists are looking for a maximum sound variety here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: They expect a fat sound, a nuancated playdynamics and string attack as well as a prompt talk.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that the final stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circulation of each VT+ amplifier with a 12AX7 tube perfectly deforms the behaviour, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Losing Magic at Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main case is also adaptable: with three individual placeier and foldable closure participants, it is perfectly suited to the need for your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflectors.
What finally fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an appended lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a stitching flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can still store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT camera from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Serie) can use the backpack for his equipment and for photo-fremd things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulcan outbreak on La Palma: probably longest of history
In the nearly three months since the start of the outbreak, the Lava streams have caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days now, the volcano outbreak on La Palma has been the longest in the well-known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the outbreak of the volcano of Tehuya in 1585 was the longest on the Atlantic Island in front of the western coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past days, but volcanoologists have not dared any forecast when he could end.
The indicators point to slowing down.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Decades in millions of height
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 housings and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a metre thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, two new landings with a size of about 50 hectares were created by cold lava.
Heavily affected was the enormous banana cultivation for the island, of which approximately half of the approximately 80 000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and who had been in the crisis before the volcano outbreak.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas stands at the door, and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the thrilling tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
The more important is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of donating, so that the gestures of donation, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-founding "social agreement of natural populations", which can deviate stiff routine and be refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christian child
Strictly, it was the Protestants, through which Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Previously, on the Nikolaus Day, gifts were transferred to some kind.
The background of this still popular morality is that the Holy Nikolaus, as Bishop of Myra, had thrown three women secretly gold into their windows in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift, the popular custom in Germany was to fill the boots with gifts, especially the children.
Protestants found themselves in this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and human beings as "saint worship".
For these reasons, they retain themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child from the Nikolaus and thus founded a new tradition line.
The focus of the gift moved on the Holy Evening.
However, since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions so closely, it is only the least angry that the use of Saint Nikolaus is still a solid part of the pre-fetch time, similar to the use of Martinssingen and Martinssingen.
Today you will find everything in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to desired luxury watches that the heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources have been demonstrating a tradition of gift since the 13th century on the day of St. Nikolaus.
With the reformation, the day of donation moved to the Holy Evening.
In all Christian countries, however, a cheerful cow sleeve pretends about the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christian child appears on the Holy Evening or the Christmas man, which is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, which has been assigned some kinds of ownership.
This includes, for example, his white bart, which has only little common with the rather strict assyrer beard of the historical figure, his slide drawn from retirement and the preferential of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the Holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at the Christmas Festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, which should have shown them the way to the child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia sometimes fables bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought fathers frost to some glory.
Here's not pensioners, but three horses who, as Troika, pull his slide.
In the Czech Republic, the native of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for the handling of the gifts.

Police shoots suspected bank robbers near the king's palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told us that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled, according to the authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
It had fallen shots and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the place of crime.
The police didn't go out of a terrorist background.
In the area around the Kensington Palace, several messages are located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative light is harmoniously inserted into each beet, garden area or steering.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored with 2 grounds.

In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from remote galaxies that illuminate indoor color.
But "Smart Stone" is quite harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light is fascinating – optionally in white or coloured light (in equal to six different color tones).
The sideless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern lighting object presents itself at day.
Its organic rounds fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone beet.
Well he also makes himself in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and finders, where he knows to claim thanks to his size.
Great preworks can be saved: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« does not require a pipeline or batteries.
Put the "lightstone" on any sun-shaped place.
Two provided ground sprays ensure a steady stop if needed.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weather-resistant.
His solar module hides »Smart Stone« discreetly in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charged when sunlight falls to the housing.
When dawning, »Smart Stone« starts to shine independently; in which color you determine this yourself: Six attractive light colors, besides daylight white, are available for choice.
After all, the battery charging level will be automatically shut down to a specified minimum or it will be light again.
As soon as the sun appears again, the charging cycle starts from the front on the next day.
That's what I've done several times. It doesn't work.

Pillen Problem
Hello, dear women's people,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, is after a year reddit actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to let this remain because I have to take enough medications that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pains, but my skin.
At my last two-year break, I had got from 0 to 100 explosion-like pupils and these everywhere.
As far as superficial, but I was very stressed and I didn't feel well.
In the two years of break, the whole has never really normalized.
Maybe anyone has any tips to avoid this once.
Perfume-free and without shit, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, I haven't taken a woman doctor so seriously and Hautarzt's date is still coming.
Many love thanks to every one who read through the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Hated pre-bupertary bad neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-floor sweaters and the acne theme.
I have also tried all possible in the course of chr. disease and have been hanged on a sugar, milk and meat-arm mixed food because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormone is just the worm in it, but if you like me everywhere you want to stop looking for what else is going wrong.
I already had all her colleague semina o. a.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concern.
I always have to work on the phone in the meantime, and there was suddenly everything gone...
What is there to test if the money would have been there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.

110-kV earth cable is rebuilt 2022
Approval for the relocation of the new high voltage cable with Tann is legal.
The Planning Decision of the Government of Niederbayern opens the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was now communicated to the Bayernwerk network operator.
The approximately seven kilometres long earth cable will connect Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt direction between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of the free pipe.

Ref: curriculum planning (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the Ref since summer, teaching makes me fun, but I'm still having big problems to plan my education in the field of artisan.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy s/w freely (what's nervt).
Now I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the subject of geofactors and with me actually stands every hour for itself.
In principle, the methods also repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest excessively much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs etc.).
When planning, I am always going from learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build it (mostly I create a workheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
This is why the worksheets are also available.
Maybe I can a naturalist how to work with the book time efficiently.
I'd really be glad.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually decided for a new at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to make the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation on Christmas business.
In most shops, only who is vaccinated or healed is allowed.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains sales breakdowns.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations corrupt the important Christmas business from the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE).
In the case of transactions with items of non-day needs, sales infringements should be complained, criticized HDE business leader Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written down the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without soil," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions, therefore, lost nearly one third of their pre-crisis revenues during the expired week.
Well it runs only in food retail and online.
The Association demanded consequences from dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, the main business leader said.
"2G does not bring us further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
Current regulations deteriorated customers and required high staff use.
He asked that the volume scheme be approved on a federal basis.
After that, every customer should only be controlled to 2G (vaccinated or healed) and would have access to all businesses with the volume received this day.
In addition, in retail trade, as in public transport, the 3G rules (vaccinated, healed or tested) should be sufficient to carry out sample checks.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, specialized in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Lastly, the frequencies were about 75 percent of the pre-corona level without 2G, and the turnover was approximately 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personal and administrative effort, the Center is attempted to find and get solutions approved.
This includes the so-called volume solution, where "for example, visitors can enter all shops in a central location in the center once and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - uninterrupted". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried to be cast with a yellow filler.
That looks funny.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it back into the package and sticked it.
How do I have to go on for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor provides exceptional possibilities for adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to set and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive.
The lamp produces a very light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flimmerless.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on the filmset or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in television studios or when the lamp is mounted at difficultly accessible places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of keys and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the range of delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply pressing one of the storage keys and finishes.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the known situation is re-established when newly activated - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is adjusted to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality comes from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also verify before the set that the batteries have sufficient performance - it is a battery tester equal with installed - for each of the two batteries a value in the two displays (the upper left battery display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlamp over the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm pulp as a connection for fixing, so you can directly access your phototative.
The inclination must be adjusted reliably by means of fasters on both sides.
It was observed that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a necklace is included in the scope of delivery.
Large is that in the range of delivery is also included a pocket.
So you can safely transport or store the light with all the accessories you might still want to buy without any problems.
Damage that I have given and she is too small :(
"Party we wanted to beat": Frankfurt celebrates torrich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction of Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series of unwinning Hessen were supposed to be on the way to the next Bundesliga pilot.
But then the SGE turned up, shot the frustration over a mature season of the soul within a good hour and conquered furios with 5:2. "It is crazy what the boys have done today," exclaimed Trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "Pauschal-Lob, to every one who was with."
At first, it looked like a new vapor for the Frankfurter who was now on the nine place still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkuseners with 2:0.
What happened then impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," says Glasner.
I am madly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Also defense player Christopher Lenz, who had been able to stand on place for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overwhelmed muscle injury, stressed the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old and with a view to the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to beat today.
But now Glasner wants to keep the focus for the coming tasks, but it also looks good for the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now you want to "continue step by step and remain modest" and to "make through" the tasks until the year's change.
Next on Wednesday, in the course of the English week, there is an outward game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky).
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you because of a mistake of mine.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent again directly to me or must I wait until the money is transferred back and give up the order again?
I am sorry to say that I will not be ordered again because it has taken a long time.
Have they ever been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damping for handball women in front of quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's handball women slide after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views from the parquet.
The DHB selection, at 16:32 (8:13) before 800 spectators in Granollers, collected a defeat and has to run against host Spain in the quarter final.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," judged Bundestrainer Henk Grüner.
Against Spain we have to act differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany concluded the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danish (10:0).
It's bad that we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game of all that we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entry into the semi-final, against the World Cup Twelve of 2019, a significant increase must be made in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German advertiser in the Duell with the three-fold Olympician Denmark was a retirement player Alina Greyeels with six gates.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack, nor in defense," confessed reputation player Xenia Smits and asked: "We have to look forward quickly now."
From front to back not at height
Unlike the previous five tournament games, the German team with the pin was not at the height.
False and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 return rate after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse things with some parades.
The first gate reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Greyeels successfully completed a rapid conflict.
However, the expected initial inflammation was not.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women, the German women could hardly sit in the scene - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
For example, at 3:10 the party had walked early in 20 minutes, especially as the backroom player Mia Zschock saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her counterplayer.
In the quarter's finals, however, it may work again.
Only in the final phase of the first half-time, the DHB selection came into play a little better and until the break at least five gates.
The quiet hope for a pickup after the change was already over after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Green Protectors sinned in all areas and made it easy to the well-founded opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to raise performance and went as a clear loser from the parquet.

Are they doing this?
The title is available, I am active as an vaccine in mobile vaccine teams, where (to date only) the bioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon largely finished, there is partly going on in vaccination centers for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not related to a personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, that is tolerating with vaccination.").
In my field of task, the information for vaccination, the indication position (person is entitled to vaccination according to coronaimphe regulation and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency supply for allergic reactions (mean never happen).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccine teams, however, we often have no, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, which can not perform vaccinations (during?), so that I carry out most vaccinations myself there.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidler"?
This dialectual word, sent by an amberger, has been sent to the BR television program "We in Bavaria".
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host me?" was unpredictable this time by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "human who's nervous".
And no one either, "thing has to go fast".
That, the people heard of the TV moderator, was totally wrong.
On what the man from Amberg told the solution and thus probably also provided amazements for many upper pillars.
"The Huidler," the spectators learned, "is a lap with which someone wipes out the furnace."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed as an expert from the Bavarian television for years, confirmed that.
With the note that this is a typical oberpalzic term, somehow derived from the rather well-known mouth-type word "Houders".
What closed a gap of education - probably also in many who have lived for a long time in the Amberg area.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always comes: opens - someting went wrong - try again later.
I started the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, rebooted, connected, synchronized and repaired with the PC.
Nothing has helped.
tyre selection at the racing wheel really so secure?
This morning I was awakened with deeds, because I wanted to train at least a little for the preparation of my bicycle tour in the next week.
Said, done and I drove my racing wheel, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what happened in every city centre (this time: Thanks to Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the route.
Zack, loud circular and my back tyre didn't want to join the rest of the route in any case.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement jacket and a replacement hose because of the weekday, I had to turn around with half a bit of a bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't so bad, but maybe it's better if I do this with the tyre change before the cycling tour.
But now I face a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days before me, I would get extremely unpleasant of this problem more often.
Now it was not really bad, since the old tyres of the pre-owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike down to 14 o'clock 120km!) and who had already described them as suboptimal because he had been rolling with them for several years.
But if I think I have to change tyres after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really poorly lamented :D
Now I came to the conversation with an older man at the highway, who wondered why I didn't have the marathon Plus tyres; they should be unplasticable.
Now, of course, it sounds very tempting.
But are these really so incapable?
I have little desire to spend 40€/ripes now, just to be disappointed.
I'm still wondering: I've got on the racing wheel right now, I think 25x622.
They are also available (apparently?) at the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you guess to other tyres in a racing wheel in general?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Laie knowing rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car swallows against tree: driver fatally injured
On the B57, the 53-year-old was poured between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car from unexplained cause against a Middle Island and then moved to the counterway, as the police told.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old car was then pushed against a tree and the man was stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old companion were severely injured in the accident and brought to nearby hospitals.

After the publication of our new High End Breitband B 100- 6 OHM, it was just a question of time until our SOLO series would also be renewed.
SOLO 15 is the new sprayer and optically reminds of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this design proposal, a suitable design foot is directly included in order to lift the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in which the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role but is to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate almost unfiltered such a large sound pressure level.
This does not mean, however, that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears significantly adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was voted with a light high-tone increase.
This is generally common in broadbands to optimize the too high frequencies with a strong increase in bonding.
The SOLO 15 convinces exactly on the listening place with very clear and fine sound.
Lightly rotated outside, the high-tone range can be reduced and the sound image can be designed warmer.
Thanks to the point-sound source, the placement of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo-rear angle is a sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure an enemyynamics that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and battery.
As with all our sets it is recommended at the beginning to think about the final optics of the speaker to plan appropriate changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to furn the case, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the furnier re-adds material.
After all plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill a 8 mm hole into the ground plate at the appropriate place to be able to perform the cable in a difficult way later.
With the help of a upper millet, the opening of the speaker in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used roughly later.
On the back, this opening should be fitted with a 45° fiber to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screwpoints of the B 100 - 6 OHM will be interrupted in the fiber, as shown in the picture 'Detail fiber'.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface ahead.
On these, the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now tied up.
The three stiffs should also be used and adhesive.
The stiffs themselves may vary if necessary in the material strength, if, for example, you want to use finished performance from the construction market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a forest driller, the application of the bass reflex tube and the connecting terminal on the back wall is facilitated.
Afterwards you use a circular grinder to round all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the foot plate can also be rounded off.
Afterwards the foot plate is clad firmly with the foot of the housing and also screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the recording and drilling (2.5-mm driller) of the screwing points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connector terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned from wooden dust (absuction / blow out), one begins with the moulding of the cable.
This is most easily achieved by the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and unshort cable is pushed piece for piece through the 8 mm drilling into the foot to the terminal opening and leaves it there approx. 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the opening of the speaker and makes it looser there too.
The frequency softness is prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the frequency softness and the corresponding connector plan can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Weich Solo 15.
If the frequency softness is built and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening within the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot adhesives on the opening and thus close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can verify the seal accordingly.
Now the defeat follows according to description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this so that the plus line (marked cable) must be triggered at the Pluspole of the loudspeaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is reduced and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
A matt of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up a order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> Finally we can announce that we will also organize the OSCAST again this year!
> For known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people by switch, so we will track the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do to avoid our best, delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Make drinks cold, plan good food and make you ready for a long but very interesting night.
