No liberating novelles for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused the request to abolish those paragrafs under a novel of the Criminal Code, on whose basis opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned.
The new regulation, which could have evacuated the way for the liberation of the ex-president in prison, rejected the MEPs in the second reading of the request for a mildening of the penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of a supposedly harmful contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet legal, in December the appeal of the convicts will be negotiated before the court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West, the trial caused the suspicion of the court's preference.
The application to remove Paragraf 365, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was supported by 147 MEPs.
226 votes would have been required to adopt it.
Libyan victory
The history of Libyan libyan libyan libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it the war is over.
Now only the winners can be defined.
As it is common to this region, in the elections of Islamists, the question is just what - the moderate or the radicals.
The National Transitional Council known itself as the customary right of the Sharī北a, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would be the land without crime, because for theft you'll hack off your hand.
Women should also quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, any abtances of faith are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society from mutually conscientious tribes will in the future be united by the Koran.
In short - in Libya will rule an order that would hardly be imagined and, above all, barely desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively seen is probably not the best and would variation barely fit the Libya mentioned.
So it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were able to help even by the unbelieving dogs.
To their excuses, it may only be the fact that NATO's air attacks were directed not by any general from America, but by God himself, whose all-power was praised after any successful hit.
The winners in Libya?
We only participated in a shot change, served the interests of Islam and our politicians entreated in the person of the dictator of a political alliance, without that would have brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefer to oppose a military occupation of Libya.
This causes the peasants to be anxious - that is, the expulsion of the cruisers.
But do the mineral oil companies get the black gold at the spot price without occupation?
It is hardly and so that the West can at last, rightly, boast its self-sufficiency in the protection of human rights.
If they do not ruin the Sharī
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe focus on investors.
On Tuesday a statistical storm depth broke through Europe.
The individual countries published their information on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the prequoral, Germany and France.
But today, the Obligation Market is breaking all records.
The investors not only keep in mind Greece, but now also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Europe zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, where Germany recorded a higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France recognized a slight decline of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the prequarters, the gross domestic product stagnated, and according to the Statistical Office, the trend in growth slowing down economic performance was confirmed.
So the results are worse than the analytical forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this third quarter compared to the previous year, but compared with the previous quarter it stagnated.
According to provisional and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the entire euro area and in the EU, between July and September, the economy experienced growth by 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to the analytical expectations.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return from their 10-year-old government bonds amounted to 28.45%.
The return of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to its critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also begin to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is lower than 4%, even though the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, votes become loud, the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football choice has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-created gateway Čech and a magnificent gate of Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of happiness, the Czech football was thus able to defend its luxurious advance from home game and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed reporting.
Little excitement in the first half and a giant portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech choice also victoryed very happy 1:0 thanks to the final weaknesses of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro, and thus dissolved its ticket for the football em.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they put the Montenegrins under pressure only in the second half of the period.
The birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who expelled two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be mixed with the European championships next year, also delighted that the local football has a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes, quite fighting football was played.
Both teams combined long-lasting and so was played mainly around the middle line.
Also in the second half of the period, the pressure of the home team remained, and the wide depreciation before the penalty was successfully resisted by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for the core program of their country.
They formed a living sign.
Some hundreds of university students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core program of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday noon before the object and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Iranian Isfahan formed a live sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
With this they wanted to announce that they are willing to protect the core program of their country, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran seemed to have not abandoned its efforts for a nuclear weapon.
Also in Israel speaks of a possible attack on Iranian core plants.
Students had prayed in the afternoon before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press from the centre of Isphahan, in the event of an attack intending to lay the Iranian nuclear programme widely lame would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's target.
The menu of a fatty child: It does not dinner and eats for the evening bread sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys proved - adipous children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important the environment is for the healthy development of a person in which he grows up and are the examples surrounding him.
On the tables of adipous children, worst goods are more than half on the table than in families where normal weighty children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had pommes to the evening bread on the preceding day under the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence".
In families with thicknesses, sports is not one of the favorites, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year by the end of the school year, and nearly 900 children from primary schools were interviewed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second anniversary of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the general health insurance and the company Unilever.
Previously, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of family movement are crucial factors responsible for the alarming number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children interviewed led, for example, to eat five times a day, in the breakfast-tweet breakfast lunch-Vesper evening bread - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage to the evening bread
Experts point out that relative minorities, such as the regular family breakfast time, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
But in the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the students' families are breakfast.
And, in most families, everyone's having breakfast for himself.
The worst thing was the finding that isn't in the tenth family at all.
Breakfast is considered a basestone of healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children, they consume much more unhealthy pommes.
And almost everyone - without regard to weight - drinks sweet limonads every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed play sports, only less than half of their parents are doing so - only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), to make up their own food plans from appetite opportunities.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in puncto diet is far from the ideal of healthy diet.
Among their favorite meals were many meal, meat dishes and, of course, sweet food.
"Alarming is especially the great popularity of sweet limonads," the final report on this survey stresses.
At lunch, i.e. the main dishes, doughware victory nearly before poultry.
The kids almost didn't like the nuts and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite ready to change their eating habits when they get correct information.
"In many cases, a significant shift of preferences towards the principles of healthy diet has been cited in the project's results, in the control group of the questionnaires who completed the clarifying lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence".
This was obvious, for example, in the sweet Limos, where many children began to give normal water priority.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed many common poultry or fish as the main dishes of the day and were willing to eat less napkins or sweet foods.
Profis claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how Stylists learn, I had a little polished that this was a bit too much material for the beginning.
I didn't know at least what's going on.
Lectures from three professionals from the industry, clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the place" runs.
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer the examination comes, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully established.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (not a single man in the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideally proportionate figure.
And, after all, these are most of us.
The one has one too short neck, the others a too young figure without proper curves and again others are molly.
It is the matter of the stylist to cheat wide shoulders visually, extend the neck or enchant the necessary curves.
We also received tips on how to attract a female type such as Jennifer Lopez - i.e. with large buses, wide hips and narrow waist - beautiful and figurbetont, without being all too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the rock or pants really don't fit, at least one piece should be cut by measure.
You will certainly not regret that because well-sitting clothes are simply unpaid.
In such a tailored rock, one feels much better than in one of the rods that always stands up and down in the waist, etc.
Young figures can in turn be able to wear clothing with folds, buildings, applications, embroidery or raffination.
With this amount of information and figure types, I'm glad that I have a whole week of time to let everything go thoroughly through my head.
And yet, I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do due to the commissioned housework.
Each of the teachers was assigned a promi for which they should think of suitable outfits - day clothing and evening robes.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "take on" Miranda Kerr, which you might know from the Victoria's secret campaign.
Inside I juble, for that is much better for me personally than to dress Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent times (now good, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the clothes from magazines or look for them on the Internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our entire personal style and our relationship with graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also creates the so-called product page in the journals (by specific specification, such as trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about that.
But that's only Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture filled with information about figure types was spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, the fashion creator Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that should be a stylist able to use this.
And skilled stylist can work with a single clothing piece in a very different way.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, i.e. like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on paragraph shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to crawl up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks quite different.
"Please play with it," he stressed.
But most of the advice was given to me: "First you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you must hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we have to pauke all these teaching sets, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see different things in fashion journals.
I'm silent about fashion viewing.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten sides (speaking ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So all of this has to be expected in the design of the outfits.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success, that confirmed us also Jan Pokorný.
You only need to look at Madonna, a not just brilliant singer from which Image and Marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities think this is often thrown out of money (the main thing is that I'm bringing something like I look out is second-tracked).
And if anyone of us gets a style, then we should expect that he or she will likely force us a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to googlen to be sure that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has taken back to or down, etc.
Jan and Mario made us heartened on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then the outfit to "combine".
During his work, he must communicate with the people he knows and he must be a woven psychologist.
Guess people without offering themselves and standing at his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to see her wardrobe and to supplement beautiful pieces, then we can't clear her all the closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can carry to it," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what such a so-called "fish bag" must include.
So such a pocket that you're knocking on the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprietaries.
In addition to such clear things, such as sheer, roller to remove hair or safety needles, it also contains utensils such as a nylon thread (that means the stylist helps to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothing is handled behind, if it is too large (stainable needles or other terminals are forbidden so that the fabric does not get broken) and natural seams.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to rely on shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is right, you can damage the sole of the shoe, keep the outside.
We were sticking and sticking...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scarf, so you don't damage them.
So you really have to do some skill.
Mario enjoyed me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was only the fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - devoting to styling at a professional level is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original careless ride is completely avoidable, dilettant error for routine journey to early layer.
Although the ambitions have been largely fulfilled, what does that benefit if nobody obviously wanted to do a little more.
Before he came to the shop tables, the new part aroused high expectations with the subtitle "The Run".
He promised to move the already anniversary "Need for Speed" again a piece into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he seemed not only to be one of many action race games.
We were also curious about how the fitted passages, where the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are used to NFS, in the final effect, much is different than you had expected.
Surely - potentially it is quite decent arcade race, but overall the game is reduced by some obsolete mistakes that are present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it's actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of an in principle incomprehensible faulness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time one is introduced into history, whose main figure Jack has some personal character problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the western coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being first in New York.
The basic idea contains a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty single races.
This means that each race is carried out on another route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
One has no moment the impression that game would always offer the same again.
Some environments still have a very nice view, although the technical level of the graphic does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing that's moving around the world.
But the ride through the desert, through the natural landscape or upstairs through deep snowy landscape, makes visually very pleasant.
From time to time, untypical elements bring a little variation into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert tower which greatly restricts the view.
In the mountains, you must be careful that you are not shed by a lawn.
In addition, the individual races are very well built behind each other.
It's just a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classic race against the stop clock), then one expects a personal duel with a single contradictor.
And that's what the police are trying to do.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is rather about some interactive animations in which Jack flees from anyone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than one would expect (concretely only three).
Finally, this is more advantageous because this element has at least no chance to become boring - it is one of the elements mentioned above that make the game more varied.
The driving model goes into the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means, from today's point of view, it does not rip out trees, but it could not be claimed that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look around elsewhere.
But an action-loaded race ride continues to be very well justified by the local driving model, even though the competition could be better found.
Until then, everything's in the best order.
Real problems come up only after some time.
Unlike the model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
Of a game of this kind, it is hardly expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no impact on any object idea as the car is acting, then obviously it is not all right.
Typical example: When tightly overtaking or pre-existing cars are "tracked" in some places the other cars are only easy, but in other, almost identical situations one comes into the slumbers and spins wild pirouettes.
Or the cars go to scratch.
Thanks to the restart system, this doesn't matter, it's all angry.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far off the route, then the game throws back to the last point of the route.
Only - in every race you have only five restarts.
If you've exhausted them, everything goes from the front.
So the restarts are more like an aid, in the case that something does not succeed, but rather don't leave it.
Sometimes, however, the restart doesn't even help, there's nothing but helping to learn the critical section from your head.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don't fit.
Otherwise, "civil" cars are always met in the same configuration, regardless of whether one comes as the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially angry in situations when you see that the contrahensor passes two cars that are playing, but until you arrive there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The counterparts have further advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you will always be overloaded at the same place by the same opponent and also here again without consideration of the time.
At the heart of the test, this is for the end of the game on the long bridge that happens in opposite direction.
The contrahensor obviously has to get one out of here to devil.
And if he's in front of one, he'll take a look at you, of course, so that you start driving your own car in Klump for a few times.
Clearly - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intent is so clear that it quickly avoids you the joy of the game.
And that's bad, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is totally quite entertaining and in some way also so much action loaded that you almost don't know where one's head is.
And in principle it doesn't matter what "guilty" is about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of races in a way that no boredom can occur, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars during the races.
You should not overlook the tank stations on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car is enough that you just have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limestones for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the Serpentins in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history goes also the task mode (requirements) - i.e. the races in the individual localities that you know from history.
There are not only medals here, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (requirements) and history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, different items must be unlocked: starting from the car, to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously connected with the Autolog online feature, which, among other things, compares its own results with those of other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of the other ununderstood snitches is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you can get by car into a subway tunnel (meinetways), where you can rush long on the rail in the dark (meinetway).
On the tacho there are numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (meinetway), but at once there comes a subway from the back and drives a compromiseless to scrap.
In our editorial we will probably have a long time to argue whether this was a blackout of the game designer or whether the authors think us is so stupid.
The technical side is nothing surprising but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
The more annoying is that at some exciting moments, the repeating frequency of images becomes slower and sometimes this is quite dramatic.
However, this concerns, in particular, accidents with a greater number of stakeholders, where there is no benefit from continuous FPS anyway.
The sound reproduction is so far O.K. and the soundtrack is taste.
In an effort to address as wide as possible young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "from everybody" was created - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game would not be weakened by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have argued with the breasttone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game looks somehow incomplete.
For itself a class of pleasures, but you should be prepared to see these errors with the power of airport lighters in your eyes.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of Negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has emptied the balance among the individual institutions."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five, six years until the waves are smoothed and all have become accustomed to their new role," Milena Vicenová, Czech ambassador at the European Union, began quite sharply her lecture at the Jurist Faculty.
How seriously she takes the motto "understood and openly about Europe", she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relationships in such a comprehensible and understandable way that they could have benevolent so many lecturers of the jurist faculty of the Karlsuniversity.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At the beginning, criticism was loud that he was too unobtrusive - a gray official who hadn't grown such a role, but I have to say that it has struck all the breath, how well he has accepted the matter.
"He is a person who is ready to listen patiently to, communicate with, and, above all, has a clear idea of how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained her in response to the question: Who is that really - the European Union? Which number should I call?, i.e., as an important step towards the unification and better readableness of EU policies to states, such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid our oil-produced quarel
Ms Vicenová also devoted itself to the agenda, which the European Union lived, living and intending to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago referred to it as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the presidency referred to it as a major negative factor that had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all the hands to do.
With the words of the ambassador, it was not only the Presidency but also the next crisis that has not been overwhelmed to this day.
And the EU's seven-year budget has yet to be approved, which makes it much more complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries are more and which are less encouraged - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also reminds her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "very understandable about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's horrible shortcuts, foreign words and specialized jargon that no one understands.
As a citizen, I should actually know if you are really crumbling or round cucumbers and different large bananas or whether someone really wants to ban us the quarels.
It would also like to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
The EU ambassador believes that the Czechs are reputed to be Euroscepticians who perceive more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is more angry.
Many factors are due to this, including the retention of our candidates, whose inability to write motivation letters and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, which is called V4.
"Do you believe me when a pole or Hungarian comes to me and is a Slovakian near me, then the Frenchman next to me says: "Hey, what are your heads together - that's your V4 again?" and there's a pretty acidy mine.
According to Mrs Vicenové, the EU expects, in the future, tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As much more real, than a "European Federation" it sees the concept of a Europe of the two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the euro area and the countries outside the euro area here.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of strengthened cooperation."
"The first time it was said that only the countries that want to cooperate and those who do not want it should stand quietly off."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which eventually leads to a strong "Europe of different speeds", Mrs Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues need to be discussed by all the Member States and not only by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM takes place in the second century of his existence
If you wanted to search for a suitable word that characterized the most precise strategy of IBM, this would probably be the word "sustainability".
For the wide public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although it has passed a century since its founding.
The foundation for this longevity already laid her first boss - visionary Thomas J. Watson.
He already met the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a bit.
His slogan "Think!" became a brand mark to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which IBM began to publish in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture which was thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not hesitate to change everything else around.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society throughout our first century.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Translucency system
In the thirty years, Watson had social care for his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Ba
The long-term relationships of IBM with their customers are also highlighted.
From the beginning, the company was ingenious in talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan, which Palmisan is being altered by a woman at the top of IBM next year - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been with IBM for thirty years, so far it took the position of the VET, Marketing and Strategy Chief.
In recent years, IBM has made so-called online brain storms, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - ideas are enough, almost half a million people are busy in the company.
An institution with good reputation
Their unshakable position in business guarantees a strong image to the company and this to the inside and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist Professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony by Consulting-Firma Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference only to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - called in the states of their logo for family "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in one century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers to nanotechnology.
IBM has most patents from all American technology companies and five of his employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
Its most famous inventions include banking machines, credit cards, financial arms, bar code or also the floppy disk.
With about $220 billion (market capitalization), IBM was the second largest technology company (even after Apple) this year, with Microsoft overtaking it for the first time since 1996.
Foregoing
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unhappy, for example, were the attempt with your own OS/2 operating system, the online service prodigy or also the computer IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you can't bind yourself emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem building its basic walls on different platforms - and if they do not work to leave them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, who in principle stands and falls with his Windows operating system.
Success promising technologies
Most of the services, software and hardware are involved in IBM’s profits.
In 1990, hardware was most represented with more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets in value of 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in purchasing future technologies.
IBM continues in these investments after 2008, when the current financial crisis fought for the first time like a storm over the world.
Here too IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the middle of the major world economic crisis.
To date, it seems that the company IBM remains without prejudice to the current crisis.
Since 2008, the value of IBM shares increased by 120 percent rocket-likely and the profit of the company is growing continuously.
IBM's Company Logan is: everything can be changed - only the values cannot be changed.
It should also be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM History: From cheese cutter to world-all flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded a hundred years ago in New York had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM only took over in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies whose history back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They owned technologies such as the famous stech card watches for registration of the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who was also chaired in the Supervisory Board by 1930.
And it was Flint who set up the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him with the management of the company.
This Leader even shaded the founders of IBM - based on Watson's ideas until today, the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as already the name tells, started with the manufacture and distribution of all kinds of machinery for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to boxes.
In the first four decades, Watson led the company, he doubled its turnover to nine million dollars and the company expanded gradually to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he was sitting in the chief chair for for for forty years, only then he was dismissed by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers of NASA helped guide flights into the All – to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous human flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of that time came to the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold his computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of the Company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered into the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying out over the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It embodies the intent to use technologies wisely in areas that have not even been planned, for example to improve the situation in traffic and urban administration.
In the trade sector, IBM recently launched the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help dealers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932 IBM founded a branch in the Czechoslovakia – as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here is also a top research team of world level that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová over her unfaithful husbands:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her spouse Joseph Rychtář (53) had become a lover of the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of life it has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová, singer I. Bartošová, had provided refuge in her own house, she would not even have come in the dream as it was with her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back to ůíčany after 30 days on her pressures, Joseph immediately went with her.
Yes, he even publicly knew he loved them.
In time, Darina resigned, yes, it seemed even as if she wanted to reconcile her unfaithful man - but now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytář doesn't care who sleeps with his wife
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our shared home, then I will not chase him out."
"Everything, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain bonds," Ms. Rychtářová betrayed, but she also said that she has already separated from him emotionally and depends on mutual decency alone.
The fact that Darina locked him the back door, Joseph has so far behaved with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, there's nothing going to change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and that I respect."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I'm making the purchase."
"With Darina, I'm very normal, we just don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, then he doesn't want to prevent them from doing so.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I assume every responsibility.
The worst male women: what about you?
When the men are asked to call some typical female immortals, they shake out of the sleeve without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unsitive revolts pass again that leave men the blood in the veins?
Shopping suit
Does their hole give them a chance to be shopping?
Should you buy at least one hater weekly?
Would you like to go shopping and may it be a little more for actions?
Then, in your case, it really concerns a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping appetite half under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman does it even stop looking for a well-sitting upper clothing just to bumble through a dress shop and not try out at the same time all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told her husband - you'd rather stay out of here...
Permanent Dissatisfaction
"I'm not too thick?"
"I'd have to take off at least five pounds - should I start jogging or make gymnastics?"
"Do I even like you?"
Does that seem known to them?
Yeah?
Then you may also be among the women who are quite obsessed with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let go, but many men respond allergicly when her wife constantly regrets her appearance.
The stronger sex is unanimous - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerant.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Wash windows, tile and dust, shave the waist - and this at least twice a week.
If you squeeze with your partner, because he tramples with dirty shoes on the clean tiles again, do you kick the children because the washbasin is already dirty again and because the glass door at the living room cabinet has already fingerprints, where does polishing make so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", you should know that you should not be exaggerated and that the order and cleanliness in the family life are not first.
This measurable purity mould can ultimately also harm the mutual relationships and, above all, the tranquillity in the family.
Stipples
"Sorry turning pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to dress the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tyrade, don't wonder that it brings him to the palm.
Obviously, this isn't badly meant, they just want that everything has its order.
If the men knew this, the women might not have to mecker so much.
Slip and tracquery
Some women would like to knock and step, get tossed behind their backs or even slandered, or forcing alliances.
Women are focussed on relationships, so they like to pass through such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, every woman of us has a little harmless suit and trach in stock.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women's.
But this is not to be confused with mockery calibers, who are nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and which are a significant danger especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with their assistants to victory
The ice hockey storm Jaromír Jágr played the NHL with two assistants in the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux was a member of the overview of the nine-three-year-old ice hockey star, who was added to the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jágr claimed to journalist that he had prophesied Giroux a big evening.
"Soon before the game I tell him that he manages a Hattrick today."
I felt that somehow."
"In and again, such a feeling comes over," said Jágr, after whose action Giroux already achieved a gate at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech trace".
Voráček fought the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
One second before the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short-hander, but the second third then belonged to the flyers.
Decree Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr, he achieved his third hit, and then Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth gate.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the League, but certainly he's one of the best three," Jágr appreciated his center.
"I wouldn't have noticed in life that I was playing with such an ice hockey player to finish my career as with him."
"I'm very happy."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my fellow players set their game on me and now the spear turns around," smelled Jágr.
Carolina made game a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who went through a penalty shot, it came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any other complication in which he was successful in overnumber of two against one.
"Excellently operated Pronger still in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (read) moved to more remote pounds."
"I tried to meet him and am glad that it has worked," explained Voráček the last hit of the party from his viewpoint.
By this victory Philadelphia sat at the top of the eastern conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and expelled in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experience Beck, the Candiens also blew their leadership a lost penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the penitentiary committees could not transform Tomáš Ortanec.
More than the lost points, the trainer of the home team probably pained the high disease-related failure in the defensive – the game they played only with five defense players.
"That's bad."
"We played the encounter with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to do with that," said Jacques Martin.
"On each change a wave of attack after another and we didn't have anything to do with it."
"We had to make the game easier and get the puck out of our third."
There were reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech gatekeeper Ondřej Pavelec resisted thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
In the gates of the jets, which finished a series of five defeats, five different shelters were involved.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorized public offices in the ČSSR: Čedok, sports artist, CKM, Rekrea and autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies sold only travels to the socialist Eastern Block countries, and in the West only elected.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a prowess course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even citizens of the East Block (also the Czechoslovakia) allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
At that time travel agencies also offered travel to the West, but they had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag before the travel office, or at least have "good acquaintances" at the travel agency.
That's the way the thing has not gone for a long time.
The so-called exchange allowance - the condition for a trip to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would not have been possible to impose the necessary financial resources (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most Czechs therefore spent their vacation in the domestic, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The summit revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the extent of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which is no longer aware of today, is the fact that one could not travel to the Czech most popular holiday country until 1989, because it was part of the Yugoslavia of that time.
Especially from the beginning of the 90s of the past century, currency commitment was lifted into the neighbouring Western European countries, which caused a huge wave of short visits to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't get enough from their journeys to the West for a long time, at least everybody wanted to have been there a few days.
Thus, the Czech holidaymakers slept on travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who had already had the money for a accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of foreign travel from Czechs was then a suitcase full of conservation, beer and durable worst, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of life, and thus the average salaries also increased, which in 1997 took place at another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demands for travel, travel agencies began to prepare regular trips by charter flights after 1997, making it incredibly cheaper for flight trips thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantitative discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, had already devised payments with all the highly developed countries in the world, making travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-samten" travelling came in 2000 when the high demand for the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was made - to Thailand.
Since then, every year, direct charter aircraft fly with Czech passengers in far away sunny countries; this year, 12 exotic destinations are directed from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd Czechs travel every year to exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the epoch, which marked our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17th, 2008, the USA abolished the visa obligation for Czech tourists, which definitively ranked our country among the highly developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15 Tsd. CZK per capita for a single holiday stay, including the cost of holiday.
The General Assembly is intended to find a new Chairman - again a Patt threatens.
For almost five months, the Czech football has not been chairman and threatens that Ivan Hašek's successor at the head of the Czech football association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
To date, there is no agreement on what election order is to be chosen.
And without this there is no vote on the three potential successors at all.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his function, as he asked his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era of Hašek, the old quarels between the two association chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People's House in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the negotiations did not result in any outcome, and not only was the choice itself.
It is not even possible to agree on who is actually voting - only the statutory representatives or also the functionaries equipped with a power of power.
At least partial agreement was reached in this single point, including the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose representatives on the basis of power are not acceptable.
However, the disputes relating to the order of election continue to continue.
The Executive Committee also brought no more clarity to the matter, which, regardless of whether or not or not, in principle has nothing else on the agenda.
Even though the views on the election changed several times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is, how should you do in the third round to avoid a Patt situation?
"The issue concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the statute or whether to find a completely different model," stated Dušan Svoboda, one of the three deputy presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in the management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round of the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is candidate.
Mooring is supposedly ready to take into account the compromise that the candidate will victory the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, exists on the condition that the winner receives at least one two-third majority in this percentage voting count.
"Then the two front rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the entire two chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would find it best not to impose the order of election but to choose according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees with this, even though it appears that Pelta is most likely to meet all the candidates' order of election.
"My wish is that it is widely elected after the statute."
"Because no irradiated substitution variants are designed, as at the last meeting," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time candidates and delimited himself in his opinions primarily to Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believes that the new Chairman will be known in Nymburk and that he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football-EM today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
"If the football only rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says Jablonec's functionar, who brings the greatest experience from all three adepts and this at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reluctant.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately decisive."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Morning, but there are some efforts to "reprove" the rules for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a re-blocking is not excluded at the General Assembly."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human mind will finally victory," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to agree with all sides no longer remains.
Some of the negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether soccer genericity will be complete until the game of qualifications.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance, and was searched for a substitute variant, how to bring some of the executive committee to the location of the barrage-hind game.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to be coming on Wednesday, is certainly crucial.
Josef Dobeš, Minister for Schools, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the country's largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state contributions, the trustworthyness of the Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which is supposed to turn the new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the President's position because he does not see any appropriate candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary meeting, could have made up a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have been able to fight for this top position at all.
"If there were a good lawyer, I would fight for him and refuse to choose."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the supposed favorites of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
In the event of his victory, Paclík also emphasizes that he intends to perform the function of the Chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary General Assembly.
In the position of the Chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much twisted into football events.
"With some people in question I have spoken personally."
"Well to believe that some told me they didn't want to identify themselves with the Czech football at this time.
"These views would like to be changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík claims to disturb Pelta's connection with the president of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation that is regarded as a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votings on general meetings.
For Paclík it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta would have the president's position.
"With his victory, the present state would be preserved, and in the Czech football it wasn't going ahead at all."
"The support by Berbr, a smart businessman, would be twice bad for the football," Paclík stressed.
He also insists on the fact that Pelta's name was some time ago in connection with telephone hearings to investigate a corruption affair, but that Pelta was uncriminal.
"I don't know what prestige should bring a victory of Pelta to the (th.) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řecl Paclík, who said his previous pronunciation, "he will sell the pilsner football club if Pelta becomes Chairman", but already sees something more silent.
However, if Paclík wins in the Thursday election, he could quite imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Likewise, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the General Assembly in October, who ended with a Fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would go."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him well, for example, as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who had taken care of the upsight in September that he was substituting for the defeat of the arbitration committee with Lu ěk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the member of the association.
And call for his abilities in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also Chief of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the League with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"To limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and occupational commissions, which is experiencing in disturbing situations," said Paclík, who does not make a hedge of his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta Chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby the political leaders for more money flowing from the lottery tax into sports.
"This is one of the crucial things the new Chairman should devote himself."
"If it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but they must also tell clearly where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club is also not considered to be a handicap, although he himself stresses that the Chairman of the FAČR must be "overparty".
Pelta is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"However, I think it doesn't make much sense to transmit my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third-party person to return back after one and a half years," Paclík cleared.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will exclude a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Office of Presidents, Miroslav Pelta, promised that he would make himself strong in the case of his choice for the FAČR to obtain new statutes that in the future exclude disputes on the electoral order of advance.
The functioner of Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election struggle will be safely deteriorated in a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the unrealised election in September, he wanted to concentrate on the national team in the event of his election and the acquisition of financial resources.
He decided to take part in the election before the last meeting, and so the two-month break was able to help him defend his ideas about the leadership of football and present it in a wider context.
"Leutes at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the Chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the highest time for the association to be led by someone, the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who also operated many years with Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Only at the General Assembly in June, statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as they were all accepted.
If they hadn't allowed different interpretations, we had already had a chairman from September onwards", said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Association that he used as a locking tool for the delegates.
"If I become Chairman, then I take it personally and are willing to bear personal responsibility if it fails."
"This is a fundamental thing without which he can't be," Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not try to limit himself to his counterparts.
He had previously announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, which he acknowledged because of his legal education, and he well knows that his opponent would be his first alternate.
Tomáš Paclík has long not been attacking, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has already moved over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
"But his attacks were deteriorating, and many people were shocked by his campaign."
"So many doubt about his real character," addressed Pelta to his contradictor, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations, which he said in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes of play, to the national team.
And this should be the Czech soccer sign.
"I would also endeavor to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the imtudes of the corruption scandal last year."
"Equally after that, I would fall into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient financial resources for the whole football," said the six-fifty-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the tip of the Czech football would not mean any personal cleaning.
"I should first get familiar with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where the long anarchy makes sense of nervousness.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios accompanying the upcoming General Assembly, he believes that on Thursday the delegates do not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If really should be the only conflicting point as you choose in the third round, then we get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins back if he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR begins working hard among him
If the former Deputy Chairman Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new Chairman of the Czech Football Association, this would supposedly prevent many people in the Association.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice one starts working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual soccer areas.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football, and otherwise to continue the work that the previous chairman of Ivan Hašek began.
"As Chairman, I want to devote myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, from national selection, professional football, to performance football for young people."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football in each segment comes forward with miles."
Many wouldn't be really enthusiastic about this because, instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start really hard to work themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the soccer movement, it has taken into account not to compete at all.
"From me is known that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who do not throw me freely between the legs and question any step I'm doing," he said as a explanation why he has delayed.
"But many people told me that I shouldn't give up because others would do it."
"That's trust that one can't play," he said.
It is said that he is also motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've managed a big piece of work, and I don't want to just throw it away."
"There were processes started that were probably only valid in a few years and I would only be unfortunate to see that she stopped someone," he said, expressing his concerns that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected - the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Hinter him stands, especially people who would make the football so that he would only be there for the chosen one."
I guess you can suggest some, but not that I would be participant."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because it's all good and not just the chosen one," Rajchl observed.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really want to do the best possible for mooring."
"For example, it is time to consider whether you should not divide the league into a Czech and Moravian part, whose winners then rose to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the League, which is a problem especially for young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the Chief of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has joined the Chairman's struggle for the function of the Chairman, Rajchl is not convinced to assess his chances of being elected.
"I have a strong support in the Czech Chamber, who has chosen me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl, who also views the saving of ten million crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the Lottery Law as its success.
On the other hand, he is partly blamed for the association not taking a single stand.
While he says of Pelta, "he is disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football to reliably reliably," he considers the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who really has to offer something to the football.
"Nobody can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he had been elected, he would probably continue the things Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the personal occupation in the Commissions he would obviously not change in principle."
He would certainly not want to turn things to his favor," judges Rajchl of his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Planning pools in Ufo-Optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a city tour or hiking, rest the tired legs in spray baths.
A book shows where wellness is most beautiful in water.
If Iris Meder went on search trips over the past one and a half years, one in her baggage was not allowed to miss: her bathing suit.
lying back on the water, she looked high in artificially designed domes, they swim marble puts waiting on the pelvis rim, and amazed over acribically restored youth style swim halls.
She liked a bathroom, she took it flight in her notebook - together with knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiastic.
With sports she doesn't have much at the hat, says Meder - only in the water is that different.
Unfortunately only that swim fans have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine steaks, while Jogger can breathe the fragrant fragrance of fiche forests or cheerful bird twins in the park.
"On a day I wondered why swimming pools should always be so ugly," says the Mede living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubles architecture
Plasters in the spring basin and essential sauna oil - the wellness factor in baths is so large because all senses are used, according to Meder.
And if the builders have made effort, swimming halls can be a true eye smell: "The place of a floor is a water surface in baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles visually: high clouds, colorful tiles, jumpboards.
The small-format image band "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages of knowledge about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but especially makes a jump into blue.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool collector Meder in her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-resistant water in an original Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal pool filled with alkali-resistant water and located in a bottled building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in the eye from the Zurich roof pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window that can be watching the drifting on the ski piste.
The most extraordinary pool design awaits bathing in lengthenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo landed right in the Alps.
From three upstairs open shells it damps in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal are racing into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder rose the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell for sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so strongly after heating oil, which one hardly believes to be landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogen carbonate-resistant healing water, which is almost black and whose sleeve sticks one on the skin as soon as you get to the basin - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 has now been closed.
When Meder threw a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow youth-style building, she saw how weeds grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, the decay has been counteracted in a magnificent swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction already have this bathroom; you can discover not only neoromanical elements that come from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a maurical hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of the pool-genent Iris Meder - not only because it originates from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to merge different designs into such a great unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, the diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a side thing.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank allows raw materials business to lighten through
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank abandon its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the Chief of the Group wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the German citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans according to a study find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business, as it tightens the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Consumer Organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets at the global raw material stock exchanges increase prices - and that is why the banks have a co-debt to the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protectionists is specifically directed against German-Bank Chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw materials laws were intended to secure traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the zockers have disconnected from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to check the accusations and said that no business was "value to put the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank at risk".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the examination will be completed, and the results will be presented to the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bank, together with recommendations on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank's top then wants to inform what consequences it draws.
At the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete retreat.
Ackermann bastards on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The bet on rising prices of foods shows particularly dramatic how unspoilt banks today harm the general well."
Ackermann is now a top bank lobbyist in particular in the obligation.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all the plants from its portfolio where money is used for bets on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is dealing with hunger suffering people or with the Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Ackermann's insight is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Chief of the Group wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday the Deutsche Bank announced that the Executive Board Head will not switch to the Supervisory Board differently than planned.
With a retreat from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses he hardly needs to shave himself - it would eventually have to do with his successor.
Each second would terminate raw materials plants
Foodwatch tries to keep the pressure on the manager high.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute of Forsa surveyed on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
Accordingly, just 11 percent think it is legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which prices are waged for food.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: each second would terminate the survey of all the plants in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would depreciate acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent reported to think about quitting their account and switching to another institution.
21 house in Vienna
The Retracted Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 rang prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disappeared.
Now he is reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern post-war architecture is swarmed by clear shapes, glasses of halls, courageous swine and new building materials typical of belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and famous example for the Brüssler World Exhibition 1958.
At the time, Schwanzer Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for his light and floating steel-glass construction.
The construction is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He announced the architect that he also built at the next world exhibition of Austria Pavilion.
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinder House plus a cocktail-like side building in Munich, he was finally internationally famous in 1973.
After the world exhibition in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South Railway Station, Pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was set up, rebuilt and opened in 1962 a 20th-century museum - the 20th-century house was called it.
But the building was not suitable for spatial and technical as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krishanitz has rebuilt the Pavilion, he is now called "21 of the house" and is now used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening the Museum Belvedere, which belongs to the house, opens the first exhibition - a lucky thing in every respect.
The new beginning Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has been implemented.
Husslein-Arco, promoved art historian with remarkable career, including in youth as an ice art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, strongly pursued the reconstruction of politicians and monumental protectors, she acquired public funds and private sponsor funds and set the use.
Apart from present art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the founding of the same name, a café and a book shop should exist, and an office house had to be built.
Strong oversight, small budget
For the implementation, Krishanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and gained the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was a "incredibly important place" for him, where he had looked at the exhibitions "fast every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building that already lost when he moved to Vienna and his use of generousness and ease.
There were far greater problems in the current reconstruction: the building was "an energy gun", says Krishanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were alternated, glass fiber-resistant insulation glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two underfloors brought place for the new use, a lowered light grave between house and road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still the light bulb pavilion.
The original outdoor doors are left, the house is stripped in the old red-brown rusty color tone.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as he was before.
And all of this under strict supervision of the Memorial Authority and with small food.
"Sometimes a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked to the Memorial Protection Office," says Krishanitz and points to a rowy floor on the bottom floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstructions, the building has remained flexible and easily.
It was difficult with the Pavilion, "that came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-City history".
Such an architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "create a real consciousness".
In this case, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it has entered a city-building lucky situation: around the Swiss garden just the completely new "main train station" quarter, with office and housing houses.
And another lucky thing may happen: the 21st house could be strengthened by another Krishanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berliner temporary Kunsthalle, and as you hear, she already negotiates with the city for a neighbourhood location in the Swiss garden.
Train plants winter crises package in millions of height
The railway has exposed a crisis plan that is intended to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train losses and delays, Deutsche Bahn adds to a newspaper report more than 70 million euros this year.
The "Picture" newspaper pre-reported on an internal crisis plan for the Group, that investments of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
This aims to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to dominate internal and external employees for snow removal on rail stations and to increase trains to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free rail strollers from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of the operation and 90 percent of the necessary working weeks.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, train chief Rüdiger had warned against train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, the train in passenger transport has had considerable problems, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the railway Federal Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also created for years that it has to have axes of ICE trains examine significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axle break at the Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the USA
After the tumult around Chief Josef Ackermann, new inconvenience comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million penalty there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry's giant still has its past in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to clarify disputes due to the plague of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The Financial Market Regulator NCUA proposes a whole range of large banks that have led cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have played the risks down.
Such papers lost greatly in value during the financial crisis, and the banks plunged into depth.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the topic without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not confer any debt on the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the presence of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. co-operative banks and jumps into Pleiten to protect the customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to replace the caused billions of serious damage.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regular had also set up other large banks and in summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The relevant mortgage papers are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on house loans.
When the U.S. property bubble broke in 2007, this became a variety of financial companies to be hungry.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers turned around.
Even though the events have been back for several years, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have endeavoured countless complaints to obtain re-establishment or to disclose infringements.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of action.
It suggests 18 international large banks that two US property financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have overestimated mortgage transactions in volumes of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to appeal to the FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurters to be straightforward for "essential losses", but without specifying a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unsustainable and explained that they wanted to resist.
Warren Buffet increases with 10 billion at IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests strongly in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the major American investor Warren Buffett had always explained not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies can only be predicted badly.
But now he had read the business reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and provides computer systems for the IT divisions of other companies.
A investment by Warren Buffett is considered a ridder in the financial world.
As a result, the IT original rock IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now revealed in CNBC that he had purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a 5.5 percent share.
Buffett said that even IBM did not know something about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that, even in the economic crisis, still provided for proper profits.
"You have made a great job," Buffett said on the strategy.
IBM has been using lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time.
The over 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful corporate calculators.
Buffett had better avoided technology companies until now.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett attacked at a cargo railway, with a lubricant manufacturer or machine manufacturer.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns around 80 own subsidiaries in a whole series of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and developed it with smart investments to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost inconsistent sense of earning money has brought him the nickname "Orakel von Omaha".
After the Buffett investment became known, the IBM share increased by one percent in advance.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion in the total stock exchange and is therefore one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, together with Apple and Microsoft.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, but he didn't want to go in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubt at the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that now resurrects.
The murders of eight Turkish immigrants and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a legal extremist background.
This message will be reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German doors, a long-faithed specimen returns: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with legal extremist background against Turkishs.
The fact that there is hostility in Germany has never been in question.
However, the uncovered right extremist network reveals dimensions, whose dimension is far from visible.
"Does bloody ideology reappear?" titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the offenders should have been a V man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the legal radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded in a sense: on the weekend she remembered the victims of racist violence with a guard in front of the Brandenburg gate.
Only two weeks before, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a festival of the fiftyth anniversary of the German-Turkish procurement agreement.
In cheerful colors, the intercourse had been staged as a story of success.
Like an ear fig, the reporting of some Turkish media: "German gift for the fifty" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hurriyet" cannot be taken to draw this thoughtful link.
"It begins to stink," says the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people were murdered who paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
Most critically, in German-Turkish Internet Forums, the action of the police and their subsequent success of the investigations will be discussed.
The authors wonder why the German authorities were not much more interested in looking for suspects in legal extremist circles.
Some of them are at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: "If they continue to be glued here, the migrants remain nothing but self-defense and arms".
"That will be the best self-protection."
"From the kindness of clarification and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network, inner peace in Germany depends very strongly," says "Selen".
What it means when inner peace in Germany is in danger is demonstrated the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties.
The photo of the solingen fire ruins is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turkishs living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can be forced into right violence.
However, the attacks sharpened the wire feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at that time, the failure of German policy was particularly impressed by the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack by Solingen, he sent a condolence gramme to the Turkish Presidents, but at the grief celebration in Cologne, he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then counted on how many charges the local Turks made.
The value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks has since been in the local rule of law.
In addition to the efforts of extensive information and re-evaluation of legal extreme terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The Scandal Bank of Zurisee
The most adventurous bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then has been slipping from a crisis to the next.
Now a German is supposed to judge it.
Axel Weber wouldn't have thought of that.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost as spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Großbank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, Switzerland praised whether its beauty and the UBS were their newly gained solidarity and made friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has done the turnaround."
"I look forward to cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September, it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A retailer of the UBS in London had crashed all bank security systems and reconciled some EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a not only famous banker in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has also been dealt with - and all questions: When does Axel Weber finally come?
It was already known that Weber was allowed to advise the Bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the Management Board in May, not only in 2013, as the Bank notified on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it's gonna be hard.
He is not a banker, rather an economic professor and a note banker and would certainly have needed a working time.
With a blow, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title "Bigest Scandal Bank of Europe".
Because the UBS is, on the one hand, huge - until recently, it was the world's largest assets manager - and has been slipping from a scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid but also exhausted Swiss assets managers combined her with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a very large number in investment banking as well.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed more money of customers with 1.6 billion dollars than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it was introduced into the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-term bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: "My students have always put the UBS as a pattern of a good bank at that time."
"On the basis of today's views, how could I only mislead myself?"
He was seriously mistaken.
For the first time in 2007, it was apparent that something belongingly slept in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, director Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who was up to then considered a highly intelligent and even genial banker.
A few months later, one knew why he had gone.
The bank's investment savings had been reconciled with subprime papers and had to resign billions.
In order to educate this, the UBS announced a capital increase of say and write 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, but those who had just been roasting the nose: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so silent that they did not even know his name.
But that was only the first hit.
It was worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, the Swiss Board of Directors, which was the second paid in 2006.
The catastrophe followed in October 2008: the UBS was preceded by the collapse and had to be saved from the state in view of its failure to invest in the financial crisis.
The National Bank purchased the UBS for thirty billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced change bond that she could become co-owner of the Bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses so large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the size of Switzerland's economic performance (see graphics).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says bank researcher violin.
The first catastrophe joined the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and declared ready to issue the data of customers of assets who may have deducted taxes from the bank using the aid of the Bank.
In addition, it agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these businesses and a penalty charge.
Thus, the UBS knew more or less openly to have helped with tax impediment.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of Silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of Head of Management and President of the Administrative Council.
And the Exodus of Customer Moneys.
Thus, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: investment banking through failure speculations and asset management by helping to reduce taxes.
And just when it got a little calmer, just as one thought the UBS would get it back now, this uneven dealer story follows: A single dealer reconciles €1.7 billion before the bank notices that something is wrong.
And it seems that with risk management in investment banking, it still does not work.
"In the case of Adoboli, it has to be found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economist and Financial Professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not handle risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago joined in becoming guardians of the world's great assets: no too big risks, security for money - it was also like to break the world apart from the Alpine Republic.
The Tresores of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of irregular reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich even fits the cliché of the thieved Swiss private bank - it is only a bit larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters on the Zurich railway road, which leads from the main train station directly to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are splendid, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditions such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
The Swiss banks have been residing here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Beär.
The reception hall of the UBS can be accessed by a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are marble clothed, there are thick leather seats, next to the bank logo a large sign to the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank have both Swiss large banks, UBS and credit suisse, but sometime - or tell them how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not like to read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he also makes business with the two large banks.
The UBS has become much too large, it finds it - especially in investment banking, where the fishing axles would also have spread.
The Swiss don't have anything to say there anymore.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the habits of the fishing axles."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking, which changed the UBS, gave her first high profits and then the Debakel: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small Seven Millions Country decided the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros, the politicians agreed to save the large bank in front of the bankruptcy.
How could it be?
If you speak to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined a huge group.
It was created by a bank that was too large at the merger for small Switzerland - and grew on and on.
The two different precursor banks of the UBS were complemented: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on assets management in Zurich and a poorer but more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers received a lot of money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise by the UBS: Peter Wuffli, Group Chief of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellect, modest person who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the stomach man who has worked up from the banking teaching to the top."
But at the end, Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Surely, excess of humility came before the case.
Employees of the UBS remember clearly the leadership meetings on which Group Chief Wuffli repeatedly issued the same parole: Goldman Sachs rushed from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She cited the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps have already been successful.
In the exchange business and in the stock trade, she played upstairs.
Business advisors who were commissioned, however, showed a weakness: in the international interest transaction, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry after growth, the Bank invested both itself and a hedge fund established before it in American subprime plants.
It developed into a huge machine that packed securities on American mortgage credits and continued - but also kept risks.
Also, when other banks had long been looking for the exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says bank experts violin.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go than the attempts to clear up more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS became the locker seat and are blurred up to this day.
Whoever leads the big bank now has a almost impossible job.
It needs to find a strategy for a bank that has managed all the nearby business models.
Bank researcher Geiger has already got an idea: close with investment banking, concentration on the assets management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go (now) to this extent.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
The next Thursday, the new Head of Bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present its future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Switzerland was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the Bank surprisingly separated from predecessors Grübel.
In the meantime, he has been engaged: he is to continue the business of the UBS, the Zurich Bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the stand in the middle of the nineties.
He stretches 3500 places.
But that's not gonna be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask.
Publicly, he only says so far that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens US stock exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has encouraged the US investors for the weekly period.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without force.
The drowned industrial production on the continent embroiled the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens was not possible.
The euro fell compared to the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass had still golden as half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems were in the foreground again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard values noted for trade with a minus 0.6 percent at 12.078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer spread between 12.027 and 12.170 points.

The index of the Nasdaq technology market lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax agreed with a minus of 1.2 percent in 5985 counters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is at the end of the upturn.
The companies produced two percent less than in the previous month in September, as the Eurostat Statistical Office reported.
The US investors found this skeptical: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there will be additional signs of weakness in banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore too early to invest in European government bonds or banks from his viewpoint.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades old principle on the hills and entered the US technology industry.
His investment over $10 billion in IBM supported the share rate of the traditional group and initially made it note nearly one percent higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has, according to its own information, paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share rate of its investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America's shares decreased significantly more by 2.6 percent than the market.
The house simplifies almost the rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and pays $6 billion for it.

At the Nasdaq, in turnovers of 1.38 billion shares 630 in Plus, 1913 in Minus and 82 were unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places seed herbs are regarded as "problem birds": but from the cities the high-intelligent animals can no longer be displaced, claims experts.
One of them likes them, the other wants to get rid of them very quickly: Crowns have been part of the city’s image for centuries, but in many municipalities residents are putting up complaints about dirt and noise of the animals.
A means against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows were no longer available from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian empty.
There experts from all over the Federal Territory advised about possible routes.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature protectors also led the problems in cities to the landflight of the specially protected seeds: the chemistry use in agriculture increasingly destroys the traditional habitats.
The hunting, growing cultivation and the falling of typical breeding trees made the birds hard to live.
Crowns are under nature protection.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs include in the Westphalia Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen and in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the massive killing of crows in the district of Negative Headlines had taken place.
Criters had called the catch of animals in bird traps and the striking of knocks particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the murmuring, doesn't bring anything," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver found out empty.
Sharing nests with water or falling trees, often have unwanted consequences, also said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals deviate, large colonies split up and distribute themselves in other places."
Exclusion is only possible as an exception to hospitals, pensions or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't get them away anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable to be a combination of horrors of animals from sensitive housing areas and locking offers to relocate them in other places.
"Infoboards instead of chain saws", on the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologian Uta Maria Jürgens was for a completely different handling of the animals: "We can endure a pickle in our face with the best self-consciousness."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had founded the Ashberger Crown-Lehrpfad to inform the signs of the life of the highly intelligent seeds.
The project has already been adopted by tourists.
To criticize the noise of the birds, Jürgens also had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication that has a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed herbs use not only tools to get to a delicious bite, but even produce their tools as a tool.
Conduct researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed herbs, as far as the intelligence of the birds is concerned.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring stones to the collapse in order to reach a motten larvae.
Without much training, they determined the size and shape of a stone must have to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the spicy crows had to solve a more smart problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small egg with a motten larve.
With the snail, the birds couldn't reach their prey.
However, the researchers had placed them wirepieces.
From that all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then charged the oak on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seeds even succeeded in hiding.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks on a coup remained.
The favorites of Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are at EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have released the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Introduced by the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal struck Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participant perfect after the 0:0 in the play.
The Czechs had a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off back game at the outer side of Montenegro, after the play (2:0) had been a clear thing.
Nothing more burned Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland loosened 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Held Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) achieved further results for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the Play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to Portugal.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal caught a start according to measure.
Ronaldo chased a 30-metre release for early lead.
A good quarter hour later Nani showed his broad-shot qualities and met from 25 meters at 2:0.
The Bosnians who did not take place in the first half hour had their first clear chance by Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-wolfsburger of the English table leader Manchester City placed a headball at the bottom of the Latte, but the ball did not cross the gateway (33.).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
==References====External links==
After a attack against Held Postiga in the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trader after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which was safely transformed by Misimovic.
After the break, however, the Vizeeuropa champion of 2004 made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
In 1976, the European champion went to the EM for the fifth time.
However, the team of Trainer Michal Bilek with Bundesliga-Legionar Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) also had happiness and had to survive a horror certificate in the beginning phase.
Endmann Petr Cech, with a reflex at the last moment, prevented a possible own gate by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot by the 40th minute from the rotation of the penitentiary boundary just near the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crossroads had to save for the already hit world class station of the Czechs, again the storm of the FC Seoul had detracted (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made it clear.
Turkey therefore missed Zagreb's soccer wonder.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go beyond 0:0 in Zagreb.
While National Trainer Guus Hiddacht has to do so as safely to clear its place on the bank of the World Cup Third of 2002, the Croatians are allowed to enjoy their fourth participation in an EM final round.
Before 31.000 viewers in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance shot only the pistol, attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't in the gate.
After the horror, however, Croatia became more and more in control.
Even after the break, the Croatians did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who took place for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62st minute, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern München) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Introduction Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni drives to EM
In Dublin, the Irish have celebrated the first EM participant in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of Trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already managed a pre-decision in the 32th minute with the 4:0 success in the playback.
Constantin Vassiljev (57.) like the guests.
Ireland pushed to the pace from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23th minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian team prevent the possible leadership hit.
But in the 32th minute it was done.
After an unfortunate defense of Endmann Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball at 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the next years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about EUR 1.5 billion) are supposed to flow, the Dax Group informed on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and set up staff accordingly," announced Co-Chef Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The staff is supposed to grow from around 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers are located in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the 2015 Dax Group Strategy.

"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China through comprehensive information."
Mass slaughter at a personal level
Sensitive and generous Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Fear. A history of the First World War, tells in nineteen fate halls" with a long list of main individuals that go to your heart.
Here's a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
They will get to know these people in Englund's romantic story very well. And these main people will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments, where you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and your illusions are robbed.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he did not incorrectly describe as "a work of the Anti-History".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It's about "sensitivity, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Schönheit und Schrecken" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unobtrusive men and women together on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanics to mountain climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office staff.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, lose members, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives flippes like the vocabulary ceremonies in one church, some come on, while others eradicate.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the West Front.
"Beauty and fear" migrates with expert views of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on bee baskets, a celebrated Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsets are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina who smells for Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her children, and cannon fires in the distance. Stay or take the escape?
Who's coming at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happens or why this war is actually being conducted.
"Felling facts," says Englund, "were furnished with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, night dreams and revelations."
"Schönheit und Schrecken" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmate.
Their stories were mainly collected memories, letters and other already published material.
Their life reports can be terrifying or thrilling, but they are extremely alive in Englunds of the collection of small moments lost in details.
Many of them act of lack and help themselves.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replace, everywhere."
"Replace caffee, false aluminum, false radier gum, paper bonds, wood buttons."
He tells more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "flesh made of compressed rice and baked in hammle fat (and was last served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes sold with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food replacements that were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee replacements."
Some stories act of honor and foolishness.
An American recognizes his own urge for wildness and says about the war: "You feel that despite all that was intended for men to sit in the chair, with the evening sheet or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, and so doing as to mean such a façade of civilization and as if there were no barbarians behind your own strengthened and defeated shirt chest."
In turn, a British soldier recognizes that he probably dies and nobody will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you take distance from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think this happens before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it's as terrible as "a condemned man hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition," says Englund, "a war between the factories."
He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the young age," "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the suit that kills while he sits behind a desk."
People act in an unforeseen way and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to get infected with a prostitute with a sex disease to escape front service.
"The grandistic expression of it can be discovered in trade with Gonokokken eggs, because soldiers bought and smothered on their genetiles in the hope of coming to the hospital," he writes.
"Jongs who were really desperate have rubbed him in their eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves Englund's poetry becomes smooth, yet unindulgably and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "found uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to wonder why their leaders bring them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly distorted like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional celebrity hall.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book.
I don't give it back anymore.
But it's as if with his book he had caught this side with the main persons from the nose and fired us with a string of wood.
After an early failure a minutely planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the use of some of them.
One had decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at this time, few people are in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. All others at first believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepperspray against protesters, which violates the rules of the cerebral, and the household owners abounded a huge increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zucotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A catastrophe exercise had taken place with a view of Zucotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to enter the park came "in the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the commands, what was said for a declaration as "exercising".
"The few police who were involved in my knowledge did not know that it was about the Zucotti Park," said one who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about the Zucotti Park were the high-ranked officials of the Ressort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then returned when hundreds of protesters met after they had learned about these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including commissions from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials, which are usually used in high-criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the course of the day many people go in and out in the park, almost like pendlers, so that 1 o'clock at night is a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people stay in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready to leave the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the news recorded in advance that drowned from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When public officials ran into the park in their bright blue wind jackets, many protesters simply robbed their things together and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 a.m., no tents would be taken to give the protesters time to pack their possessions and good together.
Other teams of officials have been seen how they gathered in the area to intervene should become necessary arrests in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman of the police president, said this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the handling of officials was very rough.
Mr. Browne said that television cars could have taken photos in Church Street on the west side of the park.
When the police moved towards the west through the great confusion of personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial grasses and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, which had been lifted up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged out. Images of this appeared on the Internet just a short time later.
A main core of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were tied to their arms.
And two people chained themselves on trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Officials of civil protection were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park by about 3:30 p.m.
The remembrance was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police's statements.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests came, as he said, because of "inappropriate behavior and resistance to a arrest".
The most prominent official on site was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the department, the highest uniform of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly did not "lead" the operation, as Mr. Browne said.
In case they had to access, a second group of officials waited on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was possible to observe how these police stations expanded around the Zucotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with protective signs, were observed to drive people outside.
Around 28 people were in the north.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 o'clock south of Pine Street a protester jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tyre of a police bus.
In one place, the amount threw a piece of blocking wood.
At the end, an official and a protestant came to the hospital.
Trade union of the maintainer will file a complaint against the city for dismissal
The trade union, which represents hundreds of school officials who have lost their work last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, since the dismissal due to its inappropriate influence on schools that teach poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last possibility that the trade union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to remedy the releases.
Six hundred and seventy school workers, coordinators and other employees who were among the poorest paid employees in the city and had lost their work in a chess on October 7th, described the trade union leader as political revenge that last year the city had refused access to a health fountain that the working groups had to close the budget gaps.
This accusation was rejected by the authorities in a categorical manner.
At a hearing of the City Council Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the discharges were part of the budget that one had adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that there was nothing specific in the budget that employees would be released from school assistance.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the application of the appeal is formally announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City will be accused of the complaint and will count eight dismissed workers as applicants who are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the Ministry of Justice of the City, said that the city did not submit the complaint and thus could not be commented on their individual claims.
According to a draft complaint submitted by the New York Times, the trade union concentrated on the number of dismissalses at the schools in the poor districts of the city to support a complaint for inequality treatment. It claims that poor schools had lost more helpers because they were chronically underfunded.
It explains that while there were no dismisses on Staten Island and only few dismisses in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school workers in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, lost and 46 helpers were released in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school workers who were employed at the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of tricky parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. Moreover, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculation for extra financing for each poor school registration.
The trade union also complains that the heads of high schools were led by the language in a memo which approved the release of the support coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: transmit) in the USA usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school available to a pool of workers who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six coordinators were released, not transmitted," the draft complaint states.
Mission completed, Congress ready to discuss Libya
Finally, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington already agreed on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the rebels, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee for International Relations decides a resolution under the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), with Libya being praised for the successful rebellion and American troops for their "Mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
Language may sound innocent, but nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House argued about the election of a number of resolutions on the approval or disagreement of the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution which approved the restricted use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide margin of the parties and there was no vote.
But the same day this law passed in the Senate. Furthermore, the Chamber passed a decision to cut the funds for American operations in Libya.
This led the US mission to a kind of legislative featherfire - with a convention that was insulted enough to criticize Obama's approach in the context of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull him away the floor under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of the Congress was overwhelmed by the events.
Tripolis fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and their exceptional endurance in their self-freedom" and praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support by the Board of Foreign Relations, or will they divide the legislators, as did the Law of June?
The last version is the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republic of the committee.
Lugar's speaker said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is on the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change which demands a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every conventional legislative period of the Republicans and some democrats.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or any other area that is currently being voted at the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far failed to try to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte change is just one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to this Congress and cover a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate - others are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget change alone in the senate and another dozen that would "control public expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners to the Republicans who want to pollute their circulation - the opportunity to budge with such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, which was adopted in August, requires that both Senate and Congress vote on a change in budget balance.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that may be made by members of the Congress, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to abolish the limitation to two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among gender equality is as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eager as Members propose changes, they are moving as faster as they have been in recent years.
At the 111th Congress, legislator presented 77 such changes. at the 110th Congress 66.
The pace leaves in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly propose more than 150 changes every two years, the figures provided by the Senates Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment which is to be added - the 27. - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Featured, but Not Defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after shooting a armed man from the nearest distance during a election event in Tucson, the Republicaner Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared in the national television Monday evening. She singed alone to the Broadway branch "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than that of returning to the convention.
When she joined Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she ran in words and needed help in walking.
The mission showed the heavy slow recovery of the damage that the bullet dividing its skull has caused through the left side of its brain and has crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to the convention to give her voice triumphantly to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "silent".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) answered: "All right."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, Astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special that was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The Special pursues Gifford's recovery since the attack of January 8th.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, they are seen in the hospital bed, with a cold shaved head and a long scarf over the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nick with your head.
A cock with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: One sees how the congress member sings together with the therapists at Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours of therapy daily, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12 he had read an article of a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time for the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The suspected protector Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is necessarily treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hart, heart, heart."
During the healing of his wife, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?" said Kelly.
You've only been hit.
And you will endure this and you will recover and you will come back more than ever before.
Trups feel pity rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The amount in black smokes stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation action in spring.
A ranked military officer on the Gala, who was observed, among other things, by the Chief of the Staff and then Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphan children," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, really not, it was pity.
The cracking contradictory impressions illustrate the severe relationship between the military and the most distanzed, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overcrowded with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise has its prize, say service members.
The public is increasingly acting as if you did people in uniform suffering.
"We weren't a victim at all," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The topic is extremely sensitive to military leaders who want to appear unthankful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also realized that the wrath, the returning troops hit in the last years of the Vietnam War, was far worse.
As a result, talks about pity in breastfeeding and privates between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the marines, the Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with an awe as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "wrathful, violent veteran was hiding under the surface", said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over an elevated state post in Washington after his return.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the respondents asked subtly whether he could stand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"If you speak about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained his sons.
The lack of easyness of the military is partly rooted in the missing interest of Americans in war.
Services on the battlefield are rarely taken out by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as a commendation.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely common in World War II," said Leutnant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public concentrates largely on the suffering of a service member.
Trups find recognition for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or for the seriousness of their injuries.
Military is facing the growing pressure to harshly interfere with rape
This week an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of non-invasion in the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
Highly liberated Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who had a 12th pack of beer with her.
He asked her if he would accompany her on a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texan woman wiped her concerns apart.
I thought, "Ah, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard of my abdomen."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, claiming she.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military staff are anxiously waiting for a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which decides whether a complaint which they have filed against the former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is granted before court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not been against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., submitted, the complaint included 17 complaints, but in the following months rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to determine, condemn, or to provide appropriate jurisdiction following the supposed attacks.
Burke says that they are following the supreme military leadership, as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in position to eradicate the culture of retribution of the? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 survivors, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all applicants as it were to put their eggs into a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many further complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defense, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has requested a request to reject the application.
The records of the Court of Justice, which are present in Newsweek, are detailed in the strategy of defence, primarily that the military cannot be accused by current or former soldiers for infringements that have come into the armed forces.
Due to a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries that are added to active soldiers.
"The suspected damage occurred during the military service of the applicants," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in battle.
It's time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in their battle: three other complaints besides them are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four main military academies for the supposed promotion of a woman's enemy atmosphere.
Of this independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder", which received rape victims to release them from the service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veteran administration (i.e., management of the war veterans), in which she rejected their discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were submitted to the Congress independently of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which offer a number of points of guidance.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (Dt.: Office for Prevention and Reporting Sexual Misuse) of the Ministry of Defense, 3.158 sexual abuses were displayed.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the own estimate of the Pentagon, this figure takes about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases covered in the military came before the court, only half as many as in civil law.
The applicants in Burkes case describe their attacks as the first one of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the suspected rape of the military police less than one hour after the attack.
This night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of police, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set, and the blood of her attacker, from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing she was asked for the sex she had before her friend was attacked.
Six persons expressed their personality in the name of the suspected offender who was finally released.
"I remember the day when the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the woes were going to take. I ran out of the courtroom. "
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, that wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with dishonesty, so she will not receive any support.
Whether the complaint that Lyman and the other applicants have filed is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a ruling is this doctrine, which is criticized since she was questioned for the first time.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine in time.
The military shines after a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same horror that brings a liability.
He adds, "The chances are against them, but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the lawyer of the applicant, will begin with her hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue fighting the military in this respect until reforms come about," she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration idea online.
On Monday, Breivik, who stood to have committed his first public hearing before the court at an Amoklauf in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time before his computer attack and talked with some of the millions of nationalists who support legal extreme groups on sides of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only need to log in to Facebook.
"We have found that it wasn't difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the UK idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that the researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the page to precisely define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as it is for many years that marketers do.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then looked at them with adds, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds users invited to a survey in which, according to their educational status, their attitude toward violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once.
"It's a quite new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprising. Online promoters legal extreme groups are usually young, male and anger about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion, "those who combine their online activism with a offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and politicians use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as in "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add three content per day on average, Facebook's "Data supernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's beautifulness is the fact that you can study through this site people that you usually do not reach with your Clipboard on the street.
"When you tried to ask people of the British National Party before, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have given them access," says Bartlett.
"With Facebook, all of this falls away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to recognize and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their full noise on Facebook are significantly more inclined to drink problems than students who are silent on this subject.
Moreno suggests that similar students, e.g. residential advisers, monitor the page and help a student when posting too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you don't recognize it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children who wouldn't have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly collects the data of his own population.
The data team of the page has created statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's day, election participation in the 2010 elections and a national luck index (which primarily used information that only Facebook has access - Masters of Digital Freedom have long been aware that the site should make its large data base accessible to others for research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the page observes them whether they want to or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you will allow the site to share your personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey that they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines, how they collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, on a study from 2006 in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a Clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out to the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to take care of the social person - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Kold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood two amocourse in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military deputy in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Temple Rider of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, since you have received your mandate from organizations that support Hassideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't know myself guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, since he didn't want to give "Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a prescribed speech, the permission to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the Police Breivik for another 12 weeks should remain in investigation, that he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will monitor all the visits and all the correspondence in eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in their eyes, others wanted to confirm that he stayed behind castle and ribs.
All participated with the goal that everything would go out on a way.
"I thought he works cold and inhuman," told a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian sender NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it's going on a piece after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked quietly and professionally during the whole hearing. He looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally sick and said that there was no evidence that he had had complicated.
Some may like the attacks of 22 July seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the victim of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons from the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs that was shown this week in a theater
After Steve Jobs died on October 5th, some compared him with Henry Ford and highlighted the technique genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most in the recently rediscovered job interview, which this week before special film performances were deployed in the important markets is how much this creative head has understood business processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and himself appointed hippie, but he was also an acribic organizer who was actively basking on diagrams - a man who believed that many managing directors suffer from "a sickness of thinking", "that a truly great idea is 90 percent of work... [but there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Expert Idiots" about the upturn of the staff computer. And he was more than an hour with jobs in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, as 10 years had passed since Jobs had been forced out of Apple. And he had already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in professional idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing in the delivery.
Only after Job's death a complete VHS copy was discovered in the garage of the director.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatres this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known for abhorring extensive interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly enthusiastic in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of meditation, where jobs clearly consider his thoughts and efforts for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' Perfectionism is manifest when he seems to be unpatient to Cringely's questions and pushes him to focus more quickly on topics or by-treatments of greater importance.
Prior to the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview appears somehow inconceivable when job assessments, which other companies make his opinion right or wrong and represents their own vision on the future of the computer.
It is a matter to read posthumous dignities of career jobs'. But to see jobs here as the greedy dreamer who is on the jump to grand kindness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he had done all of this here, he left and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"With all the years in business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?". And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's made easy."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing. No one in business really thinks about things.
I found that.
Jobs continues his efforts to rationalize the accounting at Apple.
Surprisingly, how costs were recorded - mostly one started with "standard costs" that were limited to mere presumption and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined up to the smallest.
How the Pope became specialbert:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that was able to embark into the phone company and lead remote conversations for nothing.
A lot was written about the device, but jobs's enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment, is infectious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a payable phone, calling a call and then connecting from an AT&T network to another, while passing as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe, and when you crushed into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," says Jobs kichernend.
"We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves something that can control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike, the Wozniak and he nearly pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were able to imitate Henry Kissinger as well.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technology (and unprepared called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 when he searched for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at age and it formed my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever produced".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up with HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovations:
Jobs talk several times in the interview about how to invent new products spontaneously.
Early in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about both the composition and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember decisive arguments... they screamed me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse we could have built for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies leaving:
Long before he resurrected Apple, Jobs predicted the ways in which so many industrial giants, with their visions, came into tholstery and lost control of their shares.
"Say we, you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copyer or printer, na and?"
They have the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are forced out of decision-making.
The product genius, which has led to this monopoly position, will be eradicated by the people who do not have a concept of good products vs. bad products - crafts art.
This happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times larger, the Microsoft could have been in the 1990s...
You caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"It's a lot of crafts art between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, change it and grow."
You learn a lot about his fines.
You have to make voting, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You need to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it goes on to taste, it goes on to try to deal with the best stuff that people have created and then try to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists clue.
We're always shy in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people working there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who are randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are dining with opponents of health laws, as court accepts case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically dividing question whether to hear a fight against the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in a dinner sponsored by the firm that the case was represented before court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to consult the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be addressed was a complaint raised by 26 states against the wide-ranging reform of the healthcare sector, which last year was decided by the Congress, a law that became a slogan for the conservative activists everywhere in the USA.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basis discussion is expected in March, which is likely to trigger the 2012 presidency struggle, which will be in full progress at the time the judgment is announced.
The attorney who is standing before the court and will claim that the law is to be chewed will probably be Paul Clement, once a state attorney under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen companies who supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an old-in-ecess group dedicated to defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsors dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which fights the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical gigant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted the case, in a Washington hotel.
Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and an declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been visiting events of the federalist society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
Indeed, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge can participate in benefits events of law close to and other organisations, where the judge cannot be a spokesman, honorary guest or, according to the program, not a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas extended to two of the firms related to the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in this to alarm moral and government activists.
"This astonishing breakthrough with morality and the contrast with the codes punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court observes the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the USA.
"The judges won and dine during a beneficiary event with lawyers with floating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support for a donation action for this event undermine any claim on impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would mix judicial matters too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And the Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a prosecutor-general under the Obama Government when the first lawsuits came before the court in the first instance.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case for a preliminary ruling because it was too committed to the defense of the law to be unprivileged.
Kagan doesn't do this to do.
Boeing draws record order of 18 billion dollars on land
Airline Emirates order 50 two-way aircraft of type Boeing 777 with an option to 20 other aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than 1 billion dollars.
It is really a rare message that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big business when the company is Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 planes is at a record sum of 18 trillion dollars.
The client of Boeing is also unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need 2.520 aircraft worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest commission for commercial aircraft on the weekend, measured at the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer order came from the Emirates Airline from Dubai.
In 2011, Boeing announced it at the Dubai Aviation Show, the airline also has an option to buy 20 other aircraft, which makes the entire list price rise to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, who enormously improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these planes is more than 1 billion dollars.
"That's absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar stock exchanger.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil producering countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the planes, but rather an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful, as the country deserves at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or move airline orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"You have a natural assurance," he said.
The order of Emirates reaffirms Boeing’s leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitors SAS in chess who attack the prerogative with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that one would move the introduction of the largest A350 that competes directly with the 777-300ER.
One moved the introduction to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher load and range.
The Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President Lost Apparently Choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer opponent Fausto Vallejo supported the PRI in the race around the governor posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. On Monday she claimed that drug dealers had influenced the race for one of their opponents.
Following the provisional results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for the Governor's posts in the Western State by the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire election process and especially on yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"You threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys ... you have occupied election cabins, built street blockades ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just hit Claderon, which had taken place in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the currently-official governor, came to place three, a severe defeat for the split and unhappy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links with drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
For a long time, Michoacan was dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and ampheamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a militaryly led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence is still on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates rose from the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the race around the President's Office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think this victory will make us look courageously next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro area in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will reduce Asia's economy's growth.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations in the world have to do "all things in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Phone or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who look at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So everyone who can help Europe from this crisis," he said the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all the means."
Europe's Monetary Union has suffered a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days Italy's interest rates have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers have resigned from Italy as well as Greece.
The upcoming serious debt crisis in Europe is scared that the global economy could fall into the recession and led to calls for the leading emerging countries to join together in order to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds of the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiation power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro area, as the economy now suffers from the falling exports and the drying of foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the euro area to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's no option, it's an assignment, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have an impetus to help the rich Europeans if they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the American Brown University, said that it would be very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India to help Europe, of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or less per day.
"Whenever, they will find out that the Greeks retired with 50 and spend holidays on the beach, and then they have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service, managed in poor jobs, losses imposed such as rail.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" on all Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/Throws now "the risk of classification" due to the threatening danger from Europe.
He said that vulnerable threshold markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their wordships.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuttings in the defense system
Defense Minister Leon Panetta heated the convention on Monday when he warned that automatic budget reductions would weaken national security unnoticed. So he triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civil flow bands.
The Pentagon already reflects reductions of 450 billion dollars during the coming decade, but now fears that further reductions will be needed by $600 billion or more if the Congress cannot conclude the expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the Ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress in the purpose of a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation, would lead to 23% general reductions and a stop of numerous new projects.
"A high reduction, carried out in such unthinked way, would make most of our ship and construction projects inadequate - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to dismiss ourselves from a large majority of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to allow civilians with a certain probability to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously harm our alarming will."
The cuts were finally hit the fighting troops," said Panetta.
"While the wartime quotas are not directly affected by the confiscation, the serious intervention into the basic budget would adversely affect the efforts of war," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been reduced, which would lead to delays in the settings and the controls that support the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be reduced, which leads to late payments to war time dealers and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators replied to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of automatic reductions on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of a confiscation of the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid fall in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehement against this draconic act," said the senators in a joint declaration on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result with which we cannot live, and it is certainly nothing that we should be forced."
"The confiscation is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be permitted."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to withdraw the Pentagon of cuts remains waiting.
Panetta has increasingly pronounced the possible reductions, although he was able to collect many years of experience with the budget in the Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he is facing severe decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a dark picture of what could come about - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an airwear without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a papery, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morality and alarming and which is unable to take it up with potential opponents."
"She actually makes a person angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta presented new details, such as reductions "creating significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our worldwide ability to use and enter into force, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the greatest defense projects in the removal could be victims, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list includes F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombing aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new littoral Combat Ship and the new ground-fighting vehicle that Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If you would stop the further development and the F35 tests, this would save up to 80 billion dollars in the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step to reconstruction so that possible dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Discharge a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lie are in everyday life.
The President-in-Office of the Republican Republicans, Herman Cain, is involved in becoming master of the accusations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides claim each other of the lie.
Penn State's leadership is accused of myid, as one claims to have retained reports that a retired football trainer has sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to the U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a lie.
lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
The New York Congress Deputy and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself foolish when he circulated denunciations that were very quickly refused by indispensable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the infringement in the campaign financing related to the confusion of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied to Monica Lewinsky during his second term of office in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about scums in school and college tests are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the examination answers so that they could do well even in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and shuffling are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times each day.
Many of these lies, however, are considered to be an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "discovering learning" is one that is important for every person, both for personal and for professional reasons.
Far away from a game of society such as sharates, where it is the goal of calling "Have you!", deceiving a deception is a serious knowledge area based on scientific data collected at renowned universities that have carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of research is that most old myths have been discarded about the lie.
lying looks in your eyes.
They don't always stumbling, stamping, rescuing, and whipping.
However, it should not be concluded that these liars are hard to uncover and discard.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning about the structure of the allegation, the fine face expressions, questionnaires and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and steady growing area of detarnation, and it is clear that decaying is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in the rightfulness of our complex world, especially if the setting or questioning of people or negotiations or administration are one of their own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good in evaluating other people who are interested in their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people that men often optical "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that when a person is discouraged as a wrongdoer, others feel less guilty of lying to this person.
How do you know if someone lies?
First, by observing the normal behaviour of this person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It presents a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their trial staff.
You should know better when someone usually triples with the foot, so that they do not wrongly accuse him when he triples with the foot during a meeting.
Then take care of accumulation of noticeable verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of detonation.
People who deceive, may be paralyzed when they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxing after the conversation of attitude", this deep, relaxing breath and the change in the attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questioning often mistakenly signals that a recruitment conversation is over, just to look out after this relaxation conversation.
Also take care of the language of your trial staff.
Scott Peterson's excursionist is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Foolish people can also use a different language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or when you repeat a clever question in total.
The most common verbal signs are subtil.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a clever question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I am known ... according to best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than secrecy, which often shrinks the alarm bells.
There is no magic agent for decaying lies, but you can learn abilities, thanks to which detaration is possible.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can become more rarely victims of fraudulents, both in the private and in the professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after risk by delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, which annoyed the trade unions and at the same time reassured environmental protectors, the pipeline-building companies are striving to re-plan the project to return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the sandhills will be transformed into Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline is finally approved, though with another course.
This was done after an announcement by the Foreign Ministry last week, after which a decision on a federal authorization for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, which would avoid the area of the sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered, may postpone a decision by 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama explained last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to support it.
The 1700 Miles Pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 Barrel oil per day from Alberta Province to the refinery in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmental protectors hate them, but labour markets they love because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a return from the region of the sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy states that the Department's main auditor has requested a separate probe of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was appointed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was consultant of Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether one company that was commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, as it is connected with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused, as she said she forced a little child out of fear to break
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had suffered a tobish attack that would have frightened her little daughter so much that she gave herself to fear.
The tyrade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disturbance" and "more fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10, last year, when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, wanted to break up a kindergarten and Genevieve for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went to the lobby with the baggage and Genevieve on the arm in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and put her daughter down for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle exhorted the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and started to shun - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to chop water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you've done with my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle crashed on the mother, who still wore Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back from her companion and moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby shouted so much that it had to pass, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls in which an opinion was requested.
The complaint is on a non-specific compensation, but the attorney of the family, Sam Davis, said that he would not charge a honorary and plan the family, donate the money she gets to child cancer.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is displayed to a child's gardener who wears a 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate oppositions inhibited the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, unemployment and black work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment fell and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, Sinaloas will be remembered in the economic history. It is the first year Mario López Valdez, who is calling himself the initiator of transformation and has created great hopes for economic growth. However, as a result of the climate-wide oppositions, growth cannot be mentioned, but, on the contrary, the most important economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in millions in agriculture, but also limited the growth of the state economy and resulted in a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year, mainly in the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which has been inevitably affected by further economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582 000 hectares of agricultural lands used were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity by November has constantly increased unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituteo Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, since from January to March 55 053 inhabitants had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the labour force. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is due to several factors. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that the public institutions' policy indirect explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses on the market due to the medium reductions by the legislation adopted to combat money laundering at the Congress, because for those who collect dollars forbidden it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use something else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined, on the one hand due to the problems of entry and on the other, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Blackwork
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, taking into account the high proportion of blackwork, which, according to INEGI, covers 60.38 percent of those working in the country without paying into the social insurance cash.
Unemployment and black work are the lowest wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituteo Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretariat del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Regulationsbehörde für Arbeit und soziale Fürsorge in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was by September 5352 pesos, which is much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Decline of the ADI
In addition to decreasing economic activity and growing unemployment, in 2011 the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the past ten years is recorded. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI was $630 597 from January to June, which corresponds to a sweat of 87.74 percent compared to the $5143 312 in the same period of the previous year.
Sectaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Regulation for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, most of which comes from companies from the tertiary sector.
Debts
In view of the economic crisis, the national government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos in July to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities. The National Congress approved a amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive impact of debt on any of the country's industries could be identified by November.
Reactions
For the entrepreneurship representatives, the first year of Mario López Valdé’s incapability of government made it clear.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico), stated that in 2011 no effort was made to harmonize the views of the different sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really in need of work this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the terrain lost this year and we have to double effort in 2012. The efforts of all, and in particular, the progress of the already well agreed government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated together," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events, as frost at the beginning of the year, made the country’s economic development difficult and slower.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the main effects is a slowed economy that is not enough in motion to create an economic dynamic which could create an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore we will finish the year far below our expectations," he said.
Re-defining vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (entrepreneurship association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, stated that the state had to be more dynamic.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to re-determine the economic profession and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There is a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that guides government efforts in better ways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which one can say that the government has acted more extensively. What I can say is that has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Detention for 8 kg Marihuana
To five years in prison and 100 days, a resident of Navolato was sentenced for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic’s prosecutor announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a criminal offence against public health - here the ownership of marijuana.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military in the surveillance of the road Cipriano Valdez opposite the guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug retailer drove in a white delivery car, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were transferred to the Judge of the District and the penalty officer is still in the executive institution.
Debts for construction work
The social buildings provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos programmes and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed because of lack of resources or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Head of the Urban Social Development Authority said that although the construction programmes have already been advanced, they are now in danger, as the government has not paid the funds it has allocated for the three programmes exceeding 11 million peso.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to nearly 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now only the Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction end would be expected.
"12 million have to contribute, and although the year is already over, they haven't given us a penny, and that even though they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "In order not to be late, we have already started construction work, and they have been far advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not fulfilled its obligations, so at the beginning of its government time the municipality had to acquire a loan of 7 million. This corresponds to the amount that the central government had to pay.
"This has already been so for us in the last legislature because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the State had not spent to participate in these programmes," he executed.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance was requested to accelerate administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as quickly as possible.
"At about 12 million, they have to contribute, and although the year is already over, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court approves the transition to the digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints lodged by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Bureau’s Decree and, in effect, the transfer of analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required for the fight against law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the Decree of Law with details on the transition to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, since it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-Constitutionality.
The project for the complaint drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero suggested that the Decree of Law should be declared inadmissible, as the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the regulations relating to radio and television, and therefore the Decree of Law would contradict the hierarchical principles and the law reserved.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies submitted constitutional complaints against the Decree of Law. Following the adoption of the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree of Law and introduced all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister said that he should not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the national government cannot regulate the measures to be taken by public administration by general rules.
"I also do not believe that if this was done, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected."It also reminded that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it is the leader of state affairs.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it improves the use of radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitization, which is a decision in public interest that does not only have technical aspects, "because they cover economic, social, political and security aspects."
These issues, she stressed, "required the action of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State they included a group of features that lay the Constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out digital conversion, although they had highly specialized institutions.
It could not be concluded that the government would enter into the competences of the Congress with the release of the contested Decree of Law, because the laws adopted by the Legislative would comply," she assured.
The possibility to count the votes in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place in the election of the governor is nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes from a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of the single counting of the vote records this year is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor elections is nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes from a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that just last 9 November, the election body had adopted a number of rules for harmonising local regulations with the reforms of the state in electoral affairs.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his election law nor his law on election justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force at this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Advisory Board within the time limits for that purpose with the argument or objections to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint lodged by the local legislature and judged the prosecutor's vote on constitutional reforms as "invaluable and illegal", since it does not have the right to "determine or impose a veto on it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview on the possibility of a single countdown of the votes that thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM, the local electoral authority would now be able to count the vote records partially or completely.
The results of the protocols cannot be partially counted under the following conditions: the protocol on the counting and calculation of votes is not available or there is no possession of the Chairman of the Committee of Elections or there are obvious mistakes or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, the total counting of the entirely filled election documents may be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one standing at second place, equal or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting an explicit request is made by the party-or-severe coalition chairman, which is the second of those candidates.
The counting of votes may also take place in its entirety, if, after the conclusion of the proper calculation, it is found that the difference between the suspected winner and the candidate is equal or less than one percent at the second place, provided that an explicit application is provided by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the choice packages exposed to a partial countdown would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is nearly 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of a total of 923 election protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The rests of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés rose to Saltillo, its birth place this Sunday evening. On Monday the show of the dead and a Mass took place.
According to family members, the last will of the supervisor was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains.
After one honor, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila, along with the others who died at the accident, in one plane of the Mexican Air Force. The most closest people took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At 12 a.m., the ashes of the Oberstleutnant landed at the Trauerhalle, located at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 5:30 a.m., his remains were investigated at the technological Institute of Saltillo. This body view was caused by his former fellow students from the technical abitur and his American football team, felipe Bacio, during his preparation for the abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ash would spread over the Zapalinamé mountain, which he had always said to his family and his friends this way," announced Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the superintendent had fulfilled all his dreams and she thinks he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of Zapopán Air Force, Jalisco.
Some could not get it because they thought it would even dizzy him on a truck. Nevertheless, he always tried to realize his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even at the age of seven, he had graduated to Zapopán for his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked: a plane flying.
A last abbreviation
The executive of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was approved with all honour under the leadership of the Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honor gave him the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, School Director and pupils of Saltillo's Technology Education Institute, where he studied in 1985, and as excellent in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter flying by him, in which he was also the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority, crashed.
At 18.05 a.m., the innate remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the barracks of the burial company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez. There, his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Cristina, his mother, siblings and other family members, students and teachers, were already expecting him.
The left bodies were found on a plot at the Cadereyta NL
Some hours before the discovery, military members presented 11 people to the media who had been arrested in the same place in connection with the organised crime.
Three men were found by shots in different parts of the body and a grace shot in a abandoned finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at the point 1.5 of the land road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several predecessors saw that the door of the landhouse surrounded by a beige-brown wall was rising in a slight way.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons within about three meters, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another one clothed with a white top.
The body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants was nearly one metre away.
All three lay on the abdomen.
According to the information received on site, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, as no cartridges were found.
At the wall of the country house there are inscriptions that write one organized criminal band to another, and several interventions were found in wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretariat de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) presented 11 persons, including a minor who were part of a criminal walk mainly in the town of Cadereyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murder, halemo (people hunting) and secret burials.
After the information made public, eight persons were first arrested in Los Alveros on November 11th and freed a prisoner.
Three properties and a mobile phone were ensured. The arrested confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12 at 6:00 a.m. on their watch round in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta, the military found a car without number signs with two inmates.
At the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charging device and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2:00 a.m., one of their complicators was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape when the military was seen.
They are charged secretly in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday's education of the new Italian government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the President of Italy to present to this the new government which is supposed to present the crisis that has led Italy to the margin of economic collapse.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the President of Italy to present to this the new government which is supposed to present the crisis that has led Italy to the margin of economic collapse.
A communication from the presidency palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President-in-Office of State, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm governmental education.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed by a majority of technocrates, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take up his office.
Monti said that he would present to the President the results of the discussions with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to deal with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not expressly confirm governmental education, but his comments indicate that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well cut", he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. At the same time, Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt into an incomparable amount.
The new government, led by the former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard saving package, which was required by the euro politicians to regain the confidence in Italy.
The pressure on the hurry on Monti was still intensified by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which Italian government bonds were taxed with 7 percent interest for 10 years. This corresponds to the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industrial Association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government after all."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
Montis's chances of success were significantly increased by support from Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign as a result of the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the middle-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential because many of its members have so far expressed themselves against a majority of technocrat government which is currently forming Monti.
Parliament's support
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular savings measures.
Resistance against its efforts or delaying the reforms could again cause a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Federation of Foreign Banks exercises pressure with its indication that a failure is Montis a catastrophe.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurships as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The session will be completed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, launched an extremely rapid change of government.
After short breathing at the end of the last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the costs for Italian government bonds have again reached critical limits.
Rescue Italy with a government debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government must take up to the next elections that are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of prefering the elections.
Monti said that he would like to take politicians into his cabinet, but the large parties insist that this should consist of only technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties make the involvement of political people complicated.
Spanier have more games than the Ticos
From the 22 players called from Spain have ten over 50 international games on the bucket.
From Costa Rica's pages, only one of the 22 populated 50 games has left.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendship game that takes place today at 15.05 p.m. in the San José National Stadium.
While the World and Europe champion, the number one on the FIFA monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of class A selection games, the three-coloured team has only the defensive player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number on last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players playing in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup Championships) as well as high-level European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie comes with complicated excretion games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters within the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA rankings very below.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached 126 foreign games with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on Saturday against England (London Neighborhood 0-1).
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from the UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian team, who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted adbizarreta with 126 and the middle storm of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Follow him Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, the left side storm Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five came up over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Those with the least games.
Less than 30 games are held in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From sides of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20s border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only recorded one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
The historic gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot most gates with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintett moved Costa Rica into his tour to celebrate his twenty-year-old existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that realizes"
In the exclusive discussion with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts in the next Sunday stadium.
Over 20 years they were expected, but the band assured that when they play in Costa Rica, they realize a dream for them.
This assured the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from Brazil last week from an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they will join the National Stadium in the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica from 19.30 p.m.
You read an excerpt from the conversation whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your costaric fans, a dream is realized when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been to the holiday in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we'll probably stay there for a few days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are totally devoted. They experience the most intensive days before the concert.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We took nearly 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting for so long and we're sorry to have needed so long as we've come here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the largest show of the year.
Doesn't that take a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have performed over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we like to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and are enthusiastic about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends always went to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour, you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we do not set any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that is partly because we have nine records and can play more than 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so that the decision we will play will not be easy.
If we take two or three songs, which we haven't played any longer, we can maintain our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, is it hard to believe in your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all, I believe that no one of us imagined to play in a great rock band once, and that for more than 20 years. That seems like a dream.
We continue to put on this blessing and find it great to be able to play music together even now.
We like and are enthusiastic about producing music.
We're lucky to go to the places of the world that we've always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have participated actively in the anniversary of the grave?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement comes from a group of friends.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound gardens on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with them and it honors us to be part of this coming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) hit us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive, and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friend, so we have opened up musical paths that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't go better.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to fall this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you remember that the people have come because of the music, this reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what she has created, without being a famous rock star. That never happened to us.
What memories do you have of your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never published a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have used so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built up the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I remember what was an incredible man Andy and how he made me laugh. It was always a joy to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their works, especially Eddie Vedder, and the band has chosen for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This is certainly exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He's singing him, and I think he's singing the first thing that happens to him.
Who were you influenced as a bassist?
From so many+
One of the first ones that strike me is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists who like me.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the greeting alive, although it's no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find it great because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now it's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could work slightly ready. But there are also other songs such as The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, even though they have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to both when I heard Ed's play, and they're very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - e.g. if you lose a family member or a friend - that influences your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embodie it for me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical studies
The former president Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who has 25 years of imprisonment for infringements of human rights during its government period (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which operates and is under control for four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congress member and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would investigate the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members for three days at the Peruvian hospital Institute Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas.
Aguinaga commented that he believed Fujimori could be graced for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish this because he considered him innocent.
He was operated four times in tongue cancer and lost 18 kilograms of weight. Further diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and blood bleeding problems in his legs, the doctor counted on.
Fujimori is located in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía prisoner since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruan army, who was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official decree led by the Uruguay President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to extend trade between the two countries and discuss political topics of the region
Mujica meets the next Wednesday with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón, which, according to the Uruguay President, will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguay people living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," announced the President of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica sought support from Calderón for the incident with France, when the French government leader Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax paradise at the summit of the G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still appear as a tax paradise from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and industrial countries in the world since November. Since January this year there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information for the prevention of double implications with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has attempted to accelerate the drafting of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to remove from the "great list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries which have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been held at business level since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The snorry installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought hardly for the salvation of Princess Peach for 25 years from the clauses of the evil bowser, but never until now in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he struggles for the love of the girl in Stereo technology.
The game that comes this month on the store covers of the world has been cut from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Nintende 3DS, which can be played without a special glass three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain in the presentation of the Madrid video game.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo, which has been developed from the beginning for this console" because up to now, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adaptations of existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo underlined that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "proviable" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to catch the less choked users.
After that, the experts can turn a second round over the different legs of the game, which are becoming more and more difficult.
In real time users can also choose between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects", it must always be played three-dimensional.
This trip of Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means returning the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twinks to the fans of Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The snorpy installer has to overcome platforms that have been spoiled with dangers in order to liberate Princess Peach.
However, the player strikes news in the movements, the environment, the clothing and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom bores for delivery of Portillos to the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would take place the delivery of the former governor Alfonso Portillo so that it would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy of US $70 million money laundering.
Thus, the process on the US's request for delivery of Portillo ends so that it can be brought before court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision on the independence of judicial authority and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He stressed that during his government, he had not interfered with jurisdiction decisions and had given up all requests for delivery of which he was notified.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and severe body injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both because of drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted for the condemnation of the former President of the Council (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemala Constitutional Court, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation is clarified in Guatemala and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the submission of 120 million Quetzals in the Ministry of Defense during his government period. This trial was preceded by the delivery, but the Minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was launched to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove Social Assistance Organization have led to important results: 6000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported in this quarter century to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, attended by more than 300 people, was taken into account.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At the yesterday celebration in Sant Andreu, many responsible representatives of institutions and institutions who worked with the association in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions at election times demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently the left-green city council of Ricard Goma.
The Grand Hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example to fight against difficult circumstances and to give people hope in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he does," he said.
occupied house where giant parties were organized was cleared
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes Nr. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve house occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without being opposed.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 have found an end on the road Balmes.
Twelve people volunteered to leave the building, which they kept illegally occupied and organized in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The remembrance took place on judicial arrangement without any police intervention.
After the respiratory, the door lock was replaced in order to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, the access will be controlled," confirmed the house administrator.
The house occupants who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. They also painted the walls and left all kinds of waste, especially doses with alcoholic beverages.
The three lower floors celebrated huge parties that lasted for up to two days and driven tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also damaged it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat said Europe Press that her business had declined by 80% since the beginning of the household occupation.
The owner of the Discothek pointed out that the house occupants made her unfair competition, for they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the Discothek.
In addition, the owner of the recreational area had been indicated by the neighbors because of rest disturbance, while according to her statement the noise did not touch the visitors of the disco, but by the house owners, and in particular by the guests of the festivals organized there, and, according to the statements of the angry neighbors in the last weeks, they became more and more and more.
The discothek's responsible said that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - Volkspartei) at the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week to clear the building immediately and to cope with the problems of bourgeois life and the descent of the city district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that the house occupants had been in the last months in all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some, it had even come to thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to penalty and to intervene against the asocial acts in the building."
Another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared yesterday by the Catalunic police.
At 15.30 p.m., the police approached the road Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people wishing to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the tender, apart from the disputes about the Honorars.
The city procurement over the 16 gates opens the debate on the significance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 1980s, at the highlight of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its reproach writing on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again the ceiling of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few that are not spread in north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park plays with this idea.
Now it was no longer the Central Park but Yellowstone with wild swine in the role of the yogi bear.
As far as the city was issued in September a huge invitation to tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or someone is planning to put gates on land.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organizational point of view but also from a reflection over the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is already almost a recent topic on which two members of this old-occupied box, who meet in the elevator, can react.
And exactly this fact offers the substance for one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have claimed to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "is it necessary" to talk about the "Front on the Mountain" after the attack on the coast, as long as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out on the green apples.
"You should assume the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because he is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," the architect judges, for which the title "Tore of Collserola" brings a "lexical trap": It must not be imagined as "access to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which it has to be handled."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, views the proposal as a "intellectual challenge", which creates "some dangers".
Risks due to the "uncertainty that brings about the design of a public space today" following the experiences of the 1980s that had their "swung" in the field of the Forum.
The first fear is its own limitation to what can be built.
"To limit something always means to define the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [incorporated in the General Metropolitano Plan (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who sticks closer to the question, says simplifying the side of Collserola, who goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not in the direction of Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola, which should not be "focused on pigeon ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of the guidance letter that enables the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "twins" to whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("the right one," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as in the terms of tendering, a global view of Collserola is missing: "There were 16 competitions written in the cross-section," he says, "on the axis mountain lake. But there are no longitudinal perspectives that view the area in its entirety."
At least in his case, this has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his view, the city should necessarily guarantee that the stripes are fitted directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between city and green zones.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the author of the Casino Red liberated the mayor of Monterrey's brother from the process that is led against him because of presumptuous oppression.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the author of the Casino Red has given him before the second tribunal of the district, which leads the trial against the mayor's brother of Monterrey for repression.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás can be seen, which supposedly forces him to pay a sum of money, so that the city administration permits the secret operation of the Wetthaus.
After the penalty notice, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panist mayor, which was arrested for 30 days on September 2nd.
After four hours with the official of Minister Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained at this place 49 days after a second warrant after the official of the Minister Público had rejected the offences of bribery and organised crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison, because he had probably conquered the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he stayed only a few hours in the Middle Security Train, as murder threats were present against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as a prisoner of the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, the secretary of the Second Tribunal of the District, Jorge Yánez, was appointed to him a detention decree, which found that, following the almost two months of investigations, sufficient evidence was provided to Jonás to speak guilty of the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bethouse to open it in return.
On this Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to adopt the penalty, so he will be put on free foot in the next hours.
During the hearing of the court, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Minister Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had corrected the damage and who the owner of the bet house had expressed his forgiveness. However, the attorney held the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is spoken freely and no claims can be lodged against the process and no compensation is required.
After the hearing of the representative of the Wedding House at 15.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free foot.
The Secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, drove to the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been freed and that his case would be put to the records.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the aircraft accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results on the accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people died, pointed out that the helicopter was directly attacked against the ground with its entire unearthed structure without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communication and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees in 25 meters height, while the helicopter lost the rump, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several soil contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 prisoners, so he met all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found in the field of the investigations on which the machine had dropped.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found in other places, the cover covering the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he met all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area has a cutting of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is priority to get the investigation results as soon as possible, but these may take several months, perhaps even one year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for aviation and auxiliary services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of Estado Mayor Presidencial had flew with a speed of travel and that the plane had fallen to a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the collapse."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, had six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Speed of visibility:
In line with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visibility flight. This means that the team had to have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, some deeply hanging clouds were raised.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley due to the clouds.
Attention point:
The collapse coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Perhaps there has not been a loss of control over the plane or a deviation from the flight route before the collapse.
Dispersion of the remains of the plane in a limited area:
The information available up to this date indicates that the helicopter was pushed up from straight and sided direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft residues suggest that the helicopter had collapsed on the ground with its unearthed structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane offer neither fire nor explosion in the accident site.
The last investigation results indicate several soil contacts.
In the local investigations, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is shaky and has a shaft of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably went to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several soil contacts.
After a minor search in an area that went beyond the locked area in the accident site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which strengthened the assumption that the unearthed aircraft structure had been collapsed against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
It conducts a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and young people supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituteo Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents entitled "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers in connection with overweight are to be found.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica, at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nursing careers, nutrition specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports places of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are performed every Saturday at 8 p.m.
He stressed that the investigation at the Sportplatz of Cuauhtémoc (West of the state of México) began and was continued on the sports square of Nezahualcóyolt (east of the state of México).
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will continue at the sports square of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study is to identify factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and identify risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the worldwide day of diabetes, he stated that three thousand children and adolescents at the age of six to 14 should fill with the consent and under the supervision of their parents on nutritional issues.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease in order to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or renal failure.
He further concluded that on the following Saturdays, the subjects were measured (weight, size, size), their blood pressure control, and blood levels such as glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (require the identification of genes related to childhood fatty).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of the healthcare professional about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in nearly six years, the proportion of fatty boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity increased by 47 percent. Overweight also increased dramatically," the IMSS specialist stressed.
He said that the search for genetic marks was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from the other peoples.
He indicated that an average Mexican (e) was 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African origin, reflecting in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity were incapable of burning the surplus of energy (calorie) to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the investigators was in a comprehensive study of the children, in which it would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folding in the neck and in the interior arm (acanthosis), which indicates the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stadium.
All information would be treated confidentially and informed by the doctors in writing. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and propose to them changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there would be three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day before television and using means of transport instead of short walks.
The high calories, i.e. increased consumption of sugar and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with high fat and protein intake and genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents stroke holes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico, UNAM developed asphalts modified with polymers to make the mix more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If it were not necessary to repair nearly 200 000 stroke holes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city of the valley of Mexico) erupted, Rafael Herrera Najera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the interpretation and maintenance of the asphalt bearing are adequately seen, the number of stroke holes will be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Bagholes from a technical point of view", which he held on chemistry at the International Year, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, which, however, has a greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Najera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the northern part of the country, to improve the behaviour of the street cover and thus avoid the occurrence of stroke holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the most serious part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, of which part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together they give to the street cover its characteristic teethic behaviour.
The weighty behaviour of the asphalt means that at high temperatures of nearly 180°C it is like a liquid, at 120°C it is very tough and nearly fixed at 50°C, while it becomes brew at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but changes on a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer reported.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible street cover consisting of six material layers, of which the last three asphalts were included.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt that consists of small, in asphalt fried and then fixed stones.
Each single stone of this wear layer, had been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles are moving on and producing forces, this layer enables a good distribution of power in the street cover.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he stated, "a last layer is designed, the so-called drag layer consisting of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and must produce friction.
This road cover receives and distributes most of the forces, the load layer also needs an appropriate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other, important factors to be taken into account, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the site is wet, water penetrates into the layer and is only difficult to escape. This causes an eradication of all layers of the street cover and consequently the appearance of stroke holes.
When a stroke comes up," he said, "the deck layer is first carried down, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of stroke holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road cover must always be proportionate to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that, in order to avoid frequent stroke holes, this regime is respected.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there were still many research work, for example about asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, and with which the stroke holes were easily repaired without applying high temperatures.
What was missing Candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th miss title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca left empty when giving the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the victor's podium to show a silver crown and the band that she proves to be a new Miss Colombia.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took over the crown and the cedar, the departamento is already on 14 mistitles and Melina is gathered to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had held the crown nearly in hands. Among the proclaimed Misses include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuel Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Leila Garcés Aljure (2008).
The great question that many today ask is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the fall of a great favorite who had shown at every performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing, she was elected to the Queen of Police and to Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, who had also received the Beauty Queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor, which is decisive for the jury's decision to appoint it to the First Miss, is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "What book has influenced you the strongest and why?", which you had been put by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in the literature, I think it's a kind of civilization, ultimately I think that the book, which was the most strongest for my childhood, is 'The Little Prince', a rather deep-going book.
I am currently reading 'Schuld and Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Leidenschaften'.
An answer, which had little resentment, first because of the term 'civilize' and second, because she had not specifically explained the way in which each book she mentioned had influenced them.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony, Melina said to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little `The little prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one, who had inhabited all the incidents and who had received all the prices in advance (Gastronomy competition Oster, public agreement on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealous, which stressed the queen, which could therefore not shine on the stage."
And this was noticed in their first imagination in the bathing suit on the beach of Hilton Hotel and in their two elevators at the crowning celebration.
Although she was sure to appear with both, she lacked the strength and the swing that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned as a Miss "shows that the candidate, who wins the most prizes during the competition, will nevertheless not become a queen".
In addition, Valle left the press – a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury regarding her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty competition.
It will have his reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty, they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the body and focus on social feelings, that it had already worked on projects before participating in competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the Derriere and the Fibrose, which they noticed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, for the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutritions and responsible physical work.
The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body that it would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the abdomen, which was honestly hardly noticeable for me, pressed her score on the last day."
At the same time, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine considers that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical interventions she had underwent.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this price, which is first awarded by the National Beauty Competition, after the appearance in the bathing suit, a cruel prediction was created which was to be realized during the night. It was tampered that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price to not let them come into the enjoyment of the crown.
No matter whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina has come up with her reign year today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at the appointment of the National Beauty Competition in one of the international competitions.
However, as one of the queens who had escaped the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, she will enter the history.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscope from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4th, a Lophoscope of the National Attorney Unit (CTI) from Cali went as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary troops of Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the department of the CTI, this week Eliazar González had prepared a man from Puerto Tejada who has been cooperating in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he had to identify.
In 2000 he settled after Valle over and after the completion of the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to frictions, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big expected him.
On Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspect was that one of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the most investigated, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, for this was not the least similar to the figures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thiner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnitude, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the Chief of the FARC.
In search of tracks
For a Dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
The dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists do not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery matters and confirm the identity of arrested persons.
During their arrest, many criminals present false certificates or they have none.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to rip a piece of wall out of a house when he stole, because the thief had been backed up exactly this place with his hand when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the removal of fingerprints, but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the fingerprints, murder suspects can also be discharged or taxed.
A dead person was recently found surrounded by snapping bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be deceitful, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscopist of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reactions would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a tape is used to take.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, that's the criminal database, or to the staff office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID papers," said the CTI expert.
He said that it wasn't all the way it was presented in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is shining, it's not all that you get to is a fingerprint.
However, it can be used by making a corresponding comparison.
The "advertents" call out the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators drove together in tents on the Zucotti Square.
A large part came to follow the burial command and changed its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement asked the New York authorities this Tuesday, when they tried again to enter the Manhatten Square with a judicial order, after they had been cleared from the place in the morning gray and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators drove together in front of the Zucotti platform, on which they had a judicial arrangement which allowed the "remembers" to allow the new tents to enter this place. At the same time, another part of the movement was held at the remembrance command and occupied a park further north in the city where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place, we will find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray stated that the answer of the "reproached" to the remembrance of her tent camp, directed by Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of New York, came before the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the violence of the place and approved the tent for the demonstrators.
In addition, the "removed" occupied a new park that is located at the crossing of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour, but afterwards the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had found themselves in this place, where also a decree of religious leaders had arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zucotti-Platz (a private property site) remains closed in the expectation of a judicial hearing, which is still in place for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the pregnancy is to be analysed in the morning greys.
Some of the demonstrators carried photo copies of this judicial arrangement and distributed them. They even gave them some policemen who guarded the place, which resulted in "some small collisions", as Braray reported, who had indicated that some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial instruction forbids the authorities to clear members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and forbid the demonstrators to return to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg explains before the press that due to this judicial arrangement, the reopening of the place for public transport and demonstrators had been lifted. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish with tents and sleep bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the mural of the Zucotti Square in the morning gray, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "distated against the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order for remembrance of the place because he had transformed "to a place where people did not come to demonstration, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people," because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents feared "their quality of life".
"Bloomberg was horrible in the morning gray and shows that Bloomberg is essentially interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of the North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor of "do not respect the freedom of the press".
The responsible of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they thought about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with municipal organisations and trade unions, to remember the two months that the protests have lasted since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas Show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, it will appear on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens Assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the woman of the rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the virgin Mary in a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (Balladensänger) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will take place on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will hip a very special virgin Maria's life.
Today, CTV distributed images of the television program, in which Anderson - also for the dissemination of a self-rotted porno - appears as a virgin Mary with a doll in the gun that Jesus is supposed to represent, together with her former husband, the drum player of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee.
In the scene Peters, a well-known Canadian comicer of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderator at the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" mission of Charlie Sheen, as a child of Jesus.
The Christmas program of CTV not only sets on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentineian model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, which is not far from this controversy.
Bublé recently called the North American Kim Kardashian "Hure" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
The GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, which was still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake that broke into a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced the Second World War.
The first estimates made by the government in Tokyo evaluated the damage to $300 000, which seems to be weakening despite the difficult world economic situation.
According to three quarters of cases, the data on the gross domestic product were used to finalize this chapter from July to September: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% to the high rate of the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since January to March 2010.
The revival can be explained partially by the machine sales for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared with the decline of 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of uncontinued increases.
Nevertheless, the actual transformation of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on key-nian offences that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan is awakened, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, rising from the growing expenditure on vehicles, travels and leisure activities.
The Stigma of Yen
Tokyo has entrusted himself to the domestic market, after the Yen - the Japanese currency - fled into one of the "accession currencies" of investors, who have been experiencing the debt crisis of the eurozone and the drifting forecasts for the US, a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of exporters.
With a harder currency, products abroad are expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony returned their weak business results from July to September to the notation of the yen.
While the markets continue to besieged the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the persistent risks, for example, the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very uplifting.
The Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OECD) explained that in September most Member States had made clearer signs of slowing economic development.
The indicator that presupposes the turning points of the world economy revealed that the largest economic potential would have brake.
For he fell by four tenths to 100,4 points compared to the 100,8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average value, which is 100, after being reduced by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens makes doubts arise again
Papadimos says that the savings measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high-risk premiums of peripheral countries and widening uncertainty, Greece continues to lose in the labyrinth that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the appointed a hundred days might be too short for their implementation, the leaders of the Conservative Party of Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new savings measures and not withdraw his request for new elections at the planned date, 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday to open a parliamentary debate which will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of trust for the new government.
The first initiatives are a package of 24 employment support programmes, the reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax impairment.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not clear doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing."
The Conservative Leader took a step too far with its challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8000 million which Athens needs, and made clear that he would not approve a declaration of commitment on the fulfilment of the savings measures.
However, the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of poker game with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand should not be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties would not sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government, "what was needed for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek pinch still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "predominant" position of Spain on this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinancing".
The Queen Sofía of Spain yesterday reminded that Spain has developed the second donor for international cooperation in the last two decades worldwide. Their " Beings" are based on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind based on confidence in humans".
The Queen donated yesterday the fifth World Summit on Small Credits in Valladolid. She was convinced that it was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations until 2015 and "in particular the goal of the number of people living with income of less than one dollar per day, that is, below the "Armuts Limit".
Spain "keeps working" at the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsible," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit that lasts to Thursday will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have experienced many successes" and "standing against many challenges."
The summit on microcredits is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen said that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten millions of these households will exceed the poverty limit.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the concept of small loans goes back to the path "initiated by Muhammad Yunus" years ago, which Queen Sofia considers as a "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as a "admirable idealist who had prescribed the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the local loan strategy.
One year later, this experience followed the first world summit in Washington and further meetings at the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we have been able to observe continuous development," the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday made her the assessment as "family chief" in Valladolid and as "president of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by stimulating the attendants to participate in the debate and seeking solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the whole democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic booms, whereas it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that the micro-credits would be an "intensive and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty" and that the governments of the industrialized states should now "more than ever" work under solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to be affected.
For Spain, small loans are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, accused "the success", "marginalized" people who are always in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendants in a city who "opened their gates, enlivened by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to choose the EU President on the basis of general voting
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but has been enforced in the autumn, in particular in order to afford the activists who consider government policy in the Greeks today and perhaps in Italy tomorrow as lax.
The European Commission's proposal for a presidency, proposed by the Bureau, has been adopted almost unanimously.
Under 1001 delegates had only voted against nine, ten had abstained from the vote.
The several minutes of continuing standing ovation, which, due to their intervention events, initially was Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, had no doubt on the part of the three European Ministers of Finance.
The main idea of the Chancellor - as well as the requests - is the following slogan: the response to the crisis is not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also there are nine million jobs directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be expressed by strengthening the control of the European Union of the Treaty of Lisbon on the budgetary policy of the euro area countries, but this could also be the case in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voting "to give Europe a face".
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Surely, it is little likely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposing to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, the delegates, in an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously led to a strengthening of Germany's position.
Therefore, the Chancellor who was concerned about calming the climate within her party has strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European application for the meaningfulness of the German-French Friendship dedicates a section, Angela Merkel does not call on France.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds that Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
Factically one of the highest humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic Army.
What does the fraud represent in the case of sickness notifications?
After family aid, UMP and government are now attacking the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, in order to visit a family aid fund and to present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence of the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which depends on the desire to put the economy into a tough test, but on the other hand, the majority wishes to concentrate on workers' sickness notifications.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is viewing the introduction of a fourth cardiac day before taking into account a sickness notification to workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the wage of four days without the grant of the specific company, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that threatens to raise anger according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", but would help to introduce 280 million euros.
And the more symbolic character associated with another measure: granting the government officials an unpaid cardiac day in the case of disease (so far there is for them, in contrast to the three cardiac days in the private sector, no cardiac period).
While these issues are discussed, the majority also emphasizes the new issue of fraud, which is aimed at the abuse associated with labour abstention.
"Controls will be much more important, and they will also be reimbursed when required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13, before the broadcaster's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of disease notifications seems a little unproportionate.
Indeed, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as of political offensives, which have been most often fruitful.
The French are no more commonly ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first stay with the country-wide numbers.
According to the CNAM National Hospital, more than 237 million euros of daily collections were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health in 2008, daily deductions amounted to 11.3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
This amount fell by 46% in respect of maternity leaves and accidents in work and 54% in respect of leaves of disease, which amounts to EUR 6.2 billion.
And accordingly, 2.5% health expenditure.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, in 2010, the French received on average only 14.5 sickness days compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
A median value that contradicts certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French workers reported that they had not taken any day of sickness.
Another study covered by the health insurance shows that 37% of the sickness reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Thus, compared with their European neighbours, French workers are no longer tend to be incapable of working elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Research Centre (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence ratio (such as or otherwise justified) was oscillated, between 10% and 11% in France against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sickness notifications represents a deteriorational minority in the area of black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, there is only a weak outlet here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on disease notifications exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for education and training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 short-term disease reports, which are in 37,050 cases, were unjustified or too long.
In the systematicly controlled cases of disease notifications of more than 45 days, under 1.2 million 11% were "inappropriate or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this makes 169.000 unjustified cases for several million workers who have claimed a disease notice.
A number representing only a weak size compared to, for example, those of blackwork.
According to the UMP-Deputy Dominique Tian, author of a fact report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily remuneration, and thus much more than the defraudation in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to cover its economy.
On Monday, the 14 November Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced this before Parliament, adding the fact that the Union's government had not given it a hundred days to carry out this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support for our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the Head of Government explained in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October is the 'main task' of the new government, as the country's participation within the euro area is 'in the game', as he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the state deficit of the country by 9% of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights reject the new savings measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the already approved measures in respect of an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but forwarded that his party would not convince itself to an additional saving.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a Assembly of its Party's New Democracy.
He had declared himself ready with the requirements of reducing budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but he was opposed to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary tasks, who had prevented IMF and EU from releaseing the necessary loan over 8 billion euros without a written warranty of all parties on their support for the planned measures, had answered Antonio Samaras that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything under pressure from the outside.
Euthanasia and accompanied free death must be legalised, according to an expert body
The Canadians live in refusal to die, as shown by a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The Board explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together in order to provide the best pain-lindering means, and this also goes beyond cancer.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to death.
Only 9% of Canadians are actually allowed to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and take dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice takes place, in patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
As an open response, experts quote a recent survey of the independent society EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th place, the study notes that "the medical care of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to pain-stilling means, reports the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of the Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of them die at the hospital.
From all over the country, the rate of 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital in Quebec is the highest.
In the ceremonial question concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report are contradicting the position of the federal government, which has already overwhelmed, not to make any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
However, according to experts who have inspired all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would result in abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by uncompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are far more cases of such offences in those countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although here clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians support Euthanasia
Let us imagine that according to an Angus-Ride survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already absorbed in favor of euthanasia, since they feel that they allow people at the end of their lifestyle to milden their sufferings.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalisation of euthanasia does not result in the message that the lives of older or disabled people have less value.
With regard to those who have already practiced a accompanied suicide, the respondents believe 41% that they should not be persecuted criminally.
With regard to maintenance or discontinuation of the resources in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their recommendations that the criminal law should indicate that the discontinuation of the funds for which a legal rejection has been provided should not be considered criminal.
The expert committee also demands that health professionals be trained in the task of respecting a discontinuation of the funds at the end of the life, and that they fear without criminal persecution.
The Board explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together in order to provide the best pain-lindering means, and this also goes beyond cancer.
Lastly, with regard to the means already used in the Canadian health care institutions, the body calls for at least to consider these measures, as they did not serve as much as euthanasia, to reduce physical pain and to reduce the same procedures.
Conservation of other experts
Some health experts have already reserved reservations regarding the conclusions of the Expert Report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described the position of reporting experts, among other things, as they do not set any limits on the euthanasia practice in sick people in the final phase.
"This opens the doors for a situation in which anyone who is life fatigue and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him with his suicide," says RA Deschamps, who had been looking through a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility on all other values involved in the social activity of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist on health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she titulated as "Pro-Euthanasia-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, self a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the report on the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where Euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.

The Partisans Baschar al-Assads have demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Baschar al-Assads, however, which, thanks to Russia's support and a "complot" directed against the country, has been strengthened yesterday.
Two days before the exclusion of Syria through the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan was yesterday the official Arab Prime Minister, who had asked President Baschar al-Assad to lay down his office in Syria, in which around 40 civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"Leave Baschar the interest of his country at heart, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of the political Syrian life," says the King of Jordan, the neighboring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
On the other hand, the Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu had complained that since the beginning of the year the Syrian regime had not been crowned by success.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and cannot be satisfied with this must go," he said in a statement to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey takes a steadily rough attitude.
The United States, on the other hand, welcomed the "consensus to Assad and the powers of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Community, United States, EU, Arab League and countries such as Turkey have an increasingly sharpened tone in view of the repression in Syria," says Mark Toner, a spokesperson of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of government in the region of Dar'a in the south of Syria have died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, had died in "shifting and heavy bomb attacks for Jobar" in the encamped city of Hom.
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Auβenhandel, Walid al-Muallim, nevertheless believed that the country's tax to the end of the crisis".
By the way, he reacted with emphasis to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his tasks, representing his assessment of a "hazardous step".
Syria will not give up," he added, under the contempt, "the plots forged against Syria would fail."
After the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken for the dismissal of UN observers to support civilians from repressions of the regime, that he had embraced in his "Paranoia" to protect him.
An overplaned new meeting of the Liga is planned in Rabat for tomorrow to discuss the implementation of the plan for the crisis rise decided on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the encamped cities and the liberation of detained demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergej Lawrow has, yesterday, classified the decision of the Arab League as a "unkorrekt" to prevent any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on markets to be patient and Italy to be sacrificing
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of government, has called for a little more time from the markets to form its staff and implement a programme that demands "savers" to re-establish the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the government of Berlusconi.
The former EU Commissioner held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before the present meeting of trade unions and employership.
It was his duty to invoke a cabinet in Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrates.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the discussions after he met with the President-in-Office.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Delegated Parties, had, on the other hand, waited for by Mario Monti to put a vote of trust to Parliament until Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will be circulated in the presentation of a list of deletions presented by M. Monti, which will undoubtedly reach from a dozen ministers to the Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the stiff nervousity of the stock exchange and bond markets demanded its time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" in order to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed, in the note that it is "certain that the markets will show themselves durable and sound".
His appointment by the President was welcomed by the markets at the beginning, but the disruption had increased again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The President-in-Office should set up a staff consisting of primarily technocratics, although he had emphasized that he would like to include "politics".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he appreciated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the Parliament's evidence of confidence until Friday.
M. Monti has been committed to working in every urgency within the meaning of the objective, making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman of the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "we do not change our diagnosis to the Italian economy even taking into account the new government".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budget compensation in 2013 despite the savings plans taken in recent months, has requested new deterioration measures.
Emma Marcegaglia", Chief of the Chiefs of Italy, who will meet at Monti on Tuesday, also relies on the need for economic incentives, because a country that does not have any growth which cannot respect deficit figures".
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "Epoch change" of Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "Requirement of Trustworthyness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown was the longevity of his rod.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferential elections, since Italy has to rise for 200 billion euros of public bonds from April 2012 onwards.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a sponge capsule that is used by a nuclear weapon, confirmed a nuclear-risk American NGO on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the results of the recent report by the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents that are based on this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA had notified its "intensive concern" on the occasion of a possible military dimension of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents from ISIS, the 1934-born Danilenko had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Tscheljabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was supposed to have left the centre to establish a company in Kiev that produces "Nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he participated in a Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA's strong indications were that the Irish development of a nuclear pregnant system had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who had not only been very active in this technology, but also, as a member of the Agency’s State State informed, had worked directly on the military nuclear energy programme of its country of origin, beyond its entire professional career."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
The crimes against Muslims and offences have risen by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday during the same period, have either declined slightly or increased slightly.
According to this data, the total number of violence crimes committed against Muslims had increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decline in criminal offences against Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes had been reported.
The total number of "hass-motivated crimes" had risen to 6.628 cases in very weak terms, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences motivated crimes, the FBI.
"After a deterioration in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes grow again," said the Human Rights First Human Rights Organization.The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long been emphasizing that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes, should be regarded as a severe legal disagreement against human rights," said Paul Legendre, an organization’s responsible officer.
"The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these offences," he added that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards the "hass crimes".
The "hass crime" is a heritage from the era of the struggle for civil rights in the US Federal Law.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence directed against racial, skin color, religion or descendance, and now also involves crimes of sexuality.
Twitter is walking the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter Microblogging website introduced changes in the presentation of its platform in order to enable its users to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "activity" and another "name" make it easier to read the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet user whose messages ("Tweets") you are tracking and tracking your news.
This makes it possible to find out whether they allow to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested at a small percentage of users in August before its general Internet dissemination," said Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for his little instinctive functioning, with something esotherically admiring words (RT for the referenced repeat of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisator) faisant le bonheur of the initié, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec on maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
Users on the network discussed this innovation via the Internet with the help of certain "Tweets".
"That's unnoticed, penetrating and similar to too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function "activity" will help me to better track certain elements of my flux twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Registration of a Golden Budget Rule in the Constitution
The government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and to avoid any degradation of rating agencies in the top Bonity of Austria (AAA).
It was the most personal social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the Council's outcome, although the Austrian government debt is 74.6%, so far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payment capacity did not drop on a hit from AAA+, we would have to pay additional three billion euros each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Austria also calls for the Brussels Summit of the Eurozone Member States on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government would at that time have required a reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the public account balance to the Constitution or the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country that had included such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 onwards, the structural deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% margin of GDP, whereas the regional states and municipalities should have balanced households.
The aim is to eliminate budget debt under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Agreement in the horizon of 2020/21.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens new intervention in monetary markets
On Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned that the Japanese authority would re-intervene in monetary markets if the Yen continued to rise.
"If we set an excess volatility" in the Yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was in turn near the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese currency value, which has been driving a new record value over the dollar since 1945.
However, the Yen has risen regularly over it, dropped by the purchases of investors who view Yen as a "reliance value" in these unsafe times of world economic deterioration and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro is shattered under the symbolic lat of 105 yen near the levels that the last intervention had struck.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This strawfire of the Japanese devise harms the exports of the archipelago, as it deals with the cost of the Made in Japan products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the Tsunami on March 11th, which destroyed the Tohoku region (Nordosts), for its reconstruction," stresses M. Noda, who fears that this thrill of the Yen could already kill the weak rise in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter, the third economic world power has gained -1.5% in comparison to the previous quarter for the first time this year thanks to the rapid export growth and the consumption of "plombed" households.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the Yen's toughness does not reflect the Japanese economic foundations.
On the other hand, the Minister for Finance Jun Azumi asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to defuse the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, has notified that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures" to explain that on Wednesday there is no additional monetary triggerance to be expected.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the note bank increased its State Obligation Purchasing by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) in order to cut down the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) coverage amounts that it used for various purchases of financial titles to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest feet fast to the height, stock exchanges make withdrawers
The risk of infection of the debt crisis continues to undermine the European figures.
Despite the recording of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to increase.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, also drifted this Tuesday, November 15, a little more in negative bills.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"According to the new tensions regarding government bond yields in the Eurozone in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to spend part of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters Press Agency.
The stock exchange in Tokyo, which, on its part, suffers from the renewed fear of market participants in Europe that the debt crisis continues, had closed with a baisse of 0.7%.
"Japan, as well as the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade is on limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revival of anxiety about the future of the eurozone damages the single currency that continues its Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a year and a half months.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, so it gave up by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange agents, she has declined after the CDU, the party of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the convention on Monday, had submitted a request, which, in particular, provides for the possibility of withdrawing from the euro area in difficulty countries without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
Italy and Spain’s loans are still at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, the one of the Spanish titles matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian government leader Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
On the other hand, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visor of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The interest shear ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year-old obligations has again reached a new historical high.
Expected growth figures in the euro area
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the bases of the figures of the second quarter, with a minimum of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that is most disturbing economic experts.
Germany had a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first bill of the entire euro area is expected at 11 a.m., warning the EU Commission against the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should be victorious about dogma
If there is an issue that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take a election meeting for the occasion to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be fruitful if it sends the overall economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is leading to double electricity demand by 2050, it is not supposed to have to give up a huge share of the world's population for a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce constant electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision of the need to find a substitutive source, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
In contrast, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name only a few states, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
On the other hand, the United States decided to join Fukushima in another unit in their park by reopening the three-mile Island plant that was suspended after the nuclear accident.
Even though the German model, oriented to renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as a model, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will defuse the electricity price, an increase in energy dependency on import gas, in particular on Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The total number of these inexperienced effects will be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives reason to think.
Denmark, on the one hand, is European table leader in wind energy, which refers to 30% of its electricity; on the other, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternating with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 output and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the continuity of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity account compared to our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy represents a key role in competitiveness and a stability phenomenon of industry on national grounds, the French companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Every significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in energy price, which will read the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power to illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the large majority of the French are equally unwilling to pay, as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us imagine that the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a huge amount of small and medium-sized enterprises into the international markets and makes them an innumerable number of jobs.
If France took the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would be victims, and the annual 6 billion euros of investment goods and nuclear energy exports would decrease increasingly.
Which electricist would order an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the fall of his producer was pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is no such thing as a devil’s work as a miracle for the production of electricity.
The CO2-arm solutions developed by Areva are evidence of the complementarity of the energy sources for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy.
Maintaining the maximum level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that is carrying out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, which have made a name because of their professionality, are just obsessed with the security presentation.
Within 50 years, the core industry has experienced three serious disturbances.
Only one, and one in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions, so he was without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was sworn by reactor construction and infinite human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by masses that caused the death of several ten thousand people.
The core industry will draw its teachings from this accident as it did after the two preceding.
As the fruit of this approach and the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and engineers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft which enables him to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical technicians to build a nuclear power station, a building stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading them free track to travel the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear development itself.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be unanswering to dominate emotions, dogmas and party men who also determine economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration burden or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "land of human rights", as France itself had called.
Recently, the temptation against foreign students had marked the weekly views of the authorities, and the Interior Minister had temporarily announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "no talents, Maurer or Kellner from abroad needed".
But this policy was rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this subject between the right and the left.
On the right, Jacques Chirac's tone, who explained in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigration workers, should not be a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France could not take up the entire poverty of the world".
The only difference exists in the degree of high speed
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by Hordens of Polish Klempner was divided from both right and left in 2005.
From both camps the immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference exists in the degree of large-speedness that one wishes to consent to the immigrants.
Francois Hollande, in his programme, is limited to banalities that point to partnership development allowing us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect elections, but it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron see us in a recently published work, which summarizes the latest findings about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive impact of immigration flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in immigration countries.
Restricting immigration would reduce growth and harm the labour market situation.
The fears of the migrants' influence are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute the local workers, in particular the less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that the immigrants are in fact much more complementary than the local workers, as they are exercising major jobs in sectors that are not technically exhausted.
The low-qualified immigrants work in sectors that travel little local wage workers, the more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not in line with the job offer.
Positive wage effect
As a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthesists, this complementarity also results in a positive effect of immigration on wages and national labour market situation between local and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigration flood results in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of idea addiction and economic growth introduced by immigrants is attainable (high share of immigrants among American nobel prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute net to social systems, in the European countries averaged about 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that an immigration person at the age of 30 to Germany averages a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around EUR 150,000 to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring the missing cutting points with the teeth to his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which should scare immigrants, achieved precisely the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember himself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed the entire 20th century over the tragedy of the First World War, totalitarianism, Holocaust, Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some would have believed that it was sufficient to exercise voting law, in the immediate way possible to see democracy defeat their enemies once and for all.
One knows since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a characteristic of mentality.
The general electoral law, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is insufficient for this and can become as well as the "suppression instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed at the time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of forces, a training, information, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are, is an economic crisis, but it is as much and first of all political and democracy crisis.
In this respect, the transformation of the Greek True-Falsh referendum would have had double-intelligence: once the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be regarded as obsolete.
The truth is that the frontlines of democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to win in order to insist on a success of the national referendum, which was organized in dependence on the necessities and in the wrong order.
A release for the European sole ruler or a jump with connected eyes into the emptyness of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, clarified and continuously, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one knows no more where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it rules in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that has tougher the dictatorship of the markets and the credit rating agencies, which suffers from its ignorance and its lack of solidarity.
It is whole Europe that is humiliated at international level.
One is worried about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and so each of the nations it is.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to the people's sovereignty.
For it is up to the whole whether the Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, make themselves free from markets, and drive a future through investment.
The outbreak of the crisis has decisions at European level on a condition which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy without having to lead us to ruin.
After this proposal has been struggled by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, everyone today urges European economic governance.
All right.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - this would be another foolishness and a further sackgasse.
We must take a new stage in European development.
In order to create the Republic in France, the fact needed to "create Republicans".
The revolution of interests alone could not afford to be sufficient here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European national sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"contactless" chip cards become general
The world trade fair for chip cards opens their gates on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 should end with a 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The worst segment is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply keeping the card on a reader.
Unlike 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide!
Their market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and over 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins with regard to the contactless payment to soil, after it has been behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept these.
In France the beginnings are rather modest: Only 400 000 contactless visa cards have been spread.
However, consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has therefore emitted 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to increase speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically distribute their customers bank cards with contactless chip in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
To date, a low percentage of devices is equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) required to carry out these transactions.
"They have been deferred."
"But at least next year they should experience a real upward development."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will expire from December to June next.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees should be equipped with a capsule that permits contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also said yesterday to prepare the market launch of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact by phone.
Terrorist front is understood, from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The relationship between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to be confirmed for a long time.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Auβenminister Abdelrahmen Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now gained "certainty".
"The way with which both organisations act and the relationships of secret services indicate clear cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigations on the abduction of two French in Niger, which took place last January, have promoted interfaces at day.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, which were kicked in a restaurant in Niamey by pendants of the Aqmi, should have been killed at the same time the following day as several of their kidnappers in the event of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists in the debris at the site of use.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the phone calls leads to several conversation partners located in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two conversation partners: One number leads to a Nigerian who has long been in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, who had stopped the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but it is certainly necessary to wait for more clear evidence before one can speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It is, however, conceivable."
"For years, it has been known that the sect relates financial and intellectual support of autumns and that it is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo mildens.
In these last months, these "support benefits" have become more and more eye-catching in their course, as well as the talks and operation modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the use of suicide victims as well as the use of ever-complicated explosives that have the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community, to start with Washington, has been exercising pressure on Abuja since then, so that the problems caused by Boko Haram are taken into account there.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have considered the group as a community of illuminates for a long time, which should not be given special attention.
Fast Success
The Boko Haram founded in Mayduguri in the area of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which means in Haoussa as much as "the Western education is a shame" - pursues the establishment of a Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this mediocre region, the merger has rapid successes.
It polites and claims strict compliance with the Scharias, while the activists they are occupied in the fight against the wicked central government.
The activists initially have churches, bars and authorities in the vision.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active with their intensified attacks against the Commissioners.
However, the reaction from Abuja is as usual indifferenced.
The army circulates the city, it counts 800 dead.
The Mohammed Yusuf in captivity is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its fortunes in the north.
She announced her last Christmas for an assassination in Jos, which demanded 80 people's lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was given the debt of a suicide-patient who occurred in the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations is a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axle in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania over Nigeria to Somalia, has been disturbing all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalis operating al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and showed herself ready."
The world within the scope of the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and the aid for Israel.
Can a crisis weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say, unpleasant ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates in this way, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mid Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their competitors have repeatedly clarified their thundering statements as well as their statements on the outer policy, traditional republic focus.
China, Iran and Israel's aid fall over slogans - often undermined in no way.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest level in the course, the Chinese threatened to quote before the WTO and to accuse them of the leading topic in an America that is driven by the migration of entire industrial industries to Asia at the earliest.
Dumbly running if this is to imply the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of autumn policy, has almost cut off the air with regard to his emotions smileing gestures.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of conversations with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not heard because he is staggering into the depths of the opinion surveys.
Reagan's Eben Image
Romney had also praised military beatings against Iran if the sanctions were to fail to stop the nuclear programme.
"If I am elected, I command to stop Iran," he had toneed.
"If Obama is reselected, they get the bomb."
He also promised Israel to be more military aid and accused Obama of being guilty of this partner's obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest occupied candidate, has a shameful dossier ignorance.
Recently, he called on to give the Chinese military threat to contra, as Beijing's attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and it seemed that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and demands military beatings against Iran, goes on to be ready to take the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The retirement of torture againstmutable terrorists by Obama 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and the Candidation Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an outer political weight.
The current presidency counterparts, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama was also a amateur and had to give water in his wine, as to the subject of antiterror.
They are rightly persisting in the failure of his naive onions to Iran, the hurry of his "young" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
However, this opposition is not so unnecessary.
The population rather estimates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama is more surprised by reasoning that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to awaken his leadership to a new life.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seaside of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, was operated.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to do this event with glory and Gloria.
Over 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, have attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his office school Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically turned the tax of the valve, which transports Russian gas into the western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27,5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gases per year will be delivered to Western Europe by a first 1,224 km long pipeline linking the Sankt Petersburg region to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline allowing a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the total French consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of the construction of a third line on your own route.
For Gazprom the timely and point-to-point completion of this huge building works like a victory.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream-Pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any traffic through third countries (Pole or Ukraine) on the country path.
For this reason, these two countries lose some power: for them it is now more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the strongest involved in the debate, was not forgotten to compare the North Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for Poland's occupation in 1939.
This means that the topic is politically too sensitive.
Western Europe has gained an even higher security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of defence of European energy, as the project has hit a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, which have strong gas consumption and their gas resources are deficient in just five years.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed the initiation of the gas pipeline by pointing to the degree in which the large gas contracts are also of political and economic importance.
All of this explains the wide smile of the Gazprom manager represented in Lubmin as regards gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete refining to protect it from anchors.
It rests on the sea ground, in about 200 m deep.
During her construction, mine fields dating from World War II had to be wipe out.
"Every hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed in caution," said Jens Müller, spokesperson of the company Nord Stream.
Furthermore, enhanced measures were needed to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long snake made of metal, heavy like 242 eiffel towers, which has been interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither through valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in front of the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders took a distance from it, as Sweden was little inclined to see a Russian state society settling on their coasts in a permanent way.
"In the case of a havarie, we close the gas transmit in less than a minute," Jens Müller specified.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipe is in the air.
This case, however, is considered by the constructors as little likely, as the sweat seams were estimated for a resistance of a leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of gas transmission shall be ensured by a sub-water robot controlled for external observation purposes by a sea vessel, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, having a diameter of one metre, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three complete days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal when it arrives.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without having to be subjected to the least repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their powers to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are incorporated here (each to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch gas union and the French group of GDF Suez (each to 9%).
These five companies have formed a company called North Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport to extendable Twenty Years Treaty.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real amount of transportation of gas is", specified Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas transmission construction was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are equal to recovering their expenses, as Gazprom alone carries the liability risk.
The gas pipeline occurs on a sandy coastal stretch of pine forested by Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas exit trail.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transmitted to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
A Italian company launched about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the letter a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent in candle with writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular tape, its rubber band, the egg-scaled sides, as ageed over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as one knows it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its seat in Milan, decided at the time to bring a distinguished design notebook to the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then specialist consultant of the company, is entrusted with the introduction of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-themed production technique called Mole Skin (Mulwurfshaut), which describes a cotton bag that is used, for example, for covers of cotton benches.
This type of notebook was very demanded by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which was considered an icon of avantgardist artist until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand responsible to Modo Modo.
The success takes place.
Between 2006 and 2010 sales increase by 26% and establish themselves with a paragraph of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far away from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phenomenon of the buyers, as the notebook enthusiasts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which was 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in books, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and understands to enforce its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and his new need for writing, which exists despite the upturn of the e-mail," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: the brand recently launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)" in which architects and artists issued their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a band with a leopard pattern at the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit and understood to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computers... The brand shows the entire range of articles.
A success that adds to the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investmentphond SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus launched a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled persons remain at such a level?
Approximately 19% of the disabled are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" starts.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average average: 19% compared to 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, so emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, which sets out the "week of work for disabled people".
"The progress made within fifteen years is significant."
"The unemployment rate was not double then, but three times as high."
"Notwithstanding, much to do remains to be done."
However, it must be said that there are many obstacles for disabled unemployed before they get a job.
The elderly are more common: 37% are older than 50 years (17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no abitur and only 10,000 disabled people are under 2.3 million higher education students.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also widespread: 53% in disabled people compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-employ, and the "form the core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a Association founded in 1992, which helps companies to acquire disabled workers.
So much to the material brakes.
Stay the unexplained, the mental attitudes that, although certainly, develop, but slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre Association for the magazine La Cité suggested that the interviewed managers have "a weak level of knowledge about disabled people", which is "overrepresented" by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually inferiors.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees have a wide way ahead of themselves to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was established in a 1987 law.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a quota of 2.6%.
"We are now with the 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization which is commissioned to make contributions from companies who disregard this law.
The evidence: The number of "paying" establishments has also decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for contribution increases, put a strong pressure on the companies, explained Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses real knowledge, especially in the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard:"What a luck"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had not concealed their pleasures that brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too far to claim that there has been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Side by side on the viewer stage of the Stade de France sitting, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have been able to close peace and peace.
Five months after the temperate gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had harvested nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the born Liller assures him.
As for the contrast between his representation in Club and National Elf"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I'm all over the year, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday evening against Romania with regard to the match against France to finally shine."
However, without letting the note of "pleasantness".
The French national team has been furnishing since the age of seven, its victorious campaigns led between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he confesses.
"We just walked over the way."
"To allow them to play means great happiness!"
Leekens, on his part, reads with kindness "Stolz".
"The pride to bear a galamate."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its property as "nearside" - that France" has again become a team at a very high level", and that is little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done fucking good work," he said excitedly.
Although Belgium will miss in the next Europe championship, the technician is very likely to see the plane split with the Blue (the French National Elf) ... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he emphasized.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"They will notice the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal is very confident
With great optimism, the Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward to the replay against Bosnia at 2:00 this Tuesday in Lisbon.
During the replay, both teams had missed the matter.
"On the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees itself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means in fact only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play and serve off an opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obviously that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the party over more than an hour, but the team was not able to repress the matter the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but it is a certain risk because we have not achieved an outward gate."
At home, however, in her brightly shining city de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they are in the face of a audience that should be equally close to the game, even if the party was announced of course as "very scarce", said the optimistic but clear-looking Bento.
"We expect a very scary match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have a 50% chance to be at the 2012 European Championship", however, Carlos Queiroz's successor was relative.
The unmistakable on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to achieve and win a gate.
The Bosnians, who also need a gate, can already be satisfied by discretion.
"This is a good result, but it poses a certain risk as we have not achieved an outward gate," regrets Bento.
"We will fight against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese have already intended to exercise maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning, in order to "give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
