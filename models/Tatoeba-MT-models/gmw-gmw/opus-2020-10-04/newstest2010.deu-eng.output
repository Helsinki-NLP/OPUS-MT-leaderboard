Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
The American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US president in history.
He also receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
Afterwards the presidential couple planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its highlight with the ceremony, where Obama takes over the Prestige prize.
He receives these as the fourth President of the United States, but only as the third who receives the price directly in the office.
The White House already realized that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan War when the prize is taken.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he accepts the price as a president who is currently leading war in two countries.
He has strengthened the efforts of war some days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the cheque over ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to donate for beneficial purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific charitative work.
The event programme will then provide a banquet with the President and his wife, where the Prime Minister and 250 invited guests will be present with the exception of Norway's king and queen.
Obama was very reluctant from the beginning to the price.
He suggested, for example, that he had the feeling that he didn't deserve the price completely.
He also repeated several times that the price was not only for him, but for all who seek the same values as he.
Immediately after the notice, he noted that this is for him "requirement for action".
Nature Protector is accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz Police accused the chairman of the Civil Association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for extortion.
In several cases he invoked appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his professions, he demanded money from the investors for his benefit, said the Leitmeritz Police Speaker, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaft, Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in jail and it threatens him a prison sentence of up to three years.
Sorting garbage containers in Brünn don't smell good
In Prague people can sort the drinking packs, in the southern Moravian villages you can find again on a step and get the sorting garbage containers.
And in Brnn?
There you need to book a few minutes to find the appropriate trash tones.
I don't want to say that the separation of waste in Brünn wouldn't work at all.
But it seems to me whether the councillors are insufficient about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brnn is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because as citizens here in the sorting containers we are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics, but especially through the number of waste tons for such waste.
Did they at some point in the center try to dispose of the PET bottles in a collecting basket, for example?
That's just art, before all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found up to now randomly is the Morning Square compared to the Gans found.
Mr Unterka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but that seems much too little to me.
Apart from the fact that waste separation is not a honey swallow in other parts.
Therefore, whole rows of my friends don't want to sort the waste at all.
From lazyness.
It's too far to the garbage tones.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself after the celebration to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street, I haven't seen a shade of color.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on tram ride.
The garbage almost passed.
This is still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and any kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brünn Socialists cold.
You prefer to buy the city a ice hockey liga that makes us shame throughout the Republic instead of buying a few trash tons more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner bron.
I am glad that I could confirm my assumption with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brnn is really the worst in the district of South Morning.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness allowances
After the left party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sickness funds and construction savings.
But neither for the government debt interest nor for the international court disputes.
This causes even more problems that will be at the government next half, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expected that the government would additionally borrow the money for the sensitive expenditure, pensions or sickness benefits. "This is just a breakdown of the problems in the future, mine lay," says Janota.
The loans are gradually paying higher and higher interest rates, and you have to reimburse the money sometime.
Too much to choose where to take, the state cheese is empty.
If social benefits or costs are not reduced for the State undertaking, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the fire fight, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
To retirement or sickness allowance, whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people must not be afraid they get this money.
But for the price that the state is even more indebted - the next year, the state cheese will not only lack 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will increase increasingly, together with these, the costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity money as made by the government in its local deficit package.
Due to the decline in money in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing for the development of motorways and railways in the next year.
It is mainly the sections obtained in the competition that can no longer be reprojected and possibly reappointed.
Most of all, whatever is not free.
This means delay or discontinuation of thirty large buildings, also threatened by Europe's money added, warns the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the flow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ agents in which the State is the owner of majority, and from which the money will be distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of dividend is never safe and it is not an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ had a total of 18 billion in the budget.
Each year, dividends pay the environmental liquidations, the pension account fills up and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to the Nieveau of 5.7% GDP according to EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the revolutions yet.
Almost three billion fell the budget for various compensations for victims of Communism and criminal offences or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state gets done without this money is not sure.
That's just gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay that anyway, Janota clears it.
The Minister must then save the money in the interior or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the two-milliard project "state chess", which is intended to allow on-line monitoring for what the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions will come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future with a cell phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing one key.
The plans submitted are promising.
It's enough to press only one key, and Windows Mobile will be in a few seconds changing Android.
This is exactly this way the American society wants to introduce VMware, which focuses primarily on the development of the virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to run two user profiles on the mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallelly, Srinivas Krishnamurti suggested by the company VMware at the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
There will be 2012 on the market.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware successfully presented the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One thing was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which simultaneously the above-mentioned systems run Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for the mobile phones is fully trained.
The company VMware is now working with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualising and to the customer to come the devices within 2012.
Snow deficiency on the mountains tortures the hotel owners
Scneeless slopes don't just worry about the giant mountains.
The missing snow also shakes people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Giant Mountains you can still enjoy free rooms for all winter seasons including Christmas and New Years.
Our pages are often visited.
People are going through the offers, fixing the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether we think that this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on match", the operator of the Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Those who want to stay in the spindle mill exactly according to their ideas should no longer hesitate to order.
If you prefer to save and where the quality of the stay comes in second place, you can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mainly weekly stays for the New Year’s Day.
I think they're gonna try to sell them for a while, but then they must also give up and enter shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, estimated Jandura.
Free beds at all winter dates always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we're most interested in the Christmas Week, which hasn't been sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, noted.
The New Year's Day in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi Travel Office, but there are less free spaces here.
Good paragraph also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in giant mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are cut in a week, the Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Reverse and slightly better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou can be occupied.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On the New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne for 80 percent of its stay.
On Christmas, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
This year, this year, we were surprised at about 60 percent for which we are now already occupied.
A little weaker is in the meantime of February, but at the moment when the snow comes, certainly also the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, stated.
The Giant Mountains owners are now waiting for a larger snow shelter.
On Thursday it was to cool off, and if it comes to rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
Afterwards, however, there is another warming, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Replay is Mother of Cleverness
It is almost funny with which student stubbornness Barack Obama, the president, with his reputation of the cleverest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the question of Afghanistan, which he himself considered the stupidest.
Finally, when he swept out his expected Afghanistan doctrine, it proved that he wrote it off over the copy paper from the Busch Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only that he uses the speech "as in Iraq" in the text himself several times, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forwards" without swearing.
He even criticized the Bush-Idee - fresh troop quotas in Iraq plagued by the civil war three years ago - as an "unresponsible and in its consequences karastro-physical decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, which was based on military recommendations, was the only possible and in so far as very successful that the news about Iraq was no longer spoken at all.
Bush's reputation was not improved because, objectively, he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat.
In order to increase the troop quota, the military again asked him, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite the subordination habits, strongly criticized the tempering shots in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation to improve.
The president hesitated three months, but did not come to a better idea, so he deceived the General weists around 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even though he was originally expected to have at least 10,000.
Highly problematic in the whole of the Obama strategy is his project to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan already in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-up will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the brother's war in recent years, the Iraq Society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can rely on anyone and no agreements are made.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to change their opinions every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally properly established, remain only shine buildings behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interest between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the insurmountability of the conditions which further complicate Pakistan and Iran influences.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "treatable state", which is the minimalistic goal of the entire operation.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy is alienated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now at the edge of the explosion.
Believing that the small soldiers, who have broken out in the war cry over the "early home" return, can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that can't be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the defeat of troops is purely unresponsibly because the Taliban will accept it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the European willingness to participate in the fights in Afghanistan is inclined.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindusch Mountain Front.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem is not to be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period during which America takes off to Obama for a victory withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But every solution will also mean a dramatic turning in the Afghan situation.
The only pavement for Barack Obama is the fact that three years until the presidential election remains, and therefore it remains enough time to take a different strategy, it would prove to be a total failure.
The managers of the Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This has announced the company that reacts to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers gets shares instead of the money, but they can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from managers if they act excessively risky.
According to the Reuters Agency, Goldman Sachs is at the top of the efforts to connect Wall Street's premium bonus with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the ongoing direction in which it has to go, the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, suggested.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after she had set aside for the first three quarters of this year nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses.
The total amount of premium bonuses during this yeara will probably exceed 20 billion dollars after the Reuters Agency despite today's measure.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to tax the bonuses of bankers exceeding 25,000 pounds once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also prepared by France.
This year, women have won the nobel prices in all departments, except in physics.
Today, five record women in Stockholm have taken over from the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf this year's Nobel Prizes in the categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine have received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greyer, along with their countryman Jack Szostak for research in the chromoson area.
Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, received the price of chemistry for information of the ribotic structure and function.
The last Laureatin gave the Nobel Prize for Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a nobel price this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao for research in the glass fibre area and George Smith along with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax devices or astronomical telephony.
Each of these winners has received the diploma Nobelmedail and certificate on the acquisition of the money price.
It is ten millions of Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money price is divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has received the most expected peace nobel price in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his way, and is also at the top of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In respect of his policy, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the fighting of world peace, even if the price is high for them.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus received early on Friday the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who thinks about his remaining in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remainder of Janota in the cabinet will be the themes of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, which Klaus now receives for signature, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
Parliament, however, voted on Wednesday on the left party proposals on monetary change and increased the money for government officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has prevented the social democracy's proposals to increase the budgetary deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the legal party, on the other hand, a sharp internal political dispute has arisen, which causes the questionnaire about the further work of the fishermen's cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in spring.
Criters claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of savings that the fishermen government has carried out in autumn, which, after their understanding, should end the state debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the government budget, but does not need to sign, today, with the entrepreneurs in discussion, said that the politicians have neglected the "intensive problem", which represents "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
His opinion is that there is no good solution today.
Improvement could only result in a strong government which could be built on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS Chairman, Mirek Topolanek, noted that the budget is cruel, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party is obviously no longer working.
In the editorial, Premier Fischer described similar words as "strong expressions".
The CSSD Chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the catastrophe is grievous that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and the 200 billion crowns exceeded.
On Wednesday the CSSD evaluated the approval of the State budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unattended" of the world shows much of the country, whose struggle and victory despite some criticisms, that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, racial relationships and Nelson Mandela.
The unfortunate fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life history the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in Eastwood film.
Another significant role is Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in Eastwood Drama from the box section "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which the end became a slave holder, a fictional U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but only rarely one who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in the termination of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set freely in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeat" and at the same time is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, who was published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film describes a real event where Nelson Mandela joins his forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Piean, to agree on the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided even after Apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through sports, so he decides to agree to the Rugby players who belong to the world's externals.
Finally, the South African team rises to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role so as to approach it as close as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, to eat with him in the evening and to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that if I shake your hand, I take your energy, it is transmitted, and I felt I know what you feel, he said.
It's important for me to have become another person.
Matt Damon represents in the film François Pienaar, captain of the National Rugbyteam, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Piean for the first time in his house.
I remember when I sounded to the door cling, he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the director Eastwood "Invictus: unshaked" and one also speaks of views on a Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good history, very well done film."
In the film reviews on the web pages Rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Resolved light secrets about Norway: Russians have tested a rocket
Over Norway, an exceptional light effect of unknown origin was observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
But again, the start was not successful and the rocket called "Bulava", which was originally the pride of the Russian army, will become slowly the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of sample flights.
Bulava has usually not been started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, one already writes about "Bulava" as about "a rocket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't flee but shines
This already 13th attempt, was at the beginning normal.
Only at the end of the flight have technical damages to the rocket occurred again.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket level.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atom-U-Boot Dmitrij Donskij, which sailed under the water of the White Sea.
This rocket type allows the shooting from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over north was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian missile since the first moment.
The generality has retained itself this time and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the accident was only affected by the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was done without a mistake, the management of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen successful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfills the generality with optimism and continues to claim that the "Bulava" will fly without problems once and will even wear up to ten hypersound atom heads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at 51 years
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov again presents itself in a professional ice hockey game at 51 years.
The former world champion, Olympic and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow in need, and is likely to take place in the Fridaysduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career with forty years, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some other formalities, the Agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morality of other players, led fellow player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice area, he will be the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary storm Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with one and fifty years and was able to benefit 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makanov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships and also triumphed in Canada Cup and in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gathered successes in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup twice over his head in the Detroit Dress.
He has been a member of the ice hockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai gave up the trade unions. All overtime hours are lifted
The management of the Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union to withdraw all overtime hours.
Due to frequently arranged overtime, the trade union announced the strike willingness on Monday.
That confirmed the speaker of the Hyundai automotive factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the Executive Board wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime hours were proposed for the reason that two working classes would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday class.
The employees will also receive them for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of the staff for the proposed overtime hours.
Either they can pay for the overtime surcharge or they can take substitute holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek stated.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will be paid the ticket and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtime was the most urgent and burning point in relation to claims and complaints of the trade unions who had stopped production last week, management decided with immediate effect last afternoon on the withdrawal of all overtimes for December, Vaněk launched.
Up to last week, the employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work almost every day after eight hours.
The signing of the agreement will revoke the strike willingness of the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions will be held on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfilment of the demands and sign a common document, they are willing to lift the strike willingness.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automotive factory was sharpened when about 400 employees spontaneously struck for constant overtime hours.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged disgraces.
On the other hand, the management held that the staff had to make the overtime hours to meet the automotive supply needs.
The trade unions also demanded in their Monday strike preparation that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday should not be sanctioned.
In the area of overtime, trade unions demand to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they demand the payment of 5,000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Series production was launched in November last year.
Until this September, about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with ́gestolen ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists testes new connections to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact predominates against the disadvantage that the compound on usual virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be healed yet.
Patients can, however, prolong the combination of medicines and prevent the increase of HIV virus in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus reproduction also results in the development of SG resistant viruses, which are no longer effective against medicinal products.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemically-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalocarborane are affected by the protein responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
The metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus increase in a way other than all the medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists get new 'improved' connections prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the viral eiweiß material.
The metalokarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two diverse cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Heavy and Permanent Virus
HIV protease is protease of HIV virus, which is essential for the virus's life cycle.
Without the HIV virus splitting caused by HIV protease, there would be no mature viral particles.
When we disable HIV protease, we also disable the proliferation of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists in the press report published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Scientific Magazine Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of connections in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further modified.
Somewhat weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease is tested in the reagent glass, including against their constant (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as clinically used medicinal products, but does not lose its effect on the resistance variants which are often unefficient to the medicinal products used.
The unique efficacy mechanism, as well as its other characteristics, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical designs, makes the metalokarborans interesting connections for further research aimed at developing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institutes for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute for budget. ODS went on fishermen, who refuses
The Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "horrible" and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The ODS statement referred to the Prime Minister as "strong expressions".
It is supposed to be time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament if it is the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he remains in the office with the help of Parliament's links.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, and Necas has pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, but with link party amendments over more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for government salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has prevented the social democracy's proposals to increase the budgetary deficit.
Czech Republic should operate with a residue of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has responded to the government's wish, because the modified budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisorium. Frase not clear
Disappointment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a senseless feeling, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has suggested that the government still assesses the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation for the case that the amendment proposals would be adopted, the situation would look different.
According to the Czech television, Janota signed up to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he indicated that he delegated his remaining office.
For this reason, his disappointment is about the budget's dismantling.
The extent to which fishermen vote for the further fight with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominists of the Social Democraty (CSSD), who had done the changes in the budget, have nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficiency-increasing laws, for example those relating to sickness and pensions, or the service law.
Topolanek: The Ministers nominated by ODS did not fail
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not made any mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are deputy people who confess themselves to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to refrain from fighting against the deficit level of public finances, it is perfectly logical and correct that he is based on the left majority currently in Parliament.
Then he claims to be unable to expect the support and tolerance of citizens' democracies.
I did not think about it, and when it will be up to date, I will deal with it, Mr Martin Bartak, who was nominated by the democrats, said to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council in the afternoon.
The ODS returned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that on Wednesday, the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament if the Prime Minister expressly asked the citizens' democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not young children, he then responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice would be missing.
Even when I refused the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, most of the things would be positive about the Bolshewization of Parliament and destruction, Topolanek himself reacted.
After the new route plan of the CD (Czech railway), fewer trains will drive for approximately the same price.
The Czech railway ends or limits some less-lasted speed and local trains from 13 December, while other connections are strengthened.
The total volume of transport will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most tariffs including basic and customer travel arif are not changed.
Several connections to the capital receive, for example, the residents of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the type Pendolino.
The fast train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also be driven on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction plans the railway in the Hradec Kralove District (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, on the other hand, can look forward to an increase in Prague and its surroundings.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
Among the greatest changes are the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice must move over in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth road of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The longitudinal routes to the capital will end in the Prague main train station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino connection lines between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will drive over two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have been unable to drive to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's invoice for regional railway: rise by 200 million
Quick trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, totally the railway gets four billion crowns to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year as this year. Local trains provide the districts, totally pay them eight billion crowns in the next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year, regional trains are more than 200 million Czech crowns.
For local trains as well as fast trains, the railway has signed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railways commend the system, perhaps it has not taken the price increase with the large majority of the tickets.
Changes can only be made in case of one-day network tickets CD Net and in case of cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven rod, until now he was for the journey between any district cities uniform and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Millitants arrest more than 50 people, the children have been released.
Millitante kidnapped 75 people today in the south of the Philippines, including some basic schools and their teachers.
This has led to the Agency AFP, which originally only informed about 65 kidnappings.
All 17 kids in prison were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
==References====External links==
Approximately 19 Millitants reportedly used hostages as a living sign in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now endeavoring to publish the rest of hostages.
According to the Agency AFP, the Millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence demanding vengeance between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the law was imposed for the recent massacre, where 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23, which was associated with the election to the Governor Office, were 30 journalists.
Because of the suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Chilephin province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But those who resumed peace negotiations with the Philippinian Government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes into the American cinema "Invictus: the unattended", which includes part of the life history of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against the apartheid has received Morgan Freeman, who had been said to have been elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The role of the legendary South African Champions in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
The cinema launch of the film also makes reactions by critics and the public loud.
Nelson Mandela
He named Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, then in 1993 together with the Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Large expectations are put in the film because it comes to the cinema in a time when, on the one hand, in South Africa, the preparations for the world championship culminate, but at the same time, the media shaken the world’s public with alarming news about the increasing racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants of the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are initially positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywoodstars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that, as you say, I could receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can hear about the personality of Mandelas and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the booklet of British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people united, portrays the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential period.
Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial groups and for years and days separated from each other, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also acts in his role in the South African National Rugbydress on the World Cup, which then won South Africa.
For the entry of the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, predominantly from the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby championship may perform it again to join the people into a single people, the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in 1995 in the national team.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, that will only be seen.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, for example, in recent interview for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to the UK.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out at the transformator of the company Ceps in the circuit system near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district firefire Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, took six units.
Originally, the firefighter wanted the transformers to burn out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is removed with a mixture of water - foam and special fluids.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformator cord.
No one was injured, the Havarie did not endanger, according to the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova, the security operation of the management system.
The damage has been estimated to be more than 10 million crowns, and the damage will only be paid after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must, according to Mandatova, be replaced by a new one.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened with the company Ceps, errors that are rare, it supplemented.
According to the spokesman of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted by the fire of the Trafostation was not influenced the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is active in the Czech field as a sole operator of the control system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 circuits with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transmitted into distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura raises penalty for slandering against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal ads for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from Pardubice District and the head of Olomouc District, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is linked to the endeavour of the company to carry out regional transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term Treaties with the Czech Railway.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take the rosins out, we have only submitted the offer to them over the extent it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railway because we would know the prices of the Czech railway that were completed last week.
So nothing else remains to us but to resist us.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with Europe's law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of the penal notice for the further continuation of the Jancura Medial Show, which serves him as free advertising for his society and for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also invite further ladders to do so.
I assume that in this matter it will also be clear that it is Jancura, who manipulates the public and uses lying and false arguments in the matter of regional railways, has said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the disadvantaged step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura after the districts agreed to the Czech Railway on the operation of regional railways and had not issued tenders for the order in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such a behaviour is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was already threatening a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we did not refrain from losing the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said Jancura today to the radio journal.
vaccination against pneumocococcos free and voluntary
Introduction against pneumocococococes changes the habit from January.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But votes are already reporting that duty vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumocococococococococes are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institution already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines that health insurance must pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
vaccines free for August children
From January onwards, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumocococcos, which were born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received an vaccination dose.
Those who have already started with vaccination in the last year or earlier also have to pay further repeating vaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child's life.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumocococcos.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
As a whole, the experts estimate that health insurance spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year for the vaccine doses.
But they save in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the State has spent about 500,000 a year for all the area vaccinations of the children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococococes cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brainhaut inflammation and blood poisoning.
Infections of pneumocococococes die in us after study in hospitals a year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the duty vaccination of children against pneumocococcos was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be a duty in the future.
From January onwards, they will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
For example, the head of the Civil Association of Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the duty vaccination would be better.
His association is already in the long term for pneumocococococos vaccination.
The experts at the international conference, in which our association was involved, were not very pleased that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in ensuring at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, called Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumocococcos.
At this moment we don't consider that at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about the reduction in the number of vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a volunteer," however, Cabrnochova says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumocococcos from next year.
The vaccination against pneumocococococs is also breaching that it is paid as the first area vaccination by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurances should spend the money on prevention so they save for further treatment, embodies Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this involves anxiety of the practical pediatric doctors concerning the purchasing of vaccines.
After the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and then the doctors receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance could "reduce the money from the health insurance."
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurances pay them.
According to estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
That won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son involved in "Museums Diebstahl"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the police of Pennsylvania, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken into his vehicle when 90 paintings were invited with trailers.
It says that Frank Frazetta Junior and another man had used an excavator to penetrate the museum into the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of shapes like Conan the barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press news agency, the artist stayed in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feather.
The Agency reported that, according to a police-owned statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all paintings into a camp".
The Agency notified that Frank Frazetta Senior disputed to have granted any permission.
Labour defends increases in food and taxation
Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the pre-incidence report against the criticism of opposition, economics and trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling had left an opportunity to "defeat" to show that he seriously meant the reduction of the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.
The Treasure Chancellor was also committed to targeting workers with low and medium-sized income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a 1-% cutting limit of public wage accounts for 2011.
Social security infringement
The trade unions protested that low wage recipients were punished for a recession that did not cause them and warned against future "problems".
The increase in social insurance - to about 3 billion British pounds a year - has annoyed the private economy, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the economic upturn should be considered.
The increase limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year will affect about 10 million workers.
SUBJECTS OF THE VORAB REPORT
Increase in social insurance by 0,5% from April 2011
This year economic reduction by more than 4.75% expected
New 50% tax on banking bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax for small enterprises rejected
Electro vehicles and wind turbines taxes
Increase of state pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer at £90 a year and someone with £40,000 a year will be £190 poorer, while a person with £10,000 will be £120 richer.
Ministers said that their objective of deficiency by 2013 meant "safe decisions", but they also said that 60% of the charges on additional taxes would be charged to the 5% of the top earners.
Financial Minister Stephen Timms argues that the proposed tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"They are big numbers. They will bring us the deficit and this is essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said that he was confident that the economy would return to growth until the end of the year.
Predictions of the Labour Party on the future economic growth – which affects the extent of the new debt and the speed of the deficit deposit – were questioned after the Treasurer was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy will probably decrease by 4.75% this year - much more than the decline by 3.5% predicted in April - while the debt would be 3 billion dollars higher than expected before.
"Forgotten opportunity"
The conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday in order to warn against the "debt crisis" of Labour said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan of reimbursement and press "cynical" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"They haven't said anything important about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour persists that schools, hospitals and the police are preserved from future reductions, unlike the proposals of conservatives, which see the deficit covering coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained by tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were "builded on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements, such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalidity pensions in April, the treasure Chancellor would suspend the accuracy of the voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour continues to provide extra help when people need it the most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Hool food"
Although the ministers have not announced any food details beyond 2011, economists say that pressure on public spending will only be borne in the medium term.
The recognised Institute of Tax Inquiry said that the figures of the Treasurer would mean strong deductions in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," Roger Bootle, economic adviser of Deloitte Economic Audit Company, added.
"This was only the hollow predecessor report. The markets recognize this."
FBI investigates "Festments of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested at an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panshab province, the American message in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was examined whether these are the same men who were reported as missing in the U.S. Federal State of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said that they were looking for information about the men too.
Three of them are to be Pakistani descendants, one is Egyptian origin, and the other has a Jemenite background.
"When they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges that are cast on them and in what circumstances they are held," said speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said that the authority was informed about the arrests and was associated with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington informed that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the Uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that it refused Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton to comment on the arrests, but she said that the USA must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported by your families in North Virginia at the end of November as missing.
Amnesty condemns "miss practices" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, it is still as bad about human rights in Iran as in the past 20 years.
The report details "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the presidential elections contested in June.
A man quoted in the report indicated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Official bodies said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedschad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and killed dozens, which led to the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens received prison sentences and accusers said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now located in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leaders, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak road.
But since then there has been no more tolerance for criticism by the authorities, said our correspondent.
"Falsches confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and the protest against the election results.
"They beat me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in the neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humbled me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was, still bloody and half conscious, released on the street, told Amnesty.
The Vice-President Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and raped others.
The Iranian authorities denied the accusations of rape, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been held in a container in Kahrizak with 75 other more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to examine the disruptions after the election and reactions of the government, but Amnesty, the mandates and powers of these institutions were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark into Bristol into a competition piste.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 half-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
At the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jumping tilt at the beginning of a 100 meters long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said that there was a beautiful view from the summit of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great look with all the lights of the city that glitter below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prices were awarded for the best art pieces exported on the slope - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening the snow is left to melting.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Swiss electors voted for a ban on construction for Minarette and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-founded report on whether Muslims could be integrated into one of Europe’s most declared secularized societies — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French do not love headdresses" (Why the French Don't Like Headscarves) (2006), an elegant and densely argumenting study of a dispute that shared the country over a half decades and whose effects are still to be observed today.
Bowen's newest book offers a more comprehensive and bold spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it is called "Islamic Free Spaces".
He is a good listener, he brings debates between teachers and students on the questions they are most disturbing.
Should a Muslim be married in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it possible for a Muslim to use a zins-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It's these seemingly profaning matters, he claims that make up daily life, in contrast to the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imamen, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have all arguments on their side.
The conservatives are disgusted with the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interviewed Bowen are mostly uneen with their Salafi objects – defenders of Purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He challenges the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionately guarding the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to make their historical compromise with secular republicism.
He recognizes a "differentiation of value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you tend to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most disturbing outlook in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that it identifies melts with alarming speed and takes life with itself, which cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have gone into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their waters.
Richard Ellis, a author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icon of the north, of the ice bear, in "On Thin Ice" on thin ice bear.
Behind in the complex history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting on the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old featherrich to the lake, who only fought with the gun pit of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught when swiming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought into zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears in an imagination.
Even today, zoo facilities still typically have one millionths of the living area of a wild altar. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore became quite green by the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of species.
Although forbidden in Norway, America and Russia, putting in Greenland and Canada continues where hunters in helicopters and motor-sliding Inuit use powerful storm weapons to bring their prey to the way.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the ice" (Original title "After the Ice") Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packing insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphere scientists nor oceanographers can explain the speed of the changes appropriately.
But this is not due to a lack of explanation attempts.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century gave the first notice of the confusion of the pack ice.
In the Cold War, submarines measured the shifting grave during the submarine.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale probes of measurement on icebergs, but much is still achieved by fearless people who camp outside the cold.
Anderson looks at the unique, tiny world of the influential system within the Arctic ice formed by salt water corn halls, which are compressed during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... could be us"
Marine Infanterists were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington Kränze
The top-free De'Angello Robinson traveled with the bus seven hours to lay a single crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine infantists who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Peace Court in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they walked.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington-Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Graveyard in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, continue in different cities along the way to perform events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16.000 cranes on the graves on the Arlington Friedhof, in areas at the Pentagon, on graves of the National Friedhof Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the battery park in New York and at the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than 150,000 dollars for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70 from Westminster, said that she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give back to those who brought victims.
She said that's a little contribution we can support civilians our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family burial.
Packed in locations of warm clothing, the volunteers migrated across the wide grass surfaces and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the first and second world war and the Vietnam war as their goal, as they are not visited as often as the newer tombs, according to the organizers.
The mood was joyful, children played and couples kept on hand while carrying the fresh pine branches to the grey-breaking gravestones.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the dark mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individuals cried open, others prayed and families and friends held together in the iron air.
Some read the names that were crushed in stone, while others bowed down to small black-white space cards that were put in the moist mud for those whose tombs were not yet completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears from the tomb of her son.
She has traveled 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infrastructure sub-official David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been anymore for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the US Government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US authorities for international development and for the World Bank.
Consular officials of the U.S. interest representation in Havana try to gain access to the prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The specific objections have not yet been published, although, under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything under the accusation of the "risk".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities including light protests and critical writings pose a risk of arrest.
Government enemy graffiti and statements are considered to be serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested an authorisation to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably increase the tensions between the Communist Government of Castro Brothers in Cuba and the Obama Government, which had sought a "long" approach to improving relations with the island.
The message of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that the United States will make a counterpart when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desirable products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only been allowing normal citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, and they are used to send text messages today, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a day's wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Too many websites, access is limited.
On Cuba the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind grids because of crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the U.S. interest representation in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information on arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the handling of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", who recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", a response to Raul Castro's office as a leader of the country who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within one day.
He said that every solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives cover plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered a supposedly leading head of conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hoped that this case could help to discover an expanded network of terrorist prosecutors that searched the Internet for radicalized young men.
The investigator said that they had searched for a oppressive rebel known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them out because one of them had commented on terrorist attacks on the Internet video page YouTube.
After they arrived in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribe belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was informed about the matter, said Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy on the undermigration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held over days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the unwavering mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to receive the right recommendations to obtain access to the Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani criminal executive authorities.
The case of five men - which are still in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the candidates in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in the decision of who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11th, 2001, the US secret service has made it a matter of urgency to house human assets within Al Kaida.
The prosecutors of the organization act as a peasants who do not let those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American wishers recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Kaida, said analytics.
However, because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, high-level analyst of the NEFA-fundation based in the USA, said that in recent years terrorist groups have also become much more cautious to whom they are allowed access, because the US secret services have become experts of their recruitment methods.
If you try to put someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded more bold action in climate protection by the sub-dealers at the Bella Congress Centre of the City.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas the police estimates were more than 25 000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists fired small spring bodies near some government buildings in the city centre.
On one day when the climate negotiations supported by the UN did not happen, thousands of activists migrated through the city with transparency, where "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which explained "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys to Peru, the country of birth of her mother, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems that the country faces due to the already significant effects of climate change.
This is part of the motives why I decided to participate in the great demonstration - to continue the word and appeal to the world leaders, to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there's no way to get around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from approaching the Bella centre too close and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or brought with them.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be called because he is involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing burned several sponges near the Copenhagen main channel, near which there are several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they began as a light missile, but then followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's head climate dealer.
When he was asked whether he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I wasn't aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said: "Because the place of events is large, I can't hear what happens outside."
He found that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or freedom of other people."
Examination data show persistent breeding gap
The certificates on mathematics were welcomed last week for public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the schools of the country, the highest achievements are produced, the testimonies show that the fourth and eight-large workers have made faster progress over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Evaluation of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African and white pupils, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average score of the white four-determinants from Washington D. C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but only rose by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African Eight Claimers remained basically equal, it fell around a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data as the sample range was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black four clarifiers in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children have reached of both groups has grown in this period, the difference has hardly been reduced with 58 points now.
Some supporters of the district last week expressed their concern that the results which were celebrated by the school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were promoted most of the white pupils who were already powerful children.
This suggests that we have raised the overall rating by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group, who joins in the gender equality of education in Washington D. C.
I don't jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of exam points is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, one always wants to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what scares me is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the poor students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading plan, the Wilson-Lese system, which aims at students in the upper classes of primary school and middle school, which basic skills of reading have not mastered at the beginning of their school career and which are significant behind their equal classmates.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games from the kindergarten to the sixth class and life-safe experiences, was brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I think that we must continue to work on giving the best measures to the students below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, investigating urban examination results.
The conventional cure is to address its resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could result in political implications that work against this important agenda item.
The weakness is of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that it tries to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the city districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year currently 180 days in Washington to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who with his teachers' union last year came to an agreement over 185 days a year, which he considered as a "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The bus reaches the Gettysburg-College with a loud pimp.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises out and blossoms a moment when the white pillars, the brick facades and the smaragd green lawn are seen.
Gracielas parents have hardly completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was stored in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never put a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight clarifiers of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where teaching costs $38.690 per year, were more awesome than those of an enthusiastic future students.
"Yes, I'll be here soon!" Graciela, who would like to study medicine, announced by the leader that they had now entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she thought when she was reported the low professor-to-graduate ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully accepted the planned message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the USA of hispanese immigrants who do not end the high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands of people who receive college training that are necessary to get up to the middle layer.
In fact, one out of five of this "two generation" of Hispano Americans concludes the college – which is a remarkable performance, as many of their immigration parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the USA without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they will show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the labour force of the country.
Those who investigate powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an indigenous drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of intimacy with American schools.
But counselling programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
If one looks at weak children whose parents do not have the experience and skills of helping them search through the system at any time, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who investigated hispanoAmerican students.
We need to think about providing a supporting network for these children from preschool to high school.
The Bundesprogramm, which Gracielas College-Tour had financed, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a highway - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when income weak students are in the middle school and continue to run until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil concluded with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in renovating the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that has given a command has drawn the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thin seed representatives of American oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its gates after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies give Asian and European the way, Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, said an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security thoughts, which were still underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability by the deduction of the US military probably prevented American oil companies from engaging in Iraq, which has the third largest proven raw oil reserves in the world.
U.S. companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies who could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been assisted with technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the speaker of the Oil Ministry said, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the great ones in the world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to measure itself with its fellow providers and meet its commitments to Iraq.
For the pre-establishment of orders, pre-selected companies gave orders which were then compared to the fee per Barrel oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the emission of each field beyond the current level.
Top Planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In the event of an obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, this week a top employer of Al Kaida was supposed to have been killed, reports representatives of US terrorism fighting on Friday.
This would be the second deadly attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organization in this autumn if it confirmed.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities, had been killed by a number of missiles that met their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waciristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in the unlawful Pakistan tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistani civil secret service from Miran Shah said by telephone.
Local residents who were suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the place and quickly took everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. representatives of the fight against terrorism led uncertain evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as the leader of Al Kaida's military planer who led terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies all over the world, observed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate character of the US air attacks on Pakistani soil.
If one assumed his central role as given, this also included the planning of attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and put them into operation plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somali was rapidly rising in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and maintained best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second government representative, but this does not reduce the danger he posed for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al-Kaida or Taliban leader who had been killed since September, when a similar attack took place in Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribe area and three other top activists.
The pace of CIA attacks by drones has declined from an average of six operations per month to two since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website held by a non-profit organization.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their viability and at the same time kill suspicious informants brutally, the page reported.
Heading UN Messenger in Kabul will resign
On Friday, the leader of the UN in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would resign from his office in March, which would end a stormy term of office that was disturbed by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eides leaves when the Obama government decided to send further 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN Messenger said that he supported the raising of troops, but he also expressed his concerns that the U.S. timetable for the military withdrawal, which should begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to assist in the political conversion of Afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civil side, he said.
Eide said that he did not delegate his office, but only fulfilled an agreement to stay in Kabul only two years in March 2008.
He said he wanted the notification to UNO.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so that he has time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he better starts looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the way my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started searching for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he considered the Swedish-Italian-stummy Staffan di Mistura, who recently directed the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eides position in Afghanistan was tested after his former alternate, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him of prefering President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and of putting evidence on massive election fraud.
Eide rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - which was fired - "had undoubtedly damaged the mission because a large amount of scepticism in relation to international interference in the election already existed".
Eide said that he recommended appointing a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures taken by the American military leaders in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successor to set up more personnel from the United States and other Western countries that donate to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the terrible UN regulations have undermined its ability to bring in qualified people.
The UN rules are so designed that I have been able to set up only one person since May, he said.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like that.
US Minister of Defense Gates: Iran has to expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be "relevant additional sanctions" on Iran because he has not participated in discussions on his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northernirak during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he said in response to the question of a soldier about the likelihood of such development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which the war's own unpredictability."
The Obama Government considers a penalty package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Syrians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is required to "convince the Iranian government that it is less protected with nuclear weapons in reality" because "their people will suffer greatly" from sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the European leaders in warning that Iran has to expect "faithful" consequences if he does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be obtained for peaceful purposes.
At discussions in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that he would resume the discussions on the restriction of his nuclear programme and would refrain from an essential part of his stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for his medical research reactor.
The US Government has urged this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since that time -- partly, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is unanimous about whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran simply abandoned the international community with regard to some proposals which it had already agreed to at the beginning of October has made clear that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, has gathered in a way that they never had been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31th dec as a time limit for Iran to respond to these proposals before following other options, including those called the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once "impressive sanctions".
In an opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian representation has condemned the United Nations, which it called on Thursday "unfound and unfounded claims" to some of the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are willing to continue the conversations with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish government representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays in the US plans from reducing the American troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to scatter Kurdish concerns about the forthcoming troops. The US representative quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change in courses in older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a tomb more".
These lessons have taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course this summer through the low birth rate and the older population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediately and final: "Not at all".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, nothing is left, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single-kin policy in China, the two generations of notorically thick, deferred single children, who are lovingly called "little emperor", have brought up a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen on 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 when this policy entered into force, the U.N.
Determined, while the number of populations of 60 years and older in 2020 should rise from 16.7% of the population by 2050 to 31.1% explosion-like by 2050, which is far above the global average of about 20%.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people have made up nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported inhabitants, while the birth rate is below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Head of Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Comission, said that couples have to get babies in the testable age to help "reduce the ratio of older population shares and reduce the labour shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "so old -- but not as rich -- as the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the constitution of the country in 1978, China's single-child policy should be the most controversial option introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who violate this policy must expect enormous fines -- up to their threefold annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese government representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical demand of natural resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in enforcement of politics.
In rural regions, some pregnant officials who already had a child have forced to dismiss them.
Many couples have also been able to perform gender-celling abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for population have gradually weakened their attitude towards single-kin policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule – including city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was smiled.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, e.g. allowing couples to allow two children in which a partner is a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July, which launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Plakates that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by directives that detailedly describe who comes into question for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and postpone information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outer areas of Shanghai said that a revival of the requests of couples is evident, who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, but the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are still made per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be around 165,000 in spite of the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give the best to her first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 said that they would like to have two children and that this was also legally permitted.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsely evaluate the one-child policy as a human rights question, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we're robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the head of staff, said that she wants only one child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and we used to take care of us.
We are not used to care for others and do not really want this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unfamiliarly.
For parents from the middle level with double career by which the birth rate drops, he said, it turns to be successful and for that one must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20-39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
A single child too, he said, sets huge requirements for the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the room question -- "You have to reconstruct your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you have to have a career for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are ready to endure this one time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of life, he said.
We don't want to make too many victims.
UN Group designs plan for emission reduction
The Climate Conference, which was supported by the UN - which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations - re-established on Friday with the publication of a document, which records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrial nations having to educate the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas control, has shown both the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But he was considered to be important progress in a negotiating process that expires the time, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by a separate UN Working Group, is silent on the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit should be of the global temperature increase that the political decision-makers would contribute.
The process is given a great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-sided document, has summarized a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the UN’s leading Climate Protection Representative, Yvo de Boer, called "the great whole".
It shows the basis for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
On Friday, the European Community also gave the discussions a boost through its assurance to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years in order to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change, from the masters of flooding and droughts to the avoidance of deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that the conversations had determined last week.
The US Climate Supervisor Todd Stern has rejected the wording of compulsory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not financed by industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China, as a representative of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign any agreements without rising up larger emerging countries and taking measures, says Star, who also complained that the text is not far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by foreigners.
Star gave his opinion one hour after the Chinese Vice-President Minister He Yafei declared that the leading American climate dealer lacked either "the reason" or it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
The future economic marching direction of the great world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging countries.
The current struggle refers to the saving of individual economies as well as to the rescue of the planet, while China and the United States are concerned about their commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for who should bear the costs of braking the greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have taken a more aggressive approach to calculating the countries with a very high greenhouse gas tax for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic prerogative, according to Ulate, who is also a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries who are the strongest exposed to the impact of climate change claimed that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the discussions will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The Alliance of the small island states with 43 members submitted a 24-page draft contract on early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "has political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand measures from emerging countries such as China and India.
The discussions received a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions need to be clarified before the government leaders arrive to reach agreement.
High-level representatives, like the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice Minister, escaped their planes and drove through the passages of the Bella Centre to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to dispose of Claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people are daily entering and out in the Congress Centre, guitar-playing activists organize nightly shows, in which they are funny about the countries that believe they are betraying and selling, and contract designs are hand-by-handed instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: Almost all major ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h faster train defines the assembly feeling new
Monday morning at 5 a.m. 13 a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce an admission journey that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed pendulum train in the country will reach 225 km/h at its flash trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and drop 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will then go on board the first Javelin-Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new service will finally link Britain to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and connect the large balancing areas of Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become live pendant cities, working time would be drastically reduced and the transition from plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and the traffic on the streets.
In the theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds, which are necessary for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable massacre of planning and fears of environmental damage could still draw the brake in the British high-speed glands.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will submit the report on December 30, according to the Times.
It thus receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London to the West Midlands will pass through five meters of space in urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger high-speed rail network northwards.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be divided in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel period between London and Edinburgh would decrease to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first subtract that would not be opened before 2025 would allow travellers to relocate the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today a little more than an hour.
The designs would allow trains to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, which would make the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 meters of trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be operating per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This would in turn mean that there would be a final station in London, where 20,000 travellers could be finished per hour.
In view of the spatial restrictions in the capital, an existing railway station is expected to be expanded to retain the high-speed network.
Train experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued in his opinion or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures will mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains should first switch from high-speed trains to existing railroads in the north of Birmingham, thus continuing to travel between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is regarded as a decisive trap point in order to ensure a change from plane to rail, a direct measure for rail revolution.
Taxpayers come up for mortgage for 75,000 pound oranges of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading under-house member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the costs of an orange which he has built in his home in his electoral circle.
The prison speaker of the party, degraded by David Cameron because he complained that under-house members must live "of poorer rations", has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to build an oak wooden plant on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to account the taxpayer's additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
At that time, the responsible of the sub-house approved the applications and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg who carried out a review of the expenditure of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not have been "cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest suburbs, has a two-storey house in a village in his district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have earned a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control station of the suburb, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he has grown a winter garden called "Orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "Glashaus für Unterhaltung".
Duncan was also not invited to take an opinion on the increase in money in recent investigations of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
Last month, after examining its expenditure, the Committee released it from the breakdown of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage over 274,166 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London House to his Electoral House, which he had purchased in 1991, one year before his election to Parliament member.
Documents published this week show that by March last year Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage interest.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
Duncan's RBS mortgage rate has not changed during this period, which suggests that the total increase was used to finance the inclusion of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal levelless RBS mortgage interest decreased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the Unterhaus show that Duncan continued to apply his right to 1.250 pounds (1,400 Euros) per month in May.
Duncan lost his post in September as the opposition leader of the suburb, after a undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the issue scandal that parliament members would live "of lesser rations".
"In essence, it means working for the state that one must live of smaller rations and be treated like S***e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and have claimed a disappearing little part, measured by what belongs to it.
And I could have asked for the whole fucking sum, but I don't do it."
Parliament member, a millionaire from his former career as an oil grocery dealer, was attacked the first time in May for his expenditure, when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before clarifying with the Fees Office that this could be "as an excessive demand".
As a protest in Duncan's lawn, a activist digged a hole in the form of a pound mark, after being known that he had demanded 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved by the Fees Office, as well as afterwards by Leg to value increase."
He added: "There is no debate on falling and crossing or a violation of the rules or similar.
Everything is perfectly perceived and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer at all."
Come all her believers to admire Brighton's beach huts advent calendar
Beach cottages in Brighton have found a new content of life for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to view the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free wine and traditional Mince Pies, pastries filled with dry fruits.
The up to now selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The First Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize thrilling celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and compulsory agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police has held several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could enter into force from 2013 on Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish Chairman of the Climate Conference, increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed completely in black, cracked windows with plaster stones and hammers, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unrest policemen have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your opinion, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, were arrested in the east of France, in April, these extremely violent splitter groups, which have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has been arrested the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers were "without distinction", sharply criticized, and underlined that about a hundred of you "were still held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and sitting position.
The rather peaceful train has gone by Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the planned speakers for a evening with candlelight, taking part in the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have arrived with bushes and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of you with sky-blue rainmills, have made a first race in Copenhagen in the morning, as you followed the call of the earth's friends, "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we go on the streets to demand a reconciliation of the ecological debt for the south, said Lidy Nacpil, filippinian activist of the Annual South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue this way and tell us that we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
Mr José Bové, a member of Europe, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific area, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable as a result of warming, has given the start of the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have gone on the streets.
In Manila there were several hundreds of people, most of them students who marched in red and got Bandanas, in which you glorified the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, there were several hundred demonstrators demonstrators to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (South), in Lille (Nord), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separate Abkhasia has elected his president, Georgia denounced that it is a "strike".
Abchasia elected his president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independently, denominated Tbilissi the "Section".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election following the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control over the South-Osset region, another Georgian secessionist area recognised by Russia.
The election halls closed GMT at 7:00.
The election participation amounted to about 58% a few hours before the election closure, according to the Abchasian electoral commissioner.
The first available results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, repents that Abkhasia is now under restless total occupation, has explained his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognized the autonomy of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is occupied by Russia.
After it had been separated from Georgia during the conflict between 1992 and 1993, with several thousands of people dying, Abkhasia wishes to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have elected for Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to a election place in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palms in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are all over this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abchasian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an indication of Moscow's support, in particular as regards the decision to recognize Abkhasia's self-employment.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, replied and raised a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by the former Vice President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements made with Moscow in the previous year, as the one in which Abchasia leaves Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to neither support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one voice is necessary to win the choice.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second election round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Interval in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty of the Kopenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready for action, has arrested about 700 people, at the outskirts of an important demonstration.
According to the police, a hundred thousand people, according to the organizers, have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which, by 18 December, receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament took the peaceful train towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have stopped about 500 meters from the center and have not tried to invade.
A stage was built to welcome the planned speakers for an evening with candlelight, taking part in the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators who were fully dressed in black and armed with bricks and with hammers began to beat discs, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unrest policemen have immediately circled you and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police announced that 600 to 700 people were arrested and made it clear that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups, which have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
By evening, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin during the incidents, which, according to the police, were temporarily arrested by about twenty persons. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in hand," said the speaker of the police, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces created in the air.
Most demonstrators traveling by train or by their own vehicle from German capitals, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after calling the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climage justice".
"Today we go to the street to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the south," said the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Anniversary South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say, "We have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that are sealing, there are water runs through which one can run, which was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation opponents has approached environmental organisations.
The French MEP of the European Parliament and the globalisation critic José Bové, said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "come with climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer a difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific area, in which there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, has given the incentive to demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizations, about 50,000 people went to the street.
In Manila, a number of hundreds of people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, before the city administration of the Philippines capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organised by the "Net of 350" several hundred people, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycéen.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained that the subjects of geography and history are strengthened from the school reform of the Lycéen, even if they are not mandatoryly informed in the terminals (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th year of school) now have every four hours and the same program," confirmed Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because after him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration "the best pupil".
"The economic-social and the literary profile (ES and L) must not be a sub-profile of the scientist," he continued. He stressed: "I haven't heard many historians and intellectuals who would have insulted about the lack of historical and geographic education in the terminals on technical lyces."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité showed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticized the state project of the removal of mandatory education in history and geography in the terminals S (12th year of school with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also empowered this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
The Minister replied that there was no question about restricting the philosophy of the terminal S programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (Students and Trade Unions) had called for protest against the project for Tuesday, which they believe is the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister concluded that at the beginning of the year, in Master 2 (M2) they are subject to a technical examination and at the end of the year an authorisation examination for which their teaching capabilities are examined.
In addition, they carry out internships during the year in the M2 and then inform the students as a teacher in the internship one year before.
He continued : "If you add all the practices offered before the performance exam, you reach more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister said that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a matter that does not exist in folk education.
He confirmed again that he wanted to abolish the school card "to 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to deal with on Saturday morning at Ecole Normal Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences in which experts turn to the audience for fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach the people and arouse them to want to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the school basin.
"With the experts, around 20 discussion participants were selected, even after their charisma," he clarified.
"On climate warming can be spoken for hours, but the core targets can also be explained in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke about 50 people ago only with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as scientists," he stressed in the hope that the listeners might learn from the fact that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos played by these conferences will be available online from 15 December on the page of the school.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will take place every two months afterwards.
Payment delay : angry prisoners, actions planned
On Friday, the trade unions of criminal executive officials called for a general day of action to achieve that the premiums and overtimes whose payment was suspended for budgetary reasons by January are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The second trade union of criminal executives ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on the employees who do not have service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday morning before the prisoner, in order to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to".
The third trade union of criminal executive officials ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "to unite themselves to a strong mobilisation in the various prisons", on which the non-paying of overtime, night surpluses and sun and holiday supplements in December are written as "shameful and unacceptable".
The first union of criminal enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called on "general mobilisations... to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The executive board and the Ministry of Justice explained that overtime has risen strongly in 2009 and not all in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims are paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice noted in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of the criminal executive officers in which the payment will be guaranteed in the next month.
"I know very well to keep and modernize the staff's efforts to keep our penalty system functional," the Minister of Justice notes in this letter.
"I have instructed the executive body to take immediate measures to ensure that such a situation, which has been created by lack of assessment of the surplus hours, is not repeated in the future," Mrs Alliot-Marie added.
The December wage is therefore less likely, except for the manager who enjoys high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "holding forces" must be held.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille proclaims to boycott "all congregations and recruitments" to new instructions.
"The staff do not go on Sundays and holidays at work, if the hours of October are still not paid in December. This is also true for their overtime hours," threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"In a time when more and more tasks are being occupied without more staff being set up, the attempt to enrich the resources of the staff is more than inappropriate," says the CGT Association of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not equal in all regions, some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he always distributes Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas for the first time with his family in the White House, has lobbyed the TV-Talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he always shares better gifts than he gets himself.
At a special mission broadcasted on Sunday evening via the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle gave insights on how to spend the holidays in their new illustrative home.
Even Bo, the small four-bone companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama decisively rejected her husband's claims on the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she necks the president.
"So please," he confessed her silly and pointed to the bead chain of the first lady: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour radiation in unforced atmosphere with the well-known TV moderator Barack Obama had supported so vehement during his campaign, the President and his wife also spoke about gifts that they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with ten walks and also a basketball that his father, whom he very rarely saw, had brought him with him to Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father visited us Christmas once and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"At a lot later in my life, I understood that I had this ball from him."
The first lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know how to order the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL confirmed that he was moved into the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles because of significant "injuries" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer has been moved into the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was again operated in the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on the night from Wednesday to Thursday, after the American doctors had found damages due to the operation of a tape disc incident in Paris on 26 November, his production company in Paris adding that these damages would have required a new operation.
However, the singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and informed that a new medical opinion would be available at the latest in 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "smart and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, there was a little more certainty about the patient's condition than he opened his eyes, adding RTL.
At the request of the AFP there was no confirmation or comment on the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" indicates that after his first operation in Paris "no sort of drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a band disc incident.
The intervention planned for several days was carried out by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was delivered in the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt that on Thursday his friend was just going through a "deep valley". However, he assured that one needs "no concerns" to make the rock musician because this is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him that it was a foolish sense to sit in a plane after such an operation for twelve hours, that's not going as much," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacted well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was inhibited".
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the woman of the singer, and he had no special concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer’s health had grown ever since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he had crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, the general astonishment was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer-OP", which led to a light infection.
At the end of September, the singer took his long "Tour 66" as a departure tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not missed that the singer at the stage had difficulty moving.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to declare another delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Shortway: First place for Bousquet over its favorite distance
Franz Frédérick Bousquet, three-fold medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, received an international title on Thursday on his favorite distance, 50m free-style, at the Euro-2009 on the short-country track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m locations and the two others by Russia at 4 x 50m locations of the men.
Shad for Bousquet, who wanted to take the 50m freestyle after the world record, whose record he holds in the big basin (20.94).
At one of the two king'sdistants in swimming, 50m free style, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 sec. in a finale with ten swimmers at the start (usually it's eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet compelled the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever larger and in this case I have said, if the world record is in my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers started in polyurethane suits that are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their Epos in Istanbul, which started in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
This time, the use of the combination has not paid out for the German Paul Biedermann, two-fold world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and World Record.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), but with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Counting plate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman graveboard, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It originates from the IIIth century after Christ and was always rated by 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of dionysos are represented in a sophistical architecture decor, surrounded by satyren and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday to the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered most of that," says Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The plate was nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, then she appeared for a piece at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III. French Republic and President of the Council before Marschall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
In searching the database of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "Erbe of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the Thérèse Raquin and the Fresko "Rougon Macquart".
Zelaya's trip from Honduras towards Mexico has been hampered
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the crashed dogurian president Manuel Zelaya on homeland ground as unacceptable after that guide had refused as unacceptable by the Putsch government.
After a call with President Zelaya took place at night, it seems that everything seems to be different about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
According to the immigration authority, the plane issued by the Mexican government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelayas, was returned to its destination.
The Putsch government wanted to require M. Zelaya to "declare" and ask for political asylum under direction for him abroad.
However, the crashed president rejected this, as he wanted to return to Mexico as the most greeted, official head of State.
The Putsch regime "has suffered another failure, trying to move me to give up on my expenses..., they wanted me to thank," said M. Zelaya on Thursday to Radio Globo, in which he often mentions the political crisis that lasts five months in the country of Central America since the beginning of the political crisis.
I can stay here well and like ten years, here I have my guitar, added the crashed president, who had fled into the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some chords.
The Mexican message presented us a request for guidance, which we cannot accept, however, since it does not contain a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the Putsch Government, explained to the dogurian radio HRN on Wednesday.
I'm not looking for asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible trip from Honduras, he had underlined, he would only do as president of the dogurian people.
On Wednesday, the rumors for a trip to M. Zelayas mobilized the followers of the crashed president who had opened up to the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around them, so that the military there had strengthened its efforts.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch Government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal nature of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was crashed on June 28, on the day of the folk survey he organized to prepare for his re-election, against the Council of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21, and had fled into the Brazilian message.
He leaves it, he is imprisoned for high betrayal, of which he is accused by the justice, says the Putsch government.
Putsch President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to dissolve M. Zelaya.
Although Porfirio Lobo was recognised by the United States during the controversial election, the Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil were rejected.
Three days later, the cogress had massively voted against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27th.
Wall Street in upturn, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high, American trade balance figures from a price recovery of the United States shares and their partners: Dow Jones increased by 0.67%, Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures on stock exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, which Nasdaq is dominated by technology from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 was attributed to 1.102.35 points at 0.58% (6.40 points).
There are good news from different industries, judged Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotically under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-filled glasses", so it minimized.
According to Peter Cardillo by Avalon Partners, the investors are primarily fixed on the figures of the American trade balance, "who have an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit dropped by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October.
In contrast, the analysts had expected a deficit axis.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the increase in the total volume of trade, particularly in the export of goods, reflecting the economic growth of the United States' main trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell on corporate research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, the median value of new job seekers had fallen "to the bottom of the year," said Scott Marcouiller by Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.432% from Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds to 4.492% from the 4.408% of the evening.
Cuba: hundreds of power-resistant partisans flew out "Damen in Weiss"
On Thursday, some hundreds of Cuban-powered partisans have poured out the wifes of political prisoners who were gathered in Havana for the purpose of the day of human rights, and have renounced another announcement, which temporarily arrested a good dozen dissidents.
To the forty days in Weiss, wives, or close political prisoners, were exposed to the open road of the government's partisans under Raul Castro, just as they were on the foothill to the centre of the Haupstadt to demand the liberation of political prisoners, confirmed a journalist of the AFP.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "It's living fidel and raul!" scanned the empowered partisans with elevated faust against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil agents who had appeared to "provide their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Damen in Weiss" had taken place in Havana on the eve of the evening, where there was neither injured nor arrests.
In the Havann district of Vedado, however, a dozen dissidents, who also took place at the demonstration held on Thursday in view of the International Day of Human Rights, were temporarily arrested by civil policemen, confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents who were buried by the government under violence to enter civil vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As lawyers on the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Damen in Weiss" organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of the "please for the release of all political prisoners", whose number, according to Dissident List, has around 200 persons, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of the 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, from which 53 sit behind grids until date.
The Cuban authorities feel the opponents of the regime as "solder" or "agents" in the service of the declared archan enemy, the United States.
A rarity is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionary" on Thursday.
The Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused of European or American NGOs of disregarding rights and freedoms, especially those of freedom of opinion.
Funny kills eighty years with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
On Friday, an armed armed madman killed an eighty-year-old at the late afternoon for the main business time in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five other people.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty years of unclear cause in or before an pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives, and this, police statements according to the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a responsible officer of the Police syndicate Alliance in the hospital, is putting the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he chopped a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the thirsty, interfered and was injured.
The first two victims were severely injured into the hospital, where the eighty year old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life, as he, according to police sources, apparently affected vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in the "shock state".
The armed man who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police, should be escaped to the road, the similar Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have hurt two other passers, apparently randomly: a thirty-three and a forty-four-year-old, with the latter of both difficult.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives, which he wore crucified behind the back, explained on site Arnaud Pressé, a controller of the Syndikat Alliance of the Hauts-de-Sein area.
Several passers, including teenagers, are said to have tried to confine the mad ones according to the witness reports of the AFP.
I've seen a guy in the thirsties with a green vest.
Three youths tried to enter.
They didn't do it because the guy was well built, Alberto, a cellar of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke the wrist.
On the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the house number 61, two city policemen, including their supervisors, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knives, so police data.
The event has been played in one of the main hits of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passers came to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought them into first-aid opinion and noticed a clapping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later a second, about thirty-three-year-old person came injured by cutting wounds.
The police forces have finally arrested the man who has no ID papers with him.
The prosecutor of Nanterre has commissioned the Department of Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case declaration.
The mad one was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not exclude it from being brought into a nervous cure.
According to another police source, six police officers needed to confine him to the police committee in Clichy, where he had been deported.
He was "in a state of excitement" such as "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the Tathergang".
United States: Polanski's lawyer calls for renewal of law enforcement
The lawyer of the French-Polnian filmmaker Roman Polanski asked for the repeated time in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently at its place in Switzerland due to a moral disruption of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney of the director of the "Pianist", prejudged three judges of the Vocational Court in the second district of California in 1977.
I ask for criminal offence, explained M. Hummel before he added that the behaviour of the judge Laurence Rittenband commissioned at the time of the trial reads a cold run down his back.
According to him, the - now dead - judge Rittenband had discussed with a prosecutor who should have told him that Roman Polanski had earned breeding house, which represents a serious procedural error.
This discussion was posted in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), specifically by the inquiry lawyer David Wells.
Finally, at the end of September, M. Wells explained that the authors of the documentary film were "belogen".
If the Court of Justice refuses to initiate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel asks for the leadership of a process which would allow him to provide evidence of his argument.
On the other hand, the accusation has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the withdrawal of the stocks charged to the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director had fled from the USA in 1978, before proclaiming the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He hasn't traveled to the USA since that time.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had explained that Roman Polanski must be "in order to attend the trial".
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accuseds who are a way out of escape? Mrs Asayma asks.
They believe that "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and thus despises his authority".
One of the three judges – now having 90 days to announce their decision – even highlighted that "there were other cursing veneratives".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the termination of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, again demanded the withdrawal of the criminal proceedings.
She reminded that her client would no longer be intimidated by every revival of the Affaire Polanski and added: "Nobody in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Two and thirty years are enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind grids, he was then sentenced in expectation of a possible delivery to the house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is braked by the rise of the dollar and closed without course.
On Friday, the New York Stock Exchange concluded without a course in a market that was dropped between better indicators than in the USA and an increase in dollars: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has given 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"In fact, the market is quite quiet," said Mace Blicksilver by Marblehead Asset Management.
"He remains closely limited, the trade volume has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The tendency was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "have contributed to improving the market view to the solidarity of the recovery of the economy," the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months in succession and much more than planned.
Furthermore, US consumer confidence has improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes were inhibited by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level for two months compared to the euro, thus pushing down the sectors that are vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost some of the ground.
The bond market has declined.
On Wednesday evening, the yield of the Treasury borrowing increased by 3.540% compared to 3.482% over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Choice of the Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of travelling through South Africa, the 112 candidates will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to achieve their dream: to be elected to the most beautiful woman in the world and watch this before a billion TV.
During this great beauty fair, which is organised for the second time in succession in the neighborhood of Johannesburg, five of them have already taken their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were crowned for Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during her African stay.
This was a true bout of pleasure.
Beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn were just exceptional.
I've seen many things and made a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and is transferred live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, at 10:15 a.m.
I couldn't imagine a nicer country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russians, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovering of "atemberaubing landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, encounters with the press and Safari, the Miss now focuses on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as to follow Aishwarya Rai, which was elected in 1994 and were both Bollywoodstars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about the appearance.
We are an ambassador of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defile in traditional pursuits and not to forget, in the bathing suit.
The idea is presented by a TV moderator, the Chinesin Angela Chow, the ex-beauty king from South Africa, Michelle McLean and a responsible member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it has been wise to receive the world with a hardly surpassing warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, Chairman of Miss World.
The candidates have made a safari, like last year, a visit to the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted the bicycle and the local kitchen.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was very extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of State, Miss Sierra Leone observed.
Her most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the exploration in Cape Town (South West) to the football world championship in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm wrong with people I'm probably never going to approach elsewhere.
I'm sure I'll return to the 2010 World Championship, promised enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday are "very positive" according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news are very positive.
He is very strong, it's all very good, explained David Hallyday to the press when he left the plane, where he arrived from Paris shortly after 13 o'clock (21 o'clock MEZ).
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go "fast" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, which was delivered to Johnny Hallyday on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after surgery at a band disc incident in Paris on 26 November.
The singer was "set this night in Los Angeles into an artificial coma to relieve his strong pain and to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma which he was delivered in Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after a tape disc surgery on 26 November.
The singer had to resume an operation in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the injurious changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event in the French Gymnasium of Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade went to school, found a photographer of the AFP.
The Chief of the Department of Orthodox and traumatic surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the Los Angeles hospital.
The producer has severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had done the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were totally disappointed, said Mr. Camus.
I heard of the possibility of initiating a court proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has traveled much too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgery to Los Angeles".
I personally phoned with this doctor who assured me that he viewed this trip as totally unproblematic, which had surprised me very much, since I already had two band disk operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before he announced at RTL that the singer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the artist's environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Syn, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematomy after a brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with doubtful reputation, who has been sentenced several times due to failures and not to forget, because of tax impairment and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, attorney of the Board of Medicines, referred to him as "a man without scruble" who has to "regular" before the Board Board Board and is "everything other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday on his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This said that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "created no bleeding and therefore requires no drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have arisen since late summer, seems to be questioned.
It is obvious that it is too scarce for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus said.
The Party Alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre Party to no longer use its seal
On Friday, the party bundle, supervised by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, he heavily responded to a seal attempt, once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the chairman of the Party of Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and asked him, under threat of judicial persecution, not to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take this UDF seal, since he feels that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had given the left hand.
Moreover, the Minister of Defense, whose party partners are the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to stress his efforts, he received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC), who claimed the property of the UDF brand, since he first requested this brand at the Institute national de la propriété industrial in 2004.
However, the business office of the UDF party federation monitored by François Bayrous's friends broke the silence and made it clear that they were not dismissed and put the minister and the MEP, under threat of a judicial persecution, a deadline to no longer use this seal and transfer the property rights of the brand.
In the last days, you have made numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement to take the UDF seal+, the party bundle wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
They also believed that you would have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today's UDF+, on their political material and on the home page of your website.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this seal, the UDF business office explained and urges the NC party to "remove without prejudice the mention of the name UDF from all material and (her) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the ownership rights of the brand to its legal rightholders".
If you refuse this, we will appeal against you to respect the law and defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In her letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds us that Morin and his friends have "had made the choice" to leave this 2007 to establish a competitive movement, as it had already done in 2002 to set up the "UMP" party.
According to the signatories, the Nouveau Centre has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie français).
They continue to recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 has adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the business office continues, "when he requested the brand name, he has been no longer member of the UDF for three years, but of the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of the acronym UDF to carry out this for himself.
In addition, you give in mind that this lack of consideration is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC strategy: "It seems more dignified to us in politics as well as in life to make yourself a name instead of trying to get out of anonymousity by using a name that is not legally required in a fraudulent way."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploitation of weakness
The Court of Justice of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the Milliardary Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to swallow up some of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photographs, will have to rely on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the exploitation of weakness before court, a criminal offence which is a penalty of up to three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair worthy of the Saga one of the richest families in France in which mother and daughter are caught and at the same time have the tricks of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Criminal Board also arranged a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, jointly carried out by three doctors.
The heritage and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to investigate such an investigation, especially not under the conditions submitted during the investigations submitted by the prosecutor of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday should submit a report before 10 March 2010, in which you clearly state whether and at what time Liliane bed court may have found itself in a state of weakness.
I think she'll do these investigations.
I'm going to talk to her, said the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the Court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady who needs to be protected, he reaffirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artists, and accused him of exploiting the weakness of her mother for years in order to cut a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policy or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, which she sees as a long-standing friend.
Although the court should examine the admissibility of the complaint initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidoyers of the lawyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
For example, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she was wrong with the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her attorney, Liiliane Bettencourt added the following: "Please tell my daughter that for fifteen years, one to two times a day, I have written to Banier.
Françoise I have never been able to speak since her marriage."
The Nanterre State Prosecutor once again believes that the applicant had no right to react in such a way, especially because a prerogative judge has refused her request to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother in the last days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no form.
No one has the right to act in its place," confirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the process of the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager Revolution or the end of Strategic Early Disclosure?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing ...
Since more than a decade, the position of the administration of large companies in relation to its employees, the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It has been "values" for staff to depend the best as it had previously been designed on the consumer products of the technicians in the work.
By giving the customer in the center of the companies the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the local markets ... although the authoritarian temptation Products separately depends on the preferences of customers again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicide of France Telecom, PSA or Renault is only the top of a much larger phenomenon, which especially touches employees.
This demobilisation negatively affects the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of F&E and, more crucial, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) calls for "proactive approach and a future-oriented approach from all parties..."; it claims the employee's use which completely contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we ask for a business revolution which would be in order to place the employees in the centre of the company's concerns equally entitled to the customer.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion surveys
Will the internal opinion surveys, such as the questionnaire, which Orange has presented to its pay recipients, stimulate this revolution with regard to management practices?
I'm afraid, unfortunately not.
- First of all, because I could find that in view of a new situation, the whole structure has finally reached priority in doing what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of the power- proportional to the significance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Her interpretation of psychology is mechanical from the major engineering schools.
By intellectual comfort, they take over the old behaviorist theory that has recently been reactivated by the American "Neurowissenschaften" and unknowingly widespread by research institutes and by the media.
Thus and by suggesting that it is possible to commit the "Hebel" (sic) to the engagement of employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey published by Ipsos strengthens the leadership in a position to a mechanical control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, a business revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is to integrate a basic protocol in any reasoning or practice of control: for wage recipients, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve part of its dreams, ambitiousness and projects.
At present, the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of the motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their business on the basis of a specified doxa allowing them to assess what it offers to them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the leaders of the companies can control their "social performance", predict and precedure and place their Human Resource Management at the right place.
In this way they create a fertile soil that is beneficial for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "righteous war" brings Obama Lob from the right
The American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama in Oslo on Friday evening and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 defended the term "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who mocked the allocation of the price to Obama on October 9, applauded this time the President's speech, following the example of the former Vice-President Candidate at the elections of 2008 Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican party in the US Today daily and added that she even addressed the topic of a "many necessary" war in their so-called memoirs.
Of course, the war is the last one I think the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; a way to explain his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway", had felt this speech entirely historically.
The previous MEP, which is regarded as a possible candidate for the republic nomination of the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they were "not free and could not pay a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition to being a "cosmopolitan" as "he always does it," he said "speaking like an American president" when he pointed out that the Europeans were "living like in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and for their protection they do not do much," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a folk of the era Bush, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "long, high-third and inspirationless".
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is disturbing about how Barack Obama defends the attack on the forces.
If you pack the war under the judicial robe, you can justify the massacre to the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left remains praised by the President's side.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was prematurely awarded to Obama, referred the speech itself to a speaker like him known for his talent as "Monumentalwerk".
The speech in Oslo "provides a process plan to control international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," says the California daily.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and describes his speech as "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Remote drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the provision of Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the strike command and the threatening heavy supply gap at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "greeted the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated in the hope of signing the agreement quickly on the late morning.
And that although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had abandoned the meeting.
However, more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting passed at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was signed only at 6:00 p.m.
The conflict "had very much damage to the company" and "it was to be feared that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
Thus, the hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"This isn't very much, but we start small once," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now required to stop blocking the supply centres.
"There will probably always be some opposers who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
The Chairman of TLF Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was " difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros monthly for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on healthy human understanding and respect for employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "a acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs by 3 % and the maintenance of the total road transport activity in the first half of 2010, which will enable in particular to address the 13th month salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Busseau reminded that "the reduction of taxes for employers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the draft law of corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday to Friday at night.
The government demands "a identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies associated with this organisation and then to apply to the entire occupational status in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", assures Busseau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The Federation of FNTR proposed a "treacherous trade" because the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not to deceive the gans eaters on the near Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement is threatening "to create a large tomb to small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disorders this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest highway network in France for the large Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second strike day between the trade unions and the leadership of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration) continues to wait for strikes with their demands for wage supplements.
There were no trains on this important shopping weekend before Christmas between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central track (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central track was ready to use only one of four trains.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the travelers to move.
The Kaufhauskette Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP strives to connect the major businesses technically".
The line RER A passes the Paris Balling Area from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains to the main transport period went scheduledly, and nearly none during the poor time.
As was the case on Thursday, there was no human feeling on the track as the residents of the Île-de-France had turned on the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less overflowed than otherwise, especially because of the lack of gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), he had been extra "standing up a half hours earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, who had planned to care for travellers by officials and officials, pointed out that there had been no congestion at the Saint-Lazare train station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or driven over the Saint-Lazare train station to ensure the connection to the Metros there.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers took place again, while reviewing the results that the associations had classified after the meeting with the leadership tip on Friday afternoon as "three".
The RER Managing Director proposes to draw up a specific protocol for the RER A line in respect of all relevant aspects, working hours, career careers, etc.
However, that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-standing wage surcharge.
The CGT was insulted that the RATP itself puts their wage supplements in clamps and stressed that the leadership tip is "not able to solve a problem, while this was possible with the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP clarified that there was a new meeting for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows to the associations that the company "ignorates the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership tip that up to date rejected any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday the conflict threatened to extend to RER B line after an announcement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage surcharge from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). Moreover, they complain to deterioration of working conditions on this route where millions of travellers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, pay a gross wage from 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a wage surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish Party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision following the immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens the government's work, which seeks to reach the Kurdish Community's hands in order to put an end to the conflicts that have lasted for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved, since it became a "stage for activities that are disadvantaged for the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", says the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party's executives, including the Chairman Ahmet Türk and Parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the withdrawal of parliamentary immunity, which enjoy Turkish and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the goods of the party.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders expressed their views before the judgment, that Parliamentary representatives would prefer to leave Parliament rather than to sit as the partyless parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "Weisings" of the Kurdistan Labour Party (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as terrorist organisation.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures "no connection" to PKK, refuses to designate it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court of First Instance between the government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish Community and proposes a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to allow the support of the PKKs to be dismantled by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could result in a re-establishment of tensions in South East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan's detention conditions had led to collapse with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in the million town of Diyarbakir in the southeast, mostly populated by Kurden.
The order forces used tear gas granates and water werfs when the demonstrators began to throw Molotowcocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Turkey assumed that the decision of the Court "will further deepen despair".
"Turkey can't clarify this question (Kurdish, Anm. d. Redaction) on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party resulting from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose from principle against the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," says Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpeding of the democratic opening that was promoted by the government," says the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously focus on a PKK response," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced a attack three days earlier, which was one of the most brutal attacks in the past months.
The snow collapse can come
This is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants to do.
Not because he wants to shake the citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
In particular, its employees are able to try and dominate the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, it could be so far for the first time on the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is taking place in accordance with a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-roads with large-scale scattered vehicles will run off, explains Brauburger.
These include main roads and roadways such as the New Way and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire-fighting routes, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with casualties, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres should be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better liable.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "that the routes are free until the trade starts".
It'll be difficult if it's only cut at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because no one is willing to place the scatter vehicles."
Only afterwards, if it does not cut further, are shipment and concluding roads, including the Council-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's footvolk will become on the road, danger points and transitions.
The FES couldn't take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps in mind the bridges from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is on this fast sleeve, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-fressing dino saurers: the two-metre long and 1,50 meters-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with shekels and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the Supercontinent Pangäa on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaurs on a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as new kind.
During the excavation they carried together the remains of five individuals.
Fund confirms theory about Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional find: "Dino saurer fossils from the trias are extremely rare, mostly you can find only single pieces."
Other dinosaurs don't necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current study, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the ices were split into their three main development lines: the meat-fearing theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the Velocyraptor and also the birds known as "long hemes", the four-bone saropods and their relatives, and the plants eating ornithicia (bird cup saurers), among which, for example, the species of triceratops and stegosaurus belonged.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, as they also own the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also owned air bags and light construction knocks, the common ancestors of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs that have so far been known in South America, the researchers followed that the ices appeared there for the first time.
Accordingly, the three development lines split early and spread from South America over all parts of the earth, which at the time formed a single country mass as a supercontinent of Pangäa.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot descend from a common immigration ancestors, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science Study.
There are, of course, contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner Paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted picture because in South America just many primitive dino fossils have been preserved, while there is little to find on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptiles tribe to the dominant landwire animals of the earth's Middle Ages, it is still puzzled.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the air saurers and with many other ices.
Towards the end of the trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relatives died from the trias to the jura.
Success Story did not endure forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could hit the competition from the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact of a group of animals, which had also developed in the trias and since then a shade of it was freshened: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are lecturers from Naples, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The polishing of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University strikes waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarizing with the protesting students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written on German and English, they "missing" the police commissioned by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the educational strike last week because walls and artworks had been decorated.
Five students were injured.
The damages, the signatories judged, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events by students and teachers by a police command".
The remembrance represents a "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "deligitisation and crime of protest" and deviates from the content.
The Bureau dismissed the necessary discourse.
The lecturers demand the immediate termination of criminal persecution.
The majority of the occupants have not supported the damage, it says.
Protest legitimated
The youth of the union Verdi and the Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund also solidarize themselves with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi-Land's Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister for Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of UN President and police.
We are grateful to the President-in-Office.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden's country day.
We have understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to the CDU Landtagsabgeordnet Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions SPD, Green and Left saw it.
The CDU uses painted walls to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of addressing the arguments and demands of the students, they have been cleared.
The left has filed a request for the Interior Minister to report on police action.
New Silicon Valley
For many years she was considered a secret city, inaccessible for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded location for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had contacted the Frankfurter Wissenschaftsstandort Riedberg – with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed the planning descendant Edwin Schwarz for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ are allowed to take foot on the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian science companies want to generate orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planstadt" for armaments research.
Selenograd (laterally translated "Grünstadt") received his name from the forested hill countryside in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 can't be applied to high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply and simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the deepening of a train station, more than a monstrous construction project that will break down the city of the city of the city of the city of Baden-Worttemberg for a decade in healing building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be transportal fossils of the 19th century, which acted like brake clots of a modern rail transport, as it once took enormous time to turn locomotives from the back to the front.
Check-in, keep a short while, keep on driving - so it's supposed to go.
And that's why the headquarters should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit train station, located about halfway the trans-European railway magitra between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "Hart of Europe".
S21 is actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost unpaid to implement the low-depth in the hessian and the Bavarian capital.
However, headway stations have no more problems with entry and exit since there are modern turning trains with motor vehicles and motor vehicles at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now going on.
National and local politicians have endured it.
The railway is involved, even because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic of taxpayers and not of the State Group.
The project is still somewhat justified by urban planning.
It creates new urban space, which - believed to be the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit train station and the route expansion are intended for passenger transport, which - typically 80s - has been attributed to huge growth.
At that time there was not the competition of the cheap flyers.
However, modern transport policy must first be designed to strengthen freight transport, as transport on the rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by trucks on the road.
However, the new construction route does not depend on freight trains because of fierce slopes.
Even more serious is that S21 also tangates many other railway projects indirectly.
Approximately six billion euros are supposed to be budged in the Schwäbisch.
That's the official number.
Experts think 10 to 15 billion is realistic.
In the next decade, the money will be missing at other nodes and penetration in the network.
A total of sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 kilometers long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 it has been built on the road in time lupent.
Urgent would be necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake clamp.
The Rhine Valley is the bottleneck for international freight transport: in the middle of Europe.
Government examines judgment on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Landtag, the state government has left open whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400 pages of VGH original legally reviewed, said Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP).
On that day, the VGH in Kassel had writtenly found that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in the case of the construction of the planned North West Landebahn at Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as the national government stipulates, should not be compatible with the legal protection of the population against nightly noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized this repulsion and urged the government's representatives to refrain from revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD-Fraction Chief Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this would be "worm break".
It's damn difficult to keep his word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir, in response to the FDP waillogan "We keep word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, trying the government to come to their night flights with "justice twisting and trickery".
A precise legal examination takes its time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure dismissal, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group on the prohibition of night flights were never.
US banks pay back aids
The crises shattered US large banks strip off their state ties.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repaid the aid from the Bank Rescue Fund Tarp, totalling $45 billion (good € 30 billion).
According to a CNBC report, the Citigroup also plans to reimburse State aid.
The institutions thus seek to remedy the restrictions that have been accorded with the adoption of the money – for example, the limitation in the payment of manager bonusi and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had earned up to 19 billion dollars of fresh money for investors.
The rest of the sum took it out of its own checkout, which was, among other things, well filled by savings sales.
Bank Chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The spray has helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen at the centre of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also seeks to obtain money on the capital market for exemption from its liabilities to the State.
Even on Thursday, the US bank could announce an increase of about 20 billion dollars of capital, CNBC reported on circles.
A Citigroup spokesman didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aids.
Quick Choice
Everything went faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Management Board had forced the official Chief Friend, Nikolaus Brender, out of the office, the sender can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was the favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender - officially to prevent the procedure.
However, this proposal should not also have been achieved by the Board of Directors.
Frey, chess candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not yet established in the editorial conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, Schachter failed in the Board of Directors.
Only seven members spoke for brewers, seven voted against him. Brender's defeat was a defeat for shakers, but anticipated.
For the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already weeks before the election signaled not to confirm the brewers in office.
Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had organized resistance to the chief actor.
With the argument that under Brender, the ZDF's news broadcasts had been lost at set-up rates, he rejected another term of office of the highly viewed Chief Friend.
Until the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was torn.
Lastly, 35 national lawmakers had even interfered with the debate that evaluated Koch's approach as unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do with it.
For a person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romantics.
Afterwards, he worked at the South-West Radio and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "today-journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referendum of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin", until 2001 head of the ZDF external policy; since the head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio.
The Greens announced a constitutional ruling after the election of Brender, which was still elected on Wednesday by the industry magazine as journalist of the year.
Cook's counterpart in the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Polish Prime Minister Kurt Beck, stated last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the ZDF supervisory bodies also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a wise chess train - by severely criticizing the body immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both cheers without facial loss for the Chief actor's post and also the Board of Directors, without being suspected to take a party passor into office.
In the party arithmetics, Frey is now counted to the left liberals.
Study is disrupted
Partial success for the students: After a year of educational strike, the cultus ministers of the countries finally agreed on Thursday: During a meeting of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Conference, both sides agreed to want to improve the study conditions for Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module is intended to complete only with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students is to be reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable measure" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also seek to simplify the recognition of audit services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed to making common structural specifications for Bachelor and Master Grades more flexible.
There is no need for different national regulations.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, cultus ministers and university doctors carry the polluted word of better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council decided to partially reduce the number of tests: "Every module usually closes with only one test," says a 30-page paper, which is intended to regulate partially the authorisation of courses of studies.
With the "suppressive reduction of the test load," the Chairman of Accreditation Reinhold Grimm said, "the stopping of the foal development which significantly impaired the studyability."
In addition, the "Studability" will be the "decisive criterion" in design in the future.
Modules such as content are "strengthened to verify" whether "necessary constraints of students in the choice of
Events would be avoided.
Students would have "approval to receive playrooms, allowing and promoting their own initiative".
The rules for the authorisation of new but also for the review of existing courses should be applied.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it takes until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies under the accreditation council established by the countries are responsible for this.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had called on the countries "with strong emphasis" to influence the agencies in such a way that the filling of the substance is not too large and the testing regime is not too strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and high schools with the Ministry of State have already agreed on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz added additional resources to the development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, universities are aimed in particular to set up tutors programmes and to strengthen study consultancy as well as audit and foreign offices.
Country and universities want to spend ten million euros for this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a novel of the higher education law into Parliament.
After this, only one test should be required for the completion of a study model.
Study design is intended to be more flexible and to ensure recognition of performance at other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
By the end of the coming year, all courses of the country will be reviewed for their studyability.
Government and opposition had again argued about the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to commendation, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso High School Groups demanded that the formation of education policy should no longer take place "hinder closed doors" of ministers and university rectors in the future.
At least after the educational strikes, students should now also speak "a word."
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with which the HRK advised on a common reform paper.
The trade union education and science (GEW) did not go far enough the Bonner decisions as a whole: it demands a legal claim that allow every graduate with a Bachelor degree access to a further master course.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that today's generation of Bachelor Students will be able to provide adequate master study places with best possible study conditions, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The countries have to set up significantly more dozens.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their freedom to access the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Entry into Germany and out is pretty almost no control..." is the initial line of a poem of the lyrics of Werner Söllner, in which these in disturbing language practices discuss the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his speech room.
In 1951, Werner Söllner, born in Romanian banat, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher, before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded with various literature prizes, held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at the Goethe University in 1993, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessic Literature Forum at the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
He made considerable extraliterary attention last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, where "German literature in Romania in mirror and cerebral mirrors of their securitects" was concerned.
Söllner ignorantly and reluctantly read a statement in which he honoured to rumänisch German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Söllner received the German language prize in 1989 together with some of the attendants.
The procurement attempts had started slippingly, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, "so someone who hasn't resisted the intimidation attempts of the Securitate enough."
The Lyriker Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary confrontation with the dictatorial rule mechanisms, the literature scene and, in particular, the community of the German authors from Romania will be shaken by a case that identifies the disproportionates and destructiveness of a political system based on monitoring and emerging.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say according to previous knowledge, not only offenders but also victims.
In his securitate acts, IM Walter had played a role, said after the confession of the literary scientist Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter.
He "have cut him out" in all for him at that time, says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this note.
However, Söllner's statement was in the form and unexpected before this audience, totally surprising is not the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with Romanian secret service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for securitate spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July after reading her own record, 914 pages.
The affected people, one may suspect, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the deck name Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the very procedural vision of the Stasi acts in this country, it is still very diffuse to deal with the leaves of the Securitate Survey.
In recent years, systematic information has been deteriorated and disabled.
One of the Birthler’s members of the relevant National Council for the preparation of the Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, but since then the publishing of the documents has been more slipping.
Only since 2005 has there been a law that regulates the management of the files.
The fact that the influence of former securitate members in Romania is still very large, has proved an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate Chief from Temesvar was deceived about the winner of the prize.
She's got a psychosis, at last they've only been interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself here quite unprecedented in the form of freedom of opinion.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as often in connection with silent debt, is unavoidable.
Why not now? Who has been damaged? The senseful response of the listeners to Söllner's confession is hoping that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge urge rather than by debt allocation and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday took the Nobel Prize, it is more than one footnote.
Champions League saturation template
It seemed like a adrettly dressed outside minister from a very nice Christmas celebration, on which a sports goods manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross rose into a called C class, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the Equipment, a quarter hour after midnight. ̈
The man with the remarkable glacier got chauffed because of his other city.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol wasn't at last in the game, and sapped from luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
Was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work is just going on.
Or get out of here.
In the words of the only three days earlier Swiss committed: "We have reached the eight-final," in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be confused by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "very important task" is ahead on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the king's class performance in the League everyday life in Mainz.
And the weaknesses manifested again after the fast three gates by Marica (5th), Trush (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Exposure
The eight-eye finals of the Champions League (plays 16./17. + 23./24 February/Replays 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminant adversity of the Babbel successor continued to behave.
Not only the supposed healer who gave the insured Stuttgarter Profis in a short time self-confidence, willingness to use and joy of playing.
I went to the players and told them that they should think about their strengths, and have encouraged them to be more courageous, explaining the so easy-to-knocking success recipe that Babbel had no more effect under therapist.
He created a certain magic, admitted Babbel-professor Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in the football, sometimes happens things that could not be considered possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injuries due to his dynamics, renewed the best players on the place, tried to describe the "phenomena" detected with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the functioning of the new supervisor: "He is a man who strikes and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel, it had obviously beaten it.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns Sports Board Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs constanz in particular.
Like Gross, players and managers were also opposed to overevaluating the victory against a weak and totally overestimated defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening, Khedira gave consideration.
And sports board Horst Heldt warned that although a seasonal goal was achieved, the other was still farther.
We're not above the mountain yet.
The fact that hero was not celebrating on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory for three months, was the event of the weekend, which was freshly experiencing in the form of a TV interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann just before the beginning of the game.
There are decisions that make others and not the Jens, held the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had suggested the board of directors' weaknesses and decided to change the trainer's position on pressure of puber fans.
Also that his free day had been deleted after games, Lehmann appreciated as signs of lack of sovereignty and disapproval.
Lehmann's statements were "inherited by pure egoism", he hurled hero and announced consequences for the concluding man.
You're probably not going to be friends for life, the two forty years.
However, they agreed with all others that without the pre-works by the dissolved trainer team, the playful and fighting-strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share in the success," said Held and Lehmann unisono - and also the man with the plastic bags agreed.
WM-Fight in the Heavy Weight
Hot Duell in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko repeatedly provoked with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainer defended his heavyweight title according to WBC version.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box world champion in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old champion, according to the WBC version, defeated the US American Kevin Johnson unanimously by points in the night to Saturday in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainer was twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the K.o. who all expected did not work.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 victories in 41 professional struggles, twice he had to beat himself because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th struggle.
Around 17,000 viewers in the Berner Arena wanted to dictate the battle with its left leadership, especially 2,02 meters.
The eleven centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko-Ara before the Duell, but repeatedly refrained from the battles of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively into the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beats met the world champion only rarely.
After all, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had taken care of some spine before the battle in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "hussy zombie", who can't do anything right.
When weighing, the champion then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunbrille from the nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory for Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko was also victorious in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of expiry, he had hit the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and returned to "his" WBC belt, which he had had to give off.
This year he repressed at his title defense Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the USA.
I've only lost one blow in this fight and I'm physically very well in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is a world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
The belt of the WBA, however, is carried by the British David Haye, after he was able to dispose of the 2,13 meters large Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had previously forgotten a fight against Vitali Klitschko in the summer of September.
It is said that its promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green-Fraction Chief Jürgen Trittin has called the defence minister Guttenberg for false information on the Kunduz affair as a liar.
SPD and left demand information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the air attack by Kunduz, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor at Guttenberg (CSU) has undergone conscious deception.
The Minister said to the fatal bombing on two tank trucks of September "knowing the untruth," said Greenen-Fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news release "Tagesschau".
It's called the countryside: he lied.
The command to kill had been issued in ignorance of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that the NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it became known that the attack was not only a destruction of the kidnapped deceased, but also a targeted killing two Taliban leaders.
The US Air Attack requested by the German Kunduz Commander Oberst Klein was killed or injured by up to 142 people, according to the Nato investigation report.
Greene, SPD and left asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghanistan policy of the Federal Government - and whether Chancellorship, Federal Office and News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green Collegin Renate Künast requested.
Government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm decisively rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor Office had not influenced concrete interventions of the Federal Army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry on the background of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
Following information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have properly and fully informed the backgrounds of the tank loadr attack.
It was officially said that they would have denied the existence of the Nato reports and abstained from the minister's sensitive details.
However, from the environment of the two senior officials, they claimed that they had even pointed to the Ministry of Defence several reports, including a two-sided document of the commanding Chief Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert has now asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper".
He hasn't received an answer yet, it says.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not express its accusations and pointed out that this was clarified in the Inquiry Committee of the Bundestag, which wishes to make itself the next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see pictures in awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally sick and drug noise, the limits between imagination and reality vary.
As long as it happens in sleep, it's all right.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can give ourselves the most wild imaginations and imaginations.
But whoever experiences traumatic conditions in the wax, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is mostly considered crazy or druglike in the modern Western world, at least as a special.
However, such pictures and voices do not only arise in mentally sick or in drug noise.
Debt has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make sure that the limits between dream, mahn and reality are diminishing.
Dramaticly changed watch consciousness conditions can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case Wahn.
Even though triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystical Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, Shamanic deception conditions, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or moods arise when the balance of the neuronal bone substances of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disrupted and the interaction of various brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and mad thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no power over him anymore
The context of wahn and dream has been employed by philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
In 1861, Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in awake condition, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatrie, found a "great similarity of error with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud was the dream even "a psychosis, with all inconveniences, madnesses, sense disorders of such".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and silky.
The heavy force has no power over him, he sweves at the room ceiling.
He feels a suit.
Behind him swinged devil shapes with blood red, distorted fragments, teething.
They hunt him, step him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pains throughout the body.
Sound, malicious voices drown from walls and radio.
He can't bear them anymore, the voices that shame him and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo system, knocks them into a snail and attachs them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a loudspeaker and puts the snake around the neck.
Jumps.
The snake is loosening.
This should be a doctrine to you, shout the voices in drum-felling choir, "go into the clinic and heal you!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years ago, the first nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is shizoaffective paranoide psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he has been married.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deep despair, he says.
The misconceptions are horrible reality
Approximately one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in life, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, affected people can usually no longer distinguish between indoor and external worlds, they get into an overwhelmed state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Particularly widespread is voice listening - voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The data subject can no longer separate important things from insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and imaginations that originate deeper consciousness layers.
The realistic perception in psychosis is subject-centreed, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Doctor of the Clinic for General Psychiatry in the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The schizophrene is located in the center of the event, everything has a significance to it.
At the same time he enters into a passive role, he is overwhelmed by the events, like in the dream, and cannot make them active.
Schizophrene feels often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible to them, the misconceptions are horrible reality, waking out.
One time in life have experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but keep on maintaining the sensual and spatial structure of reality perceived in the psychosis in principle."
The mad thoughts and hallucinations foot in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain is beating capriols, researchers still pose mystery.
Exception conditions can lead to a short-term loss of reality in every person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic cause for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the sole factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damages in the case of those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed in an early stage of development, for example by a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But there is still a mystery about how the nervous system is disrupted, which is also not manifested at first over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis when the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The mad is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get what, says Lübecker Psychology professor Erich Box.
Whether misleading images are considered pleasant or unpleasant, often is just a question of viewpoint.
Box has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illuminations for ten years, last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The irreal world in our heads".
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying appearances of psychosis, but also of amazing many other diseases.
In addition to psychiatric disorders such as borderline or depression often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or alzheimer and skull brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to box, consist of memory content, which are normally retained.
They arise when brain areas where sense perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; if our brain runs hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause such a condition as brain damage or psychosis.
But also zipping, stress, grief or other mental exceptional conditions.
In recent studies up to one third of the respondents reported to have experienced hallucination at least once in life.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gymnasium there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a scary boy with long, dark hairs touches it.
If it answers him, the fellow students look surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spoiled daydream, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she's listening and seeing this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to herself.
It can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy? She sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other false images aren't real and disappear again.
At night the phenomena are most frightening
Often, the misconceptions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material because the teacher in her eyes and ears presents a new fellow student, while he explains mathematical equations for all others and visible on the table.
At night the phenomena are most frightening.
If she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is much too rare and much too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or dreams whether the pictures she see the fragments or the girl with the bleeding cutting wounds of arms and legs arise before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell her what they think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She's been the abitur last year and lives with her friend.
One year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also an artwork of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from rice pull, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says box.
I suppose the brain is then under-employed and is self-caring for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, as a girl, was afraid of other children, often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad was not her physical father since she could think.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult to distinguish those affected, such as Sarah K., misrepresentations and reality. "Every experience," says box, "is taking place in the brain, the reality is being formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to develop, so they work so real."
Even night dream images are considered to be a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrene, psychological health is able to recognize their misconceptions as irrelevant.
Therefore, box advises his patients to value hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too conscious world, imaginary experience is most pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creative - despair is also an artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid experience form, a special form of traumatically changed wake consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experiencer considers to be real and which he can't distinguish from wake condition afterwards.
Oneiroid consciousness occurs in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradicular patients who experience a motoric paralysis when they are fully conscious.
If a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example by persistent, total incapacity of movement, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with a own imaginary world that is detached from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
An intensive form of sensemaking and sense in an incomprehensible situation that enables us to do not undergo a loss of consciousness in our own designability.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zürcher Kunsthistoriker Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart collapse surgery with subsequent heart transplantation goes on travels for days, while his body is sentenced to motionlessness at the intensive station.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bedlaid, old man, on board a train senatorium, a robot guards over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under adligents that produce noise from blood.
If a Greek is dragged on the motorcycle in its homeland, surfing with its spider bed in the fern snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys differ fundamentally from every dream for Claussen.
Dream is another condition, he describes his experience.
On the other hand, the memories of mental journeys are very significant for me after years and in additional details.
More clearly and more intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience sprinkles the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug noise show how broken our inner figures of outer reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist says, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow collapse can come
Burda
Children should take over the publisher at the age of 27 years
The new publisher head Kalllen is an intermediate solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he said to the SPIEGEL.
Holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old said to the SPIEGEL.
We have carefully regulated the details of this.
The question, whether they are active in the company, is then raised.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
7500 employees cannot be introduced to their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company too.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he retired from the Executive Board from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kalllen has been a member of the Board of Directors of Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury sector, the responsibility for corporate assets came to it and after the elimination of Jürgen Todenhöfer also those for direct marketing, foreign, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publisher.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of callen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years," says Burda.
Holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, said Burda.
In view of the cases of fate and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies are not safe before the fall: "This was always the case with families that were infected by a capital hunt that had been completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never.
He had no world power dreams, says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with 'Time' in the worldliga, these shops have become too big.
Complete Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is just about body care.
In the spa area, located on the eighth floor, you will find among other renowned companies, such as Hedonai, who are responsible for hairing with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxing and for beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that produces through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner and at the same time have a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the Relax area for two hours, to put your own "beauty party" with eight friends on your legs and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, divided for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy to 12 rooms.
For example, for the cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrational areas.
The fitness studio also has this kind of devices, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a perfect personal training.
One starts a training unit by entering a personal password on a touch screen opposite the devices.
After that, you will show several videos how to perform your training units properly.
The head of the fitness studio assures that 15 minutes (including warming and exercising) are perfectly sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if you want to visit the hairdresser salon after you have trained your body, the Luis & Tachi company has a room in which treatments are offered for the resurgence of hair, glossy and health for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 22.00 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and that is why it is a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their festive clothes into our wardrobe.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has selected an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté, which can only be depreciated.
Endsa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electricity company Endsa, together with the city of Barcelona, created the "LIVE-Buro".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is to be developed to promote the electric car and to summarise opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to promote the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endsa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous community of Catalonia.
These activities include such activities that are related to energy and in particular to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative in which Endsa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the automotive sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied the Spanish automotive industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "a horizon of peace".
In presenting the economic report for 2009 by the government president, Zapatero once again reminded the government of the measures to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would have a panorama of neglect and locking some of our main production plants today," said the government president.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the automotive manufacturers to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the coincidence of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also reminded that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects from 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which, in turn, provided for investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended for the development of new models, as well as for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to boost demand, in response to plan 2000E, which are applied in cooperation with the autonomous communities and automotive manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows for an average reduction of 6% of the exhaust gases sold on the Spanish market, resulting in a "greaten growth" in authorisations , which rose by 40% in November.

Mazda3 i-stop: Environmental sports
Mazda wants to prove that sports is quite compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and drive system of the engine, baptized on the name i-stop, a device which is currently only available for the 2.0 gas engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 emerges from the overall image through its good notes.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its strategic behaviour, the mechanism, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seats, one can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good stop.
The game of the steering wheel is also excellent.
Further consideration of the unit consisting of the instrument board and the armature board can be found that Mazda is with a variety of buttons and switches in the spectacular colours red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of Honda Civic.
That is why it can be said that both Mazda 3 and Civic, both Japanese models, are deprived of the soberness of the German cars, especially of the Volkswagen Golf, which all wants to exceed.
The passenger space of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive by car too comfortable.
To all of this comes a large and clearly shaped suitcase room.
The stop and drive system is only available for the 2-liter gasoline engine with 150 PS and a 6-speed switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It highlights through its fineness, by its silent noise, its performance and by its low consumption.
And all those who do not travel many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in the switching and its low consumption, even if the diesel models are most sold in Mazda.
With regard to the equipment, the model Sportive is selected for the sampling, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the serial furnishing, in particular the driver's assistant (RVM) emphasizes that abolishes the dead angle, as well as the control elements for the traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as the chromed 17-inch flares.
Moreover, this version also includes as if it was not enough in equipment, the premium package, which contains for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learning-able bixenon lights and the sound system BOSE with CD chargers.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the diversity of equipment.
In addition, those who do not have many miles a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 PS.
The only negative aspect of this model is his slightly high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 euros for the sampling model sportive.
However, as a counterpart to this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day on the new highest passport.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red tepppich of the sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "pe", as elegant as always, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too limited, a device that allows you to read only its e-mails without a way to see some attachments or to browse through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
It is rather unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea in itself is of particular interest to young people.
In contrast to the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success, it has put two new devices on the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a life-long free service for data, in contrast to the peek, with which one has to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise parat.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 Euros a month, includes roaming for all Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone around the world already know what it means to refrain from all the data to read their emails as soon as you cross the border of the country or if you desperately seek a café with WIFI (or a connection with fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for abroad stays, but my experience already requires a doctoral title in physics and a good glass to read all the small printed ones.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission on affordable roaming rates for all Europe remained almost always unrespected.
Outside your own country, you are always afraid of reading your emails and rightly.
That a small device such as FonPeek (where it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it has no Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs, means that the phone providers need to think slowly but safely and start to consider different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example, in its prices it is included downloading books and further requests on the Internet.
Without carriage and without hooks.
This is an internet-fit device and you only pay for it one time, that is, when you buy it, and not month by month.
And that is exactly what I also expect from FonPeek one day to buy a possibility with lifelong internet access as it already offers in the USA.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I'm reading my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Even at Barack Obama's office as President of the USA, she appeared in a dress and a jacket of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him with his second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has wore very similar models on both occasions: over that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow - the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and jacket from the same fabric, and it wore somewhat largely embroidered or a necklace.
It is even so far that at the first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturia and had decided to wear the same dress with more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different in the type of fabric they are made from.
During the official introduction, she wore a dress of top and in Oslo of a carved seed.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-high paragraphs and for the second time a deaf model, but gold colors.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was tied up at this occasion as a hair crown, and the previous she wore her hair open.
75% of working mothers have suffered problems in work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially in younger women who want children.
This result is the study carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women "Fruitability and Career of Women in Spain".
The survey of 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of women working in the labour market see their career opportunities restricted because of their maternity.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to set up a family and the number of children depending on whether women work or not and if yes, what kind of profession they exercise.
Those of them who do not perform any other activity outside the house, only work half-days or have no fixed work contract, become mothers and have more children.
On the other hand, women with a fixed job, especially in the public sector, move the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed job will receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after the gathering, a number increasing to 4.1 years for women with a fixed job, who have used longer to achieve this, and who have gathered them and the first child have only realized much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a major influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar of reception", explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be identified in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only primary education or higher education, were an average of 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
Furthermore, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with the main graduates marry before their first festival and get their first child, it makes the women with a middle or high school degree exactly different and first seek a festival and then marry and then get their first child, Delgado finds it.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to his all-committed list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising word "Because you're worth it."
The main actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will become another famous hanging sign as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actors Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the case of men, the cosmetic company also has only exceptional messages: Patrick Dempsey ("Gray ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Preview College of Evangeline in "Lost").
The pricing of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual prize ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They all appeared to this occasion.
The ex model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen for the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Assess" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) to the three-size X-ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearful genre (curz biography, life and work) but seeks an anelytness to the glowing heartpiece of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent doesn't save any fears or enlightenments.
Apart from the fact that this book is a delicious reading, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some sections from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his sides, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual motivation, just as I always felt it without having found words: the joy in contrast to the unhealthy destiny, the morality without debt and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allgoric Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between ignorance and ignorance, with a tremendous poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was drawn by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, whose flesh in which the emotions, due to adultery, united themselves with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was to come into the heavens on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 in Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 summits in the world's literature, one must climb up on the north wall, on the wall where the best mountain climbers are constantly trying again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird coat.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the heritage of a property owner of the county and another time he said he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams bear witness to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the mad scream, which was screamed out of a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo went down to the night of the 20th century in his literary way. This he made during a journey on which he fled before himself and prayed for the offspring with a speech of violence before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knocked herself and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power, that I may finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "In his tomb these verses of Spencer are ingraved: ' sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the harbor,/ tranquillity after the war,/ after a sat life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying them between the Azalees or singing the birds on Greek.
There is no other case known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was still much more grey than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to invade Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not lead Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, besides destroying the glory of that man, so that he could stand himself on this podium?"
Fear aggression
My 70-year-old mother went through our part of town in Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people from 15 to 18 years of age flew next to her and our dog, our dog is a blend that we got from the animal home and weighed just six kilos, and then from the hot sky they missed him two walks and hurt him hard.
Our disarmament cannot be understood in words, as it is incomprehensible to us, since the passport should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which has, of course, been executed on the line.
The sufficiency attack that a woman who walked in a cozy way was given when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared her own life, for if such a mad man attacks a dog, he may be the same with a woman, a child, an older master, or even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred at five o'clock in a typically quiet district on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been healing all day.
Of course, we have advertised in a nearby police department, but we have great doubts whether this will bring anything and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the fig criminals were spans.
Our disarmament about the event has prompted us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what these young people have to do in their minds that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), the tyre manufacturer Michelin launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially in the younger motorcycles, as both companies today announced.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport security, which "complies far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure every day" and further confirmed that it also contributes with other actions of educational and informative nature to reach a step closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, running under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle plants in a first phase to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that transport security is "a constant concern" of the company, and especially for the reason that as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, it is always committed to the development of ever safer products to one of its main objectives.
The sale of small trucks increases a little again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in terms of 2008, and, much more important, they are the first growth at all after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
These good figures, however, are currently only with great caution, as the reference data used to compare from November 2008, which was a particularly bad year with a reduction of 60 % in the previous year.
However, it must be noted that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total allowances of these 11 months still are 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number, all vehicles consisting of the small transporter market are included: decompositions of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small suppliers and lighter small trucks.
Furthermore, the same thunder clouds in the sky are still the same, most affected by demand, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by individuals, the large proportion of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which, in almost 100% of all cases, are purchasing with a third-party financing.
For these restrictions, which are the consequence of the currencies of credit institutions, further factors must be included, such as the increase in unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, financial support has helped in buying a 2000E vehicle.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, but also for self-employed and small enterprises, if they want to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 extract that is not allowed to exceed 160 grams per mile per mile, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded us that it is essential for the state to take special attention to these small loads as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (last cars and buses).
For 2010, the car dealer association prophesies a year similar to that just past, for which it expects a sales loss (for passenger cars and terrain cars) of 19%.
Support for braking in critical situations is now required
As with the ABS anti-blocking brake system and as it is now happening with ESP stability control, the braking brake apparatus must become a mandatory equipment in the European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and small transporters, for the remaining vehicles a car park period has been set by the end of February 2011.
The European Union's decision aims to improve the protection of the drivers, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exercise more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake maneuver, which recognizes the system using the brake strength carried out by the driver on the brake pedal.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident no longer came to the brake pedal before the collapse, and half of them had not brake fully.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, however, takes up the brake system with maximum power and thus reduces the brake time and thus also the brake distance that a car relays during braking process.
According to a EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents that damage drivers could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would be even less accidents - one expects that one fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency brake systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects (by radar or camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time it already exercises a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system helps him to increase pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collapse is inevitable, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel work in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) was already informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8 April, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the side concerned will give its agreement in advance to each point of the plan.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which is first presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
By contrast, GM is assured that in the next days there will be a decision concerning the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car manufacturer so that it can make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which has back-up by the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever stronger support.
If no one of these buyers should have an agreement, GM may sell some assets to Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to remain.
On the control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewellery, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it easier to reach 80 kilos, bringing only 1,275 kilos on the scale now.
In order to create such a thing, they were the first to refrain from the automatic open-up roof, which was replaced by a tent sleeve with manual drive, so that alone they saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "dwindle away" further 15; by removing the air conditioning once more 13; further, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 litres, so another 7 kilos were saved; by the installation of sporty Bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19 inches again five.
Then the CDR-30 was again less than six kilograms due to the absence of the CDR-30 audio system and the lack of kilos was achieved by the exchange of door handles by handles from dust.
Although it is also available with the double coupling powered PDK, the sample drive was carried out with a 6-way vehicle, mainly on the smaller country routes of California, on mountain trails which really remained very curious.
With his driving behavior, you can only give him the note without a charge.
However, the reduction of his weight has not led to the fact that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
It's rather the opposite of the case: we haven't been at risk of such a small and light model since long, but at the same time there is also a feeling of great safety at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gang in the required time until we give him the commands to rake, brake, recover and then get back to the new everything out of his engine ...
He does everything you say to him. The car makes everything we mean to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as precise as well.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all flavors
The sound of its V6 Boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has been extremely successful, and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noises already used at Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginablely brutal, whether out of the standing or when it is accelerated again.
The feathers are strong but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the streets on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the pit holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and that, although we found some of these curves of ice in the morning gray and rolling fragment in the morning.
In summary, one can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an inscribable passport, as otherwise it may be rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will come to the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of Coco Cocoon Cocoon's cosmetic line and an occasional staret in the fashion views of 'Maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck starrity as her bags from Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia is a victory in Israel
Despite the many outstanding players in Dusko Ivanovic's team, the Caja Laboral celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after Mirza Teletovic's vast appearance, which was with eight three times the best of his team (29 at the review).
The team from Vitoria could replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of use and team work, even if they had to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated threefolds contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Reds, who sat up to the top of the ad board from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria came out of the perimeter, it was already known that they had come to the field with well warmed wrists.
They were English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was barely different, only that the team from Álava decided for an inner-sided game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received when returning to the team with pips and applause, which is his home to further expand its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" assessment of splitters already stated that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage of the break, the game has not yet been decided and the Makkabeans wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that on their field not everyone wins, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of Elías", they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed crucially to the "yellows" turning the row (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a few trains with meeting safety to get back air and with one of them suddenly came Mirza Teletovic's pistoles, which with three almost consecutive three times and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the display board again a calming distance of (54-67) was displayed, which the host could be beautiful with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alaves have been placed in the last quarter, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they would not allow anybody to take away the victory that they had earned honestly in the first three-minutes.
Nonetheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their team, and tried to give their team strength through three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splitters were put from place because of fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended himself well and even though the Israelis got up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being given the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take off the leadership in the group B of Euroliga in a game marked by the losses of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the inner game, which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which perhaps is one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive three times, two of them through Omar Cook and one through Guillem Rubio, the hosts blonde with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the one's Unicaja, even though the local team with an interior game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the display board in the 13th minute 22-20 for their benefit, the minute in which it had almost come to beat between the two Americans Beverley and Williams because of an action, and for which both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to finally warm and his superiority on both parts of the game, while the elimination of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-borne mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces of the Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with its threefolds, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A pickup hunt was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game performed in Málaga at 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn brought the leadership within the group into the variation.
Unicaja tried to avoid Robert Archibald's many losses and the outbreak of the shots injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came a little hope for 66-57 in the 31st minute thanks to the feather management and the threefolds of Cook and the use of Lewis.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, once he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to brake.
The Croatian captain Nicola Vujcic managed to increase the corb difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to be hit and had to resign the leadership of Olimpiacos.
How much should you earn in Facebook due to its profile?
Now, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most displays of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, the users can experience their salary due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users have a form available in Facebook where they can enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
After a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish employee is on the average "safely paid," explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a French $31,059, unlike the 24,000 euros that a Spanish man earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net value of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid work in Spain is the one of a cellars with an annual EUR 11.592 net; followed by the work of a seller with EUR 14.725 and that of a worker with EUR 15.667.
The most sought posts on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day offices and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date for leaving
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in their message in Tegucigalpa.
The President exposed from the Office shall leave the diplomatic representation no later than 27 January 2010 if his mandate expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegated to the Brazilian Embassy in the dogurian capital, confirmed TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he had found the message in which he had found asylum since September 21st.
"He is aware that he has to go on January 27th, since his mandate is running on this day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The sender also quoted the ex-president who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (who Porfirio Lobo became a winner) Zelaya assured that he would stay in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
However, this failed to recognize the status of a politician seeking asylum, whom the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to force him.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since spring, when the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood on the markets, the market has returned to uncertainty, which is in no case surprising, since this is its natural state, in an environment where the agents make decisions about a naturally unsafe future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly allow liquidity to be free of charge with interest rates moving around zero so that the banks can buy assets for calculating them.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as good as completed and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, begin to spread some sand into the gear as the BCE nac already pretended with its annual auction, the next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are just witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The reliability of the stock exchanges and the differences in the corporate bonus are increasing again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states saw themselves forced to state the private risks and the government debts rise again.
Now you rely on quality, and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences in the eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain hasn't been affected by this episode of instability until now, but then standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision downward regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm in order to silence the defenders of the moral risk, who had again tried to create a consciousness of what they had caused in the world economy policy, since they had breached the devastating effects to which the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs led, when they should actually have decided a new day for thanks.
Nonetheless, what has happened in Dubai suggests a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece has already been foreseen.
A government that avoids government debt, elections and a new government that draws at the same level.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It is no point that at the beginning of the year, Ecofin is rescuing Hungary from the non-compliance of its foreign payments and thus confers a euro country to stop fulfilling its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into the duty to maintain the stability of the public funds in the need for extraordinary measures.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excretions to too high amounts, that would now be within the expectation.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European corporate bonus.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish continued to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a Farce. While the preferred indicators here force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recreation and correct their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this promises no long lifetime despite warnings.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "prestige beim Fahren" is demanded.
Connected branches
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, appeared yesterday before the Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy on the energy supply of Spain is being debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the Chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few points on what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest 50 billion euros and 60 billion more from this date until 2030, with the prerequisite that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this was not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international allies.
As from 2020, the question will change and performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide absorbing facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the precautionary nature of other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "their long-term position is clearly on this direction, despite some of the "one" factors, as it called the Chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it as it is, says Galán, that, even if these are long-term investment decisions are to be made now, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to attack them.
Ferrovial gets the "Handling" from Aer Lingus to ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Iranian Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been published, is set up for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The Alliance plans investments from 20 million to 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate the energy efficiency of motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the authorisation of its first highway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
Its construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A 5 kilometres long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as construction companies and motorway operators.
The city administration wants to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the management of public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) decided to move the project forward according to a business plan set out by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll administration.
In expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to EUR 1.7 billion in Australia (1.047 billion), with three consortia, particularly European construction companies, competing in the last phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction firms, while the second with its headquarters in Italy is one of the best specialists for deep construction.
Against the team of Acciona, the Northern Direct Consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the closer election, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (daughter company of the German building company Hochtief, which is in turn ACP), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, specialized in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatisations, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as it is only possible to obtain access by buying a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by those companies high depth or bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish architectural giants.
Even ACP has gained access to this market only by 30% of its participation in high depth, the owner of the Leighton mentioned.
Millions of assets
Acciona is of the highest importance in this geographical area for the industry, where it is already well known because of its activity as energy suppliers and in the desalting industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind mill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that were commissioned to build and manage the deconsalcation plant of Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies in order to gain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground toll line supported by the Office for Infrastructure of the City of Brisbane and named Northern Link (Nord) has the purpose of connecting the Western motorway in Toowong with the surrounding road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnel. This is the largest measure for stauring on the streets of Brisbane.
The travel plan issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll line is already to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is assumed that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two tracks in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government participates in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million).
For high depth Brisbane is already a large business.
Australia is giving considerable orders to high depth, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million.
The ACP subcommittee will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre cables by means of its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create a fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet started and the high depth has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
Initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.2 kilometers long for a highway in Slovenia over the total of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after receiving the surcharge for the construction of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way alpine strengthens his experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the Sra Agency. Rushmore has a total of about three million euros annually, the railway company informed.
This contract also offers the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies who presented Sch to this competition written by Renfe, of which 4 came to the final round, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and production of the campaigns.
More than 63 million penalties for France Télécom for the outbreak of competition.
The Competition Regulatory Authority in France has imposed a penalty of more than 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers at the margin of the regulation.
Together with this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than 560 million euros of penalties since 1994 for the disability of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, since the Authority, who is watching the competition, feels that France Télécom has committed similar stumbling in the past and has therefore reversed.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened a application trading page on the Internet to increase revenue from businesses that do not touch the telephone connection.
In principle, this web site of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until this settlement will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League game has introduced Madrid and Barça millions since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League has developed itself in 1992 as a source of revenue for the Fuβball Club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, which brings them the third and fifth place of the Fuβball Clubs that most earned money in the League.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League brings not only glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the major associations.
According to the UEFA, the League has distributed up to 5.362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992-1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is the third place in Europe, which has earned most money through its participation and the only one next to the AC Milan who won the trophy three times.
The official Catalan master and final winner of the former European Cup in 1992 occupies the fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bavaria Munich, two teams who also took the most money through their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And that, though they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries that could take money through the champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, unlike four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This apparent objection is explained by the complicated granting procedure applied by the UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization, whose presidency is Michel Platini, expects to earn 1,090 million through the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 Fuβball Clubs who participated in the skill round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they competed, those who were fighting for a participation received 3.8 million through their blue presence.
There is also a bonus for winning (80,000 euros) and an unmistakable (40,000 euros per team). The clubs that have come into the eight-finals receive three million each; the four who have come into the quarter finals 3,3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, who receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club gets at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million fixed revenues.
With his victory at the European Supercup in August, Barça earned 2.5 million.
However, there are still variable payments for which 337.8 million are provided.
This money is awarded proportional to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first places and has 4 assigned places.
The master of last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third-party and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year's issue.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group made details about the purchase of shares by which it wants to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which, due to the number of shares, does not force it to make a public tender (opa).
In the Concrete, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share paid to ten years and with an interest rate of 1 % annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares concluded with EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18 % below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group of Jeréz gives the shareholders a period of 15 days to share their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had entered into contact with the Authority.
During a conclusion, the deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
At the same time, Sos continues to restructure his management.
When attempting to stay at the edge of possible purchase offers and the judicial crossings of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal accounting.
A decision that she becomes the first woman who has a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created post directly under the chairman of the group.
This is all but free from polemic because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of reversal of more than 230 million sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos moves further capital over the next months.
With regard to the loan of Salazar, the former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) held before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public procurement of Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion invitation submitted by the investment company Mer for Federico Paternina last October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this tender after having been proved that the conditions comply with the laws of law and thus the content of the Declaratory Declaration, following the amendments made last 2 December, could be considered "sufficient".
CNMV also notified that this offer aims at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which is 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6.142.786 euros in shares approved at the stock exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
Furthermore, it has been notified that 5,592,778 million shares have been established, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the conclusion of the invitation to tender and whose price was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws of law.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of storms and accidents, not only deserve the CFZ workshops
Every day, thousands of vehicles engaged in an accident are dragged into the workshops where an expert has to assess the damages caused and the cost of repair.
No accident is equal and the calculation of the costs of parts and hours of work can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the help of the latest computer tools, it is a question of minutes
Therefore, nearly 100 % of experts use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for review and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that the manufacturers provide is nothing but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, it is cooperated with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of which provides the information in a different format.
Moreover, the data to be processed is becoming increasingly larger, until the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been placed on the market than in the past fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes to the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a difficult task, because each individual of the Butthousand car parts must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold model, work can be completed in a week if the procedure is progressing rapidly.
If this is a less common car, it can last up to three or four months. Currently Audatex has 99.2% of cars distributed in Spain with complete information.
Among the more exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road-driving vehicle park, there are more than 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out the documentation and the production of databases, Audatex has eight worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually professionals for mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the preparation of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
This enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thereby offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country there are tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the failure or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of the used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to provide an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, while the star of the products is AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the experts.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
Except the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times or paint prices estimated by the manufacturer.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
It is most expensive for customers who rarely use it a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5,75 Euros per month.
On the other hand, each insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it was running from the mounting band alone using the vehicle number.
AudaGlass is working on the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the internet for the professional market, which can be offered for vehicles declared to be totally damaged.
Your statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or obtaining information about the deviations according to brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car trademark had to go to the workshop due to pans or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It operates among other Gt estimates, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.

Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a record foam on the Internet for the sale of accidental vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% in the next year.

This assessment and purchasing service applies exclusively to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scraps and car dealers who must be registered before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of which alone in Germany.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website today has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
Every day, 3,000 advertisements are managed and 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose wheel numbers have been registered may no longer drive on the roads, but it may be used as spare parts for certain un damaged parts.
However, the cars of historical value may be reappointed even if they have been registered after difficult authorities.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the tool Auda-Taller, the company ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, searching for the spare part, creating and creating a cost estimate.
The light handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,34 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 terrain cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the vehicle number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required replacement part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for the working hours, surcharges or discounts, and afterwards he can allow the cost estimate to be printed and passed on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for reviewing such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the working hours oriented to the workshop do not include estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 Euros a year, a amount that the customer can pay without delay.
The company Audatex is currently working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that has long been waiting for Automechanics, for example, because you can choose a door with it and then turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
