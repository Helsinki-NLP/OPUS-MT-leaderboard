Triumph of the jurisprudents in Austria, total they come to 29 percent
Following the first preliminary results, both parties of the previous large coalition and a significant strengthening of the legal poopist parties brought the preferred parliamentary elections in Austria from Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered particularly losses, where the position of former president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the chippe.
On the other hand, the elector of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is equipped for a triumphal return to federal policy.
According to the previous results, the Social Democrats (SPÖ) remain strongest in the country with 29.8% of the votes, but against the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5% of the votes.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian postwar history, and especially in the People's Party, which demanded the preferred elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had withdrawn from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear prize in front of the SPÖ.
However, the electors probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about a possible withdrawal of the party president and former Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party Board.
Such a development would probably make the way to the most likely way out of the decouple, i.e. a renewal of the large coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In the light of the strengthening of both legally populistic parties - the Freedom (FPÖ) received 18 percent, BZÖ eleven percent of the votes -, however, the Social Democrats expressed their fear that 1999 could repeat when the People's Party had agreed with the Populists (the FPÖ was then still unified, in 2005 it split itself from the GDP) with regard to a joint government, which had even resulted from sanctions from the European Union.
On this development, Jörg Haider, who has already explained that he is willing to cooperate with every party and is exercising from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the Green Party, which suffered slightly losses and abrushed among the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has probably mastered the four percentages and therefore did not go into Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it was not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused in India because of the illegal collection of bugs, the Czech Foreign Minister, Karel Schwarzenberg, considers that it could be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasised by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian official Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this does not clarify, surely, there is a certain cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the discussions that in judicial matters the executive could only be difficult to intervene.
In spite of all, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released by the charge and received a penalty of money, the central government wishes to go with the local government in Darjiling, in whose case the case falls.
"His problem could be resolved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of freedom penalty, Mukherdshi's view would be the best if he was going to appeal at a higher instance.
He could so request for release on guilt and, in freedom, wait for his judgment, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had spoken the same way in negotiations.
"He recommends a appeal at a higher court, then he would be gratifying," said Chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to allow the convicted "competent legal support" to be given, the Indian minister stated.
At the same time, he said that such help was already offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, the Czech press agency ČTK reaffirmed the Czech Republic with great importance to the issue of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
One answer to the question of whether he had received the commitment of the Indian side to deal with the matter was the Minister.
"I've already been promised a lot," he found only.
A Czech focuses on ringing around the sea ground
It comes to an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are portrayed.
However, it does not interest the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the adjacent marine ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-country teams of the UN Diison for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His boss, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, pursues the interpretation and complements it and then.
Workelan and enthusiasm are here.
The soil has been a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Here, oil can be found, the more inheritance and other non-engrowing raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, bear the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A sea ground larger than the mainland
The landmarks today reported their claim to the new sea areas.
After a UN Convention, they are using their rights to which they agreed in Montego Bay in 1982 on Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental Shelf, which often passes into the sea up to a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental Shelf.
"Simplifiedly expressed, as continental Shelf, the part of the soil and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent below the surface of the sea.
It exceeds the borders of the shore sea, often also the border of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental Shelf must be carried out by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation work.
"One of our tasks is to grant legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three latter countries have had success," adds Mikulka.
An international echo recently found the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its sea areas.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the sea floor approved by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that will result in the use of the soil in the future will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their requests.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Convention of Montego Bay".
There, where the continental Shelf ends, the area of the ocean soil begins, which is referred to by the convention as "common inheritance of humanity".
There's no other state here to have a special position.
The right to promote in this area provides an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor is not a golden grassland," says with some exaggeration director Mikulka and adds that "the individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former eastern block in the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it was received by the Convention, as well as by the investors of some fewer other countries, the status of a so-called "bahnbreaking investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Still Ocean between Mexico, Hawai and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than former Czechoslovakia.
The soil is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea ground.
"Fördern can be found on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich discovery of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
She reminds of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the sensible Shem, who has awakened the legend after the Golem.
German special forces were on site at hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the Geiserise - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
For the circumstances of liberation eleven kidnapped in Egypt European tourists, more and more details are known.
According to the Defense and Interior Ministry, German specialists were indirectly involved in the rescue action.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Federal Army and officials of the GSG 9 were the Flyer staffle of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal and logistics experts of the Technical Aid at the place of liberation.
However, as speakers of the ministries continued on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and flee when they had known signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by Germany to embrace them as local support forces.
"Happyly it has not come," said a spokesman of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers had taken the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions in the south of Egypt on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages were dragged down and down between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostage workers remained unclear, as well as the details of liberation or possible ransom payments.
The shelters have now arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages are in the obhut of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
There was no information at first in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to "Image" magazine, the five holidays and the special forces are to be flew out with an airbus of the Air Force and meet in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative House refuses rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has made the $700 billion heavy rescue package for the financial markets very shortly fail.
The Dow Jones got out in the depth.
With 206 votes to 227, the US Representative House rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme with which the chaos should be impeded on the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the advocates had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called the honourable Members for a consent, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones broke by more than six percent or by 600 points.
Reason was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure to become known, rejuvenated.
Experts now expect further heavy turbulences in the international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, the consent of both the House of Members and the Senate is necessary.
Organizers record rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel organizers:
In travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even more than 30 percent for winter season.
In spite of weak economic prospects, the desire of the Germans of a study remains untressed.
In the winter season bookings, rice offices recorded a turnover of 31 percent compared to the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the investigation by the GfK market research institute, there are already increased booking numbers for the autumn months.
Thus, the salesplus of the travel offices for October was about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV notified.
Based on these results are figures of the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and highly calculated for the overall market.
The travel bookings made by the end of August 2008 were included.
As a result of the weak dollar course, travel to the US was particularly demanded, the DRV notified.
Here the booking gain is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the local people are particularly demanded destinations for the Germans.
In particular, Pauschal trips are high in the course, said DRV President Klaus Laeple.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs "for customers are better calculable than for individually organized holidays".
Money could spare consumers, among other things, by early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laeple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that compared to the previous year, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased, although according to another study, compared to the previous year.
My First October Festival
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer made of litre-crows and promis in designer-directln.
A meadow debut.
Susanne Kron sugar and I really don't have much together.
She's blonde, television moderator and wears a tailored Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: Nearly three minutes on the grass, the photographers are falling on us and cutting the memory cards full - very flattery and that at my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The Billy Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the Whitewurstäquator, the well-being remained in line until date.
But once it comes to the Theresienwiese, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks infringed or embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Rare looks at the chocolan stand only reaps my dirdl belt.
A miner reminds me that I had wrongly bound the belt: "Left almost free, middle virgin, forgive right, wiped behind."
Homely, I'm wearing the loops from the back to the left.
"Pass," it spoke and laughed.
Others make less effort to subtle flirt techniques and wear simple filthy shoes on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist attractions is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the October festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "ooooo".
That's what he tells me after he unloaded his pre-drinking measure.
Just next to one of these hydrants, of which everyone thinks he's a trash.
So Bob is one of these infamous "wildbieslers".
Others do not have the luck to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, sanitaries run in crowds across the mainland which must take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the shelter - always wear four at once an overlooked wear from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn researchers: empty back, full back.
Whoever is in the promille sarg under the plane, you can't see.
"These are those, where goarnimmer packs," called one of the sanitaries on request and disappeared in the drum.
Name of accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female footganger who died in the hospital after she was driven by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, resident in Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the middle of the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspicion of easy riding.
Meanwhile, he was released on deposit.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey wanted to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in deeply penetrate the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial desires.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the guides tell you.
The building sits riders at the end of the railroad with a tower at every corner of the front and looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building breaks about
But once you are within the occupied ticket switch, there is no doubt about the excellence of the project whose western access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolien-Baddad Society.
Germany, who was a late in the imperialist game, had to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damascus, Bagdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist project took over during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence by Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, produced by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces came out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly decayed far from history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line, at least symbolic, serves as a gateway to anatolia and all east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tuxia.
The governing judiciary and development party, the ACP, has introduced a deliberately new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, produced by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approximation.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splitter groups of Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the cornerstones of this new foreign policy, I went to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about one and a half hours later, after a hollow ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is viewed as a new city, for the new worldly government projects, to return the osmanic past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has caused some of the feelings of distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the main business office of the ACP, a specially manufactured ultramodern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-completed shopping centers and kneipen in which middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost every other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to re-integrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from her homeland.
Nowadays, she must watch east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either the one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could sometime," I asked, "have been forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "will not have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point, which almost everyone I spoke with here, almost routinely dismissed: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the transmitted sense, Europe as a whole can drive on parallel railways eastward towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back to the Hydarpasha station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had been watching the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too widely, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the station on the ferry that should bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least there seemed to be no doubt about which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chor as "Tod" Handley (Receiver on September 11th).
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth chor, Proteus.
He was thought for young people up to 21 years, but when the choir sang last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) was for the willingness and ability of the chores to attack any music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young chores was often amazing, always exciting and alone, thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never read for years.
How often death held us "to let the music speak for ourselves."
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sings!"
His kind of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never curious, but never overwhelming.
Whatever the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had been beaten to the ridder, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonics.
Over the last 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I have never been disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, were simply going home with one or two well-known actresses in the world.
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your remark for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he reapproved the teaching of economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research stage in 1950 ... while he studied at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from a author note in Woodruff's book "From Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this period he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as the "British rubber industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and life' because its photographs are fantastic in black-white, documentary style.
They gave me attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the strength they radiate, how they always deal with respect for the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments."
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda starts marketing of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large-spacelimousine is still a much larger one.
This includes the technical furnaces that enable even more comfortable driving and petrol savings.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aestheticly, the new jazz has a similar line to his predecessor, the changes made in this largelimousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism are to be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analysing the new model, you need to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation was released on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the jazz was released on the market, a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Yet Honda tries to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars, which are 17% of the growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, which are 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to hide sales in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with total sales of 22 000 models, which are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda sets up the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while remaining shares are distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axis is 2.50 meters, which leads to assuming it has grown up to 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in the dimensions, the interior is also increased.
This success, on the one hand, is due to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, the central position of the fuel container, a solution that was also used in jazz's predecessor model.
The capacity of the suitcase room, which has a system of the double load area, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation bag room.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the doga jazz case room with a 1.2-liter benzine engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of building panoramic windows, there is an improved access to the seats.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and simultaneously provides torque powerful power for the whole engine running time.
The first variant of 1,2 litres achieves the power of 90 PS at 6 000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 PS during the previous generation, he now creates 100 PS.
Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Auto-Biene', which avoids collisions
In order to promote the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarming behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development center of Nissan Motor Co have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety sign.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee, which can see 300 degrees in all directions, allowing you to fly uninterruptedly in their personal airspace without interruption.
The technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF) to simulate the roundum perspective.
He notices obstacles which are in the distance of the BR23C up to two meters and are in the 180 degree radius, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a board-own microprocessor, which is translated directly into signal for avoiding the collision
`In the moment when obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately switch the direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The greatest difference to any other system is that this retirement maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project, explains.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, but can not overcrow; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to rotate his wheels and not in the infinite directions and in an infinite way as it makes the bees.
For this reason, Nissan used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and abbreviation functions so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
`This device needs only a few seconds to process the information and act according to these informations.
It does not require saving the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres done, so it can continuously work with just a couple of dozens of KB of space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the disk space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology to prophesy Nissan in the series cars in the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and keep longer than a variety of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite in order to lead to the target and avoid obstacles on the road.
She's worried before she's being stressed with a mortgage.
It must be realized that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to prevent US citizens from being involved in mortgage history of the allegedly affordable banks, a entertaining and informative game for the Internet surfer was developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the hotel of bad loans or the confusion.
The third aspect of this accommodation and specially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times, whether it's the moment to ask no credit.
And especially where you can do it, what probably is the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
This is rather a side for the teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) to their company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of their capital, a renewal due to a strong case of their exchange rate.
One week after a provisional agreement had been made public, the two banks explained that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley stamming shares at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total amount of $3 billion.
The accepted price is below 19% of the rate of the share of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will guarantee you a profit of 10% and can be sold again at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be operated on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley Act fell by 6.79% to $23.07 by 17.00 GMT.
`This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a Holdingbank', said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, allowing him to expand their businesses to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last days: Last Monday Morgan simply explained that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
`Before a week', said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, we thought that the participation would consist entirely of tribal shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% under its rate for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will proceed with a reduction of the profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares in one year if the latter are exchanged to more than 50% over the sale value within a given period, i.e. to approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds supplied by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, to strengthen their balance sheet and to increase their sales.
However, a group press speaker refused to make more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a rate of payment of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that since the end of August, his balance sheet was lowered.
The last weeks have been hard for the group who had to watch how their exchange rate decreased by half, while the price for insurance against incapacity was faster.
This price declined on Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, only more 'survival' of the large investment banks at Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchasing of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic refounded around the 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezolan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorian Rafael Correa.
That third one, following the example of his likeness and friends this Sunday, chose the plan of a new constitution.
Mission is accomplished, because according to the 80% of voters' public results, 64% voted with 'Ja' in the Volksabstimmung.
According to these results, 28% were voting with 'no', 7% were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order to adopt the Constitutional Project, one vote must be reached more than half of all votes delivered.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exits of the electoral locals and a statement of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for `Ja', and 63% to 70% prophesie time to him.
In the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had requested the victory of his Constitutional Project.
The 'constitution has triumphated in a tremendous way', he had congratulated the Equatorians in Guayaquil, the headquarters of the government 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean equator Michelle Bachelet.
The election held in breast-feeding in accordance with the Observatory of the Organization of the American States (OAS) referred to a text of 444 points for the protection of the 'new socialism' for which the President is engaged.
The Constitutional Project transmits state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives widely from oil promotion by foreign companies and foreign exchanges, sends immigrants to the country.
The project, which is driven forward by the Correa selected in 2006, also grants more comprehensive power to the Head of State, which will be able to perform up to two successive mandates of each four years, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13,9 million people living below the poverty line.
Finally, it also provides for banning the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an equatorian base as a starting point for American anti-drying operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commander launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, which had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, held in the desert for eleven days, were healthy this Monday afternoon and returned to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were liberated from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military support point al-Maza directly next to the International Airport of Cairo on board a special aircraft.
They were brought directly to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, on board a helicopter to be studied there.
They are enjoying all the 'best health' and the distributors have not been paid a ransom," said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the rolling field.
After being captured on 19 September at a terrain car Safari at the foot of the Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was brought to the nearest by 35 unknown kidnappers.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Agency of Aegyptus, organizers of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters, started the attack at night shortly before the dawn.
`On both sides, shots fell, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the remaining fleeing', said this controller who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian specialities had been sent in Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is right, about the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian specialized units have played.
`We must recognise that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and from the special units', he explained without further details.
He also argued that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a terrain vehicle at a patrouille, where the kidnappers were, of whom they killed six of them, including the leaders from the Chad, and two arrests.
The army explained that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfour, the movement of Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), however, which is about this movement immediately.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current election campaign.
That's better.
But a field of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise and proclaim the incredible sums that are given to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical places that devour?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no right laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides EUR 3.5 million alone for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours are written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all governments, in mutual votes.
In Quebec, in the association of the history societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 honourable officials who are gathered in 211 history so as to focus on history, to save the numerous private archives with a few greys, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the wax dogs of our cultural heritage that protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments stately parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial government, the Benelux States of the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank, which is armed by the U.S. financial crisis in turbulencies, are aimed at: The three countries are providing a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the Bank and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level during the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the representative of the European Commission's Competition Authority.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been lasting for one year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the bank could have a precedent character.
For the purposes of the decision taken on Sundaynight, all three states buy the shares of the bank at approximately 49 percent.
The Bank is likely to sell some of its shares, all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis have started a steep valley trip last week, and in the second half of the week, serious crisis scenarios have already occurred.
However, analyst agrees that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too large for a pledge.
The institution's securities fell by 12% to a 14-year thief on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares fell by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share rates, the group's market value is EUR 14 billion, which, according to management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, USD 700 billion is expensive American rescue package and the insecurity caused by this insecurity on the markets is due to the valley of Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses have slightly increased.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director-General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find an interest with a material offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor is supposed to scorn his money, it said.
Under the customers, no panic has been broken out, the bank's branches have not been disturbed.
In Hungary the Fortis has separate branches, but it also calls leasing companies her own.
Fuchs in the chickenstall
Due to the use of medication, a person often refuses to conclude a contract with a customer in America.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could be uncontrolled.
"There are data protection programs that connect the use of medication data in any case to the consent of the affected person.
These should be in independent hand, otherwise we trust the Fuchs the Hühner" - quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurances shall determine the fees and payment amounts in the case of damage depending on the health status of the customer, and should be estimated the risk too high, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the light of the investigation results.
Ten years ago Dick invented a far more favourable method: Based on the customer's identification number, he refers the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, speaks which preparations have been purchased, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering medications, it could be found that his blood fat levels are untreatable, which would automatically drive it into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the programme in the circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurers only need to do more to the paper crème, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as against migraine and heat walls, but also against depression.
The latter is, from the point of view of the insurer, a high risk factor, while the above mentioned does not.
For the query and processing of the data, own societies have formed which, before they collect the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do this by law, even though dismissals have not been imposed so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory examinations and combine them with the data on medication consumption. This gives them an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health condition.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a personal health data protection law, its effect is only subject to healthcare and insurance services.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress, which the authorities could also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard recognises that this is too low, so he wants to develop his programme so that the data can only be transmitted with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned may hardly deny access to its data, since the insurers otherwise do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are just somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After both the European Union and India are leading trading partners of each other, this was the main topic alongside other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today the French-Indian summit will also take place, mainly discussing cooperation in the nuclear sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an ascending, democratic power, which should be given more voices and codes in international matters, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhis in the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed yesterday at the ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and Chief Expert Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. A agreement was reached to double trade in the next five years, i.e. to EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing Civil Aviation Agreements with India were also legally summarized into an agreement, so that air transport will be aviated in the future.
By 2009, India intends to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the pact.
The aim is to create a balance in the unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number one India, New Delhi is only in line among EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
This was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which condemned both sides to the sharpest. The call for a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides debting the failure.
The EU stressed that it holds its energy and climate programme, i.e. the reduction of pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as did the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the coming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The increase in prices in food should also be combated, so both support the call for an international conference on financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped for orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's notifications, the agreement will be decided for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Starke presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the right purchase.
The international Frankfurt book fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the present event. They will distribute themselves over the 171.790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honourable guest of the event.
The secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm large exhibition room "Punto Italia".
A press conference near the Room Structure will follow in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives will be discussed around publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases in the entire but especially in adult and youth savings.
A year ago, the small aircraft of Milliardary Steve Fossett was found
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, which was found on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the desert of Nevada, was lost.
The single parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 metres, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the state of California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains were found.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully relieved the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located on which a troop was sent out. Now we have the security that it is the plane with which Steve Fosset fled on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the aircraft or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The American Office for Transport Security (Ntsb) noted that a team had been sent out for a few hours after the sight of the plane, which identified the machine: the Bellanca 8kcab was lost on September 3, 2007 after Fossett in Yerington in Nevada started a 3-hour flight.
Yesterday, some of the personal objects of Fossett were found in California, near the border of Nevada, from a couple near her house at the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two texts with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionary had conquered a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he succeeded in the sixth run, as the first man to turn around the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew the world in a single flight without an intermediate landing with a plane.
Among its several records is also a 15445 metres high flight over the Andes, but this with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv falling from the conventional schemas through its original design and the special line guide, the exhaustive surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offroader to breathe the sector.
Just because of its exceptional properties, the idea of Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort that will be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping miles of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give a special look to the whole: the new Suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear to come out of the poster on which it is portrayed.
At different moments, with the Elumina8 technology of the new Glk in all its details is illuminated in order to reconcile it as a whole.
It is no doubt that Mercedes's concern with this advertisement is to introduce a new type of author clause into this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in desiring the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who are the Italian hooligans
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of all Italy? They are part of the grouping "Ultras Italia", which has been travelling after years of the Italian national team and, honestly, they have not caused serious problems until recently.
There were never conflicts with opposing fans until now.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The suppliers come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
There were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia in Sofia.
They wear the Tricolori, on which the cities of the soldiers appear: however, they were away on Saturday to avoid identification.
Your examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a collapse with a truly legally radical fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had made the Italian fans 144 cards available for the game: all were exhibited on name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: no one was under a current stage ban on the trip to Sofia.
Four fans of the Italian team, which had already been charged in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to introduce further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a Stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stages throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put one foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitationists, which could follow little more than 150.
"This fire must be triggered immediately, and that does not give such a behavior the possibility to justify," says the Viminal.
That's why, "a look at the game of the National Team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Because actually there is a small core of Italian ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (port oversight) gathers the Casms on Tuesday, which can count on a part of the aise, i.e. the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce call and the raised right arm during the hymne of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (now expressed in no joy), which has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where there is now a core of the supporters of the ultras Italia founded in 2002.
Although it is true, Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, the behaviour of these 150-200 people was undoubtedly a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – adds No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are succumbed in their country of action.
So far, this group had been in the triumph, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the pigeons during the Hymne Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but let me, but there is no education...".
