Food debt to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area are the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro area, the inflation was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was registered, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have passed from only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
Unlike American, British and Canadian notesbank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the Leitzsins. According to its assessment, the reduction in interest would favour the rise in raw materials prices and the slightly decrease in unemployment to the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB is striving to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the drift mill: the inflation needs to be "compensed" to exclude subsequent action needs.
With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a 12-year record height in November; in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Responsible for the increase in inflation in the euro area are the increased food and energy prices.
The MATIF variations increased by 88 percent, and the course for soybeans has also reached a record height since 1973.
There was also a significant degradation in food oil and milk products in 2007.
The world market price for raw oil increased by 52 percent this year - last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached almost US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but in 2009 it is expected to decrease to 1.9 percent.
For the next 3-4 months analysts are from a 3-percentage inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008 experts expect the ECB to reduce interest twice.
Gallup orders government crisis
After long stagnations, the number of fidesz sympathisants has grown considerably by the beginning of December. First time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while according to Gallup, the agreement for the socialists has reached a still never-current depth of 13 percent.
For the party-faith electors, the difference is clear due to the high determination of opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 percent) are against a fifth (20 percent) consent for MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are, according to survey, under the parliamentary entrance barrier: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party selectors has grown by a percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic mood has continued to deteriorate – never before, the share of those who judge the country's economic situation as "excellently bad" was so high (41 percent), while further 46 percent consider them "thin bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change of their financial situation more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth is an improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December revealed that 71% of the respondents - a historical high - judged the Prime Minister's work as "formerly bad than right".
Thirty percent of the respondents have great trust or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán represents 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the Head of Government at all, compared with 27% distrust against the Chief of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think that the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be managed even without a change of government.
After the turmoil last October, 35% had been expressed for the government and the head of the government, this share is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the Volksabstimmung, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with security", and another 20% would "probably" give their vote.
In comparison, the parliamentary elections would take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would "with security" go to the ears, another 15% consider their participation "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the vote would be predictable.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily fee.
Concerned to the group of participants in the "with security" vote, the proportions of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, and 89 percent.
The most expensive, Tesco also increased by almost one-fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörsen trade area also continued this year the average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Trade Triangle, the price of the usual Christmas Corbe of the Napi also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF were registered in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets have been "galoped" last December, the degradation has not been dramatically decayed, compared with the very high, previous level of origin.
However, it certainly disgusting consumers that this year, for which they had paid far below 9.000 HUF, is not even available for 10,000 HUF.
The price of the "Napi" cart exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the market studied.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at previous year's level, however, strongly increased the prices for peanut breastfilets, Nuss and Mohn.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were also 1kg bread wake for 139 Forint.
There was no competition-related price rate of less than 200 Forint in the product.
Also surprising here was the price of a two litres of Coca-Cola pepper of less than 200 Forint, so the drink including pedestal only cost 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" comparison of carts also the most expensive, and Cora the most affordable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's prices in the "Napi" cart compared to Christmas prices last year increased by 15, while Tesco and Alsoan increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of today's year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of last year and the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase was still 1.206.00 Forint in the previous year, but the VAT increase was noticeable at last Christmas prices.
This is exactly what trade has been arguing: it seems that the houses of goods were not able to decide the price margin they should apply in the individual articles, as the effects of price increases on consumer behaviour were inappropriate.
(If the dealer does not plan the speed of a product, it may fall for essential profits in the price margin which is based on the transport intensity.)
Mehvalue tax-conditioned was the degradation of the "Napi" cart last year so radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was just 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost by 1,630,00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest, there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared with the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase showed, the price of daily consumption items in the hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(In turn, the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary are not necessarily confirmed: in some basic food, the Statistical Office has established a more than 30% reduction over the period of 12 months.
For example, in addition to flour, also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has rose by little more than 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they could turn the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets are not complaining; it is reported in good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses no longer look at the prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, durable foods go into pallets over the shop table.
Wednesday morning in the morning, there were endless snakes in all three warehouses at the cassa, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to the researchers that they could not even achieve the planned sales, not only in foods but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are stored
More than a thousand infections were recorded in hospitals due to inadequate treatment with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overlay of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not tolerable to the invasion of infections, the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places, the disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of the János Hospital, a MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a severe accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was a similar infection here.
The injury of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important surgery has not been performed since then because of the bacterium still in the patient's body.
Until December 10, this year, in hospitals 1094, multi-resistant infections were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Börcz.
So so many infections caused by multi-resistant infections were safely registered in hospitals, but the dark count is probably higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, which resistant to methicillin-oxacillin Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium bears about one third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as neck inflammation, mandular inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) usually react well to antibiotics, they are well healable.
However, if the resources are too high dosed or inappropriately used, the well-reacting bacteria antibiotic resistant, which are rapidly spreading in hospitals under the appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poor immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. Sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the daily sickness.
If the infection is not allowed to be confused with epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is only not there where it is not searched.
Resistance against antibiotics
"All patients are being isolated, the nursing person wears rubber gloves and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are studied at MRSA during their hospital delivery, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling withdrawals too rare
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances would be inappropriate for the invasion of the origin or spread of the multiresistant erreger, says Karolina Börcz.
After this infection is predominantly occurring in hospitals and old-age homes, the hospitals should examine the patients delivered and immediately isolate MRSA-infected.
In the Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sample withdrawal is not so often practiced.
Not least because there are no grants for this investigation on the part of the State Health Cash.
Most cases, therefore, would only be noticeable if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
On the side of the European Union, there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and disease images in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological investigations are necessary so that there is no resistance to the medicine, but this directive of hospitals is not always observed.
Among the ambulants, or patients in the basic supply, microbiological samples are even more rare, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Secured in the disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is transferred from one patient to the other most frequently by the nursing person.
This is why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transferred by drummer infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patients in the home hospitals.
The rooms are often overfilled, the beds are ranked close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters from the epidemiological point of view between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the less-favoured hospitals, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that just favour the development of infections.
Such infections are proved to be far less frequent there, or the further spread of the organism can be stopped where these protection measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
To control MRSA infections causes health insurance enormous costs, so they are fighted everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its inclusion in the government programme, was held.
After the first signs, the program is successful - as publicised data proves, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the emergence of multiresistant pathogens (including MRSA) as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Death-lenker Police Chief was not drunk
In the case of the car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor drug influenced, said Attila Morvai, the press speaker of the Budapest Supreme State Attorney on Friday after the official opinion was submitted to the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he was taxed.
The former police chief bog with his own car in the XXII district into the Kossuth Lajos street and has crossed a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked place.
(Laughter StVO, however, this is not a milder circumstance - the steer has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the cebra strips, disadvantage.)
The pedestrian is injured after his submission to the hospital.
According to police reports, the steward suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Prosecutor has initiated its investigations into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three credit agreements in Budapest on Friday in total of EUR 400 million. Money is intended to flow into education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy economy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by grants from the Cohesion Fund. The credit agreement was signed over 100 million earlier, and the current agreement concerns the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be used to finance the budgetary financing of educational projects.
A total of EUR 300 million has been granted for this purpose for Hungary and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the framework of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow in research and development programmes at Debrecen University.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also spoken.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications are rediscovered.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loans are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with an 8-year suspension, free of provision.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate palace
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all over Europe looks at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who still buys the cheapest market in the EU, but it becomes fast more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently no doubt the most popular patch for real estate purchases in the eastern European area, with cheap ski apartments and sea houses.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, at the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Messebar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly demanding.
According to reviews by Re/Max Analysten in Bulgaria, the interior of the country was also attracted by investors earlier or later, for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the most affordable area of Russians represents more buyers.
The capital of Sofia also offers lucrative offers - commercial and office areas offer highest yields.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, thus attracting tourists in addition to summer and winter seasons in the other two seasons.
Foreseen investors are therefore already buying in large styles, for example around Bansko.
Analysts say that people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their course of life.
Most of the buyers are English, but there are also stakeholders from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to leave themselves buy either revitalized real estate by €50-100,000, or descended houses by €5-15,000, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication options are largely written, but also the proximity to a large city, business and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed in December under the Top Ten holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group represents businesses that invest in the objective of medium- to long-term increases in value.
Real estate in the capital, however, is constantly more expensive, conditioned by the ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but over the last five years there has been an increase of 21 percent annually.
The increase in real estate prices is much higher than the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Minister of Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the experts meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the Ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on the Bali's driving plan, which sets the emissions reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
At present, a strong debate between industrial and developing countries is being launched.
The US has already signalled that they do not want to negotiate on specific figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrial states are willing to support the developing countries, both financially and technologically, in addition to the reduction of emissions.
A agreement on support for developing countries has also been reached.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is intended to be managed by a 16-country Council, expected at the Global Environment Facility (GEF) of the UN, as can be read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of the Environment, Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that by 2020 the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (rated by the values of 1990), regardless of whether the 2012 agreement is successful, or not. The Union would even be willing to use for a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrial states in the world, or developing countries are also willing to fulfil their obligations by force and responsible.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the aim of the States that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, while the EU had already committed itself to 8% of its 15 Member States at that time.
The standard for Hungary is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a standard which will fully meet the country as to be read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The use of Bali is high - the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly only take effect after 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a renewed international emission reduction system, which also highlighted the IPCC, the international novel price of the UN's scientific climate change committee in its recent report.
This would delay emissions reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irrparable consequences.
British Army Wires on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings on operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan for increased popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan since March 2006 have loaded videos on the network against the Taliban operations, reports the BBC.
The cameras rotated with helmets are controlled at the candahar Aviation Support Point and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message unavoidable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace teams (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve to inform the population about the actual goals of foreign revenue.
Such propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, according to the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message as they confirm the existence of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
Advertise Americans with game
However, the army also has to fight amateur photographs that, besides the carefully processed, censored recordings, also create into the network - such as those who show the death of the soldiers: In the something hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, it is spoken of the losses highest, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, many videos that have been rotated in use were already loaded on the platform from the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but these "goods" have recently discovered the British for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise on a different way, namely with the freely downloadable shooting game "American Army", where the player can pour into the soldier's skin in a more or less lifeful simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
The Minister of Labour, Monthika Lamperth, is not clever: Instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a working conference that enables her employees to enjoy the year 2007 with coffee and pogats.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other magnificent Christmas feelings with Tombola or attacks in the official hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministries is held in the defense reserve, but the staff of the Ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christian celebration of the orphans" children are donated by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The Resort provides about 25 million for the celebrations.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport, in comparison with other residers, are discussing the currents.
The 4.32 million Forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of celebrities is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a tombola loss.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint Christmas festival on Wednesday in the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a festival.
The hall rental was 1 million Forint, the rest was issued for the more than 400 guests loaded.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited at another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the competent authorities.
What the suit?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia ball on December 7 instead of a Christmas celebration.
They did not have to pay rentals to the OIT for the use of the rooms.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivals were opened with a speech from the Minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
On request of [origo], it was said that there was no ball dress or attraction obligation on the ball.
The Ministrys of Health, Work and Self-administration are preparing for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for employees in their own four walls for about 400.000 Forint.
Minister of Labour Monthika Lamperth officially invites her employees not even to a Christmas celebration, but to the conference on the year-out.
One expects about 180 guests who, so the press department, are only preserved with coffee and pocket, so the celebration is with 350,000 forint.
Self-administry Minister Gordon Bajnai will simply attack with his colleagues in the Aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was measured by 2,500 Forint per head - around this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent attacks.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the PM's employees celebrate in this way each year.
However, there will not be a proper party stimulation - not only because of the official speech of the Minister, but also because the celebration was held for the afternoon.
On 20 January, the Ministry of Agriculture invites a new year's reception, the Christmas celebration of the Ministry this time.
The one hundred guests are asked to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenses are measured with 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple steaming to which only foreign diplomats are charged in Hungary.
The receipts organised each year start traditionally with a brief speech from the Minister and sound with reluctant smuggles.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will not be a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or at the Ministry of Education.
Inquired of the cost of Christmas, no information was provided at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the festival held in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for Giant Strike
The Liga unions and the Hungarian union Federation form their coordination committee for the strike that starts on Monday indefinitely.
On Saturday, a mass of protests will be held, on Monday - on the day of the Volksabstimmung zum Krankenversicherungsgesetz - the work defeat begins.
It is expected to include strike-related, significant traffic disabilities, as rail transport is almost totally terminated, as well as the Budapest public transport operations (BKV) stretch up to 13 o'clock.
Details about the strike on Monday will be shared by the Liga trade unions and the union Federation on Friday afternoon.
It is also set up a LIGA - MOSZ Strike Committee responsible for the coordination of the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large majority meeting will be held, and from Monday on Monday, all organisations who have joined the strike lay down the work for an indefinite time, provided that no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike starting on the day of Parliament's agreement on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the health insurance law, the trade unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees shall meet in order to discuss the further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that it will be only in the late evenings or even at midnight for the vote on the health insurance law.
The strikes that start on Monday will have to be expected of significant traffic disabilities: the railways will put their work down for an indefinite time, the majority of public transport and more than half of Volán companies will be still in the morning.
At the same time, there will be a highway lock in many places.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations announced strikes at an indefinite time, others plan a temporary destruction of jobs.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement on sufficient services between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the Railways VDSZSZ, although more and more people are travelling with the train just around Christmas.
According to previous reports, the BKV will be streaked at the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m. and the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy will cover the work for four hours, and the teachers' work, bwz., the Democratic Teacher Work has called for two or 2-8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors strikes alternately at different times across the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of the employees in the health and social sector, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of Trade unions, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the Liga is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from the next year.
Claim 3 is that the demanded professional groups of access to the early boarding system will be allowed before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ belonging to the Liga trade unions did not accept the offer provided by the Ministry of Transport and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Garde increases State Risk
According to the Department of Risk Analysis (Risk Analysis Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Garde, founded in this August, have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects with the support of the "Moving for a Better Hungary".
The Institute's Risico Warning Report says, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Garde, the highest political risk represents the "destructiveness of the existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Cypriot population in Hungary which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Garde, which is likely to target the provocation of such a conflict, says the Research Institute.
As reported, this is considered to be a failure by politically responsible parties: "People of public life have left the discussion of Roma question representatives of radical political groups which have now developed their political strategy on the Roma Hungarian approach".
It is assumed that this would intensify the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the probability of violent disputes.
The research institute also thinks that the activities of the Hungarian garde, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the sides of the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad significantly damages, in particular as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been continuously in the upturn, so that several "national self-defense associations" have been founded since summer 2007.
"These groups are common to define themselves as a civil organization, while they openly pride their members to prepare for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (catastrophic protection, defense of the country, order protection), calling for the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And furthermore, this is all done according to that method that tries to tarnish various political efforts as a bourgeois initiative based on the political and party destruction of the population.
So the emphasis on civil character and the form of association is not merely the reversal of legal barriers that could appear in court in the course of the registration - it is at the same time a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activities of the Hungarian garde are a risk-risk factor for relations with the neighbouring countries.
"In the last few months the Hungarian garde has been quoted as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring states, as some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy in the development of the Hungarian Garde.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the founding of the Hungarian garde is not a single phenomenon in Central East Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Garde are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose founding was announced in August 2007 by the Federal Republic of Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the development of the Bulgarian garde, the Roma mass excretions took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as a result of the founding of the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organisation of "national protection" was.
In her opinion, for the last 17 years, a genuine "Zigeunerterror" was felt in Bulgaria, but the state remained indifferent and indifferent - so Political Capital.
And furthermore, the initiative had taken place in the Bulgarian public a severe debate.
As said, the increased risk for ethnic disputes is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to build their own gard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Garde have so far demonstrated many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also respond to the threats with the organisation of their own protection, it is said in the Political Capital risk warning report.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said on request by the News Office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and should be recognised as risk-changed trends, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere
In Hungary, celebrations are precisely regulated, so that the practice of changing working days has now been established around the holidays, but the coming year gives us less such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood as "feeting day".
The Hungarian legal system differs between public holidays and working-free days.
Work-free days are usually church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: Both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working-free days - the last one is able to rest alone with the Silvester celebrations.
Over the year we have fourteen holidays.
The public celebration is the 15th March, which reminds of the 1848 revolution, and the 23th October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the founding of the State, celebrated on May 1st, on November 1 and 2th, we remember our dead.
In addition, there are always two holidays to Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on one weekend, the practice of the "workday shift" has proved in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be completed, the Minister of Labour has been set up in a Regulation for a long time.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public staff and public service officials.
Except only companies and institutions where the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on holidays.
Today, the work order will only be collapsed by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life remains formal in this country, since most of the days between Christmas and Silvester time balance, or take the holiday that has been revoked for it.
In the next year, more holidays fall in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be less disconnections on the working days than this year.
The calendar is first put on the head around the day of work, so that people can stay at home at the same time as four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a rest day.
The second recast is related to the holiday on October 23th: On Saturday, October 18th, you will have to finish on Friday 24th.
The end of the year, however, will remain in the sign of the holidays after everything is lying and standing from 24 December, even if Silvester falls to a Wednesday.
Six disgusting minorities to anger workmates
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never get - harmless lies that don't notice us at all: they bring "color" to the everyday workplace.
The question is whether you are accustomed to these small inconveniences, or if you are better faced with the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstood, consciously for other angry situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department," says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, one regrets it and trys to make it good again by perhaps calling on the marketing department and reverently confessing that one would have forgotten to set up the message (this is the less common method).
Mostly, the matter has been abandoned with an excuse.
Before we get into distressing talks, we should consider what we can do with our colleagues to make unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Anything that doesn't belong to yourself is borrowed?
There is barely something more nervous than taking after a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday, the tape was still on the desk - it's gone this morning?
Or is the lost bullet scooter discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without question, nothing should be borrowed by the colleagues, because they are rightly angry when they find that something has come away.
So, don't put any coverts or post-it out of the office in the pocket, because it could meet oneself: no more if you need it urgently.
Get through the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a stake that has already been put into the world.
Who did what to do with who?
Where and why?
You should not bind the information (or suspects) on the private life of colleagues to the nose if possible!
And if anyone opens up and tells us his inner secret, we should not misuse this trust!
The best one is to silence like a grave instead of just align the present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Not reported without reason?
If you call in the office to report sickness to painful headaches, because you just feel discomforted, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one: your own work, indispensable executions, projects with fixed dates now have to do the colleagues rather than yourself.
So do not be bad to the colleagues!
If you already know that the next day you will not get it to the office, or that something could be intervened for which to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss will be confronted unexpectedly with the absence.
Total, Chemistry, Telephone
You're just deepened in your work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud chicken of the ladies?
Didn't you want to listen to a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
You should not nerve the colleagues with sums, sings, loud talks (who leads over their heads), trunks, permanent swamps, or nails.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just deepened in a task (write, plan, organize).
Are the others always blamed?
If a project is not completed in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not seek the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It's best to confess his mistakes, and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make the mistake again, or how to recover the missing one is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training case and sleep: Comfort for home, but hasn't lost anything in the office!
Not even then you should dress so low if it would actually allow the workplace!
Don't be too slippery - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so far as you dress themselves in the office accordingly - if desired, also beautiful and elegant!
Everyone wants to make it right - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the midst of the day-to-morrow.
From the radio a strange melody sounds: The sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The pace changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The home music scene has not spoiled us with high-quality electropop for a long time.
But now you even see the boot differently when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting production from the local digital underground scene slowly contributes to a change in the overall image, and even if the garagenrock is again "in" with its guitar quit, which proves homely electropop: there are new ones under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer began in Pécs, even musized in the band Yonderboi before he began his own path - perhaps because a host house does not bear two peppers.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melted elements from Jazz, Electronic, and Pop, but he only managed to come to him with the request to compose the soundtrack into a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török.
The formation, which had occurred at first in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ran its first album from 2002 under the top 50 home albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, shortened the almost one, even in the west marketable trend setters.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but nobody interested in whether they liked to wear this brand too.
The band has responded as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album, "Cannot Walk Fly Instead", now appeared, could open new ways to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression originates in the time when Baláz Zságer was still traveling with another band.
The airy, flying play would also be fine, but besides the etheric character of music, the - the time spirit and trends corresponding - louder guitars, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the Premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it a radio striker - the mr2 Petůfi, who has been sending mr2 to late pop music since the latest, has set the earworm with the number "Wings of Love", which has been recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is okay (?).
The hvg.hu asked at Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: how much does your music remain in a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "Schichtmusik" doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two boxes in pop music, not Mainstream and Underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be seen and non-profit, but they can also be produced only for the sale that makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The listener's willingness to receive works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: abroad, especially western of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twens on concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that pass around them much more attention, because they also think they are part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, the music does not develop for a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is mostly noticeable in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but they are only in the intangible changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed one thing: If you want to make it right, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We're not really going on his way, even apart from trying to interpret this again and again in our music.
We see ourselves rather as a team player who trusts in the musical presence of the other person and can unfold them.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took another way.
hvg.hu: "Wings of Love" is the first place in the charts of mr2 Petůfi.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style in the direction of a wider audience consciously inscented?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that would then be held as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be a final of the album with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why just she, what was the lead principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to compile the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
So the six-headed choir – so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Eniků Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh – we then baptized "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Would you like the song, or did it have the girls?
B. Zs.: The number was already in the instrumental version, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still needs something.
The chord sequence formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody that night, later they learned the girls.
It came all practically on the ground and distressing spontaneously.
I can remember that I was quite electricized at that time, but it already needed the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, the impression was that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (except from the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, they sing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their song is not only accompanied by music.
They also stood on the stage behind.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing behind was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we consciously didn't want them to get solo rolls.
In the number it is also about forgetting his ego a little, forgetting who came from and where to go, we simply allow us to raise these certain wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euforical state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most excited song?
B. Zs.: There was more difficult tasks when mixing musical work.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play at a concert class, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove wanted to not work longer, but gradually everything has joined together, like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number of the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes continuously with the concerts and also now where I have the album "lossed".
At present it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and "Never The Same".
Betrayal brokers risked billions of inferiority feelings
Floorless fraudor
This is the name of his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French Bankenriese Société Générale, owner of the Comerční banka.
It came about almost five billion euros for it.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do it at the same time to his colleagues, and certainly wasn't incapable.
In contrast to all large banking houses, he recognized the crisis on the American mortgage market in time.
"He's rather psychically weak," he was heard from the mouth of his supervisors who showed him with the police.
However, according to Kerviel's statements, which published the French media, for example the Le Monde daily, was a man who had earned 1,6 billion euros at the end of last year with its businesses.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In summer he managed to earn half a billion euros just at the American crisis.
The opportunity to do so had already been seen at the beginning of the year.
In February there were first news that so-called Sub-Prime mortgages, such as income weak customers or those who had earlier disbursement problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe this and kept right.
At the end of the year, he screwed his profit up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Because I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain this," Ker veel admits and continues to say that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole hearing, he admits that he has falsified documents so that you can't get him to the shame.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex Stock Exchange gradually interested in his businesses.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to flee?
Hardly.
"I thought she satisfied the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately following his graduation at Lyon University.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was an assistant of a mathematist and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90000.
Still, he knew that he would never deserve as much as others.
"When I first talked in 2005, I knew that I was watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained the inquiry officials.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the alliance's shares, he earned much by setting a half billion euros on course losses in the London bomb attacks.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, let's get you.
"That's like a snowball," he said to the policeman.
But the bosses supposedly knew of everything, or knew it.
"As long as I earned money, the eyes were closed."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the big blow came.
On one day he lost a billion euros.
He wanted to balance that on a weekend in the middle of January.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they come to him?
Suspiciously he made himself through a vacation.
"I took only four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to look at him in the cards," Ker viel said finally.
Czech Republic has the opportunity to reach 365 billion
Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed nine development programmes yesterday, through which the Czech Republic can come to EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion crowns).
It is about half of the sum that Czech Republic can get from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be given about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Infrastructure Fund, which will be over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme aims to help entrepreneurs and companies gain funds to innovative enterprises.
This aims to gain finances for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the previous EU funds acquisition, the Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in the new accession countries.
Nicaraguanian court confirms twenty-year prison penalty for ex-presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year imprisonment penalty for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (about 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguian Metropole.
Whether the former Head of State (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is back behind grid, according to the AP News Agency is currently unclear.
The president of the appeal court, Ileana Pérez, says it will now depend on the detention officers, whether to let Alemán sit at home, or whether he has to go to prison.
A court held four years ago that Alemán had regularly moved money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional, and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund set up by Alemán for the financing of his 2001 election struggle.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The government budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government, which was adopted by the coalition majority without support for opposition.
The ČSSD (Social Democrats) was still approved for the year in which Minister Sobotka (from this party) had presented it, and the ČSSD could not allow him to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion for a resolution of consent against the Government, no dramatic thing has happened this time.
The House of Members approved this traditionally little respected, yet very important law in all rest.
That's paradox.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is covered by the power struggle of the government and opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, so they devote more attention to him.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober numbers.
The government budgets suffered from three weak points in the past social-democratic governments, which the budget cannot be eliminated at once for 2008:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is obliged by law, not only for pensions, but also for social expenditure, which has decided the "suspendent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finance, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the largest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and in some way under control.
But a real time bomb is the household deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, except for revenues from taxes, taxes and bank credits, issued additional sources of investment, often untranslated debts by which they obsoletely debted their councils.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts by massive sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks which they had received in the course of privatisation from the State.
Now this source is already sealed.
As far as we only hold ourselves to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
For a few years, like the rest of the world, our economy has passed through a growth phase, which the ČSSD has been fameless.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to reorganise public finances.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a huge shame that is mainly due to the former governments.
We are among the countries that are at least threatened by poverty in the global scale.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have been overfluential in the last few years.
Even though it has succeeded to delete some of the insane popular expenditure adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it does not come to a shift in the age of retirement and a retirement reform in the future, practically any policy in that country ends, and no matter who is in power will continue to be purely managing him.
It is only easy to overdrive if one says that then, from the ruled politicians, officials will become, which will mechanically divide most of the tax revenues on pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the penetration of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns for 2008 would be absolutely superfluous if earlier governments had not spent over the last ten years, which was only going on.
If we do not want that it really comes to becoming pure administrative officials from ruled politicians, then we need to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, but who is aware that the State can only spend as much as he can take on taxes and fees in order to wish peace in preparing further reform laws.
Only these allow for gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the UK Central Banks, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together the crisis in the financial markets.
Thus, more than 100 billion dollars of auctions will come to the monetary markets.
On these auctions, banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it loose for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time, after the attacks of the 11th September, that the central banks of the individual States agree on such a coordinated approach to defense or a reduction in the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that the banks can grant," wrote a report for its customers Bernard Baumohl from the Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the probability of recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion, especially in the United States.
Analytics expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have really been afraid of what can still happen when they decided to do this," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks have the fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans for their customers will also be more expensive.
This would reduce consumption and reduce the American economy into a recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided, after they have not managed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank interest rate used in borrowing between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, although the central banks of the USA, Canada and the UK had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, the case of the real estate market in the USA.
Klaus: Discussions of ecologians are incredible
Global climate change allegedly harms developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus reiterated the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, no green planet", he stated that the debates of the ecologians were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference inacceptable, which represents a strange mix of government representatives and such non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the Rhetoric which it accompanys and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is only replacement for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in the idea of his book that his subject is very important to him and that he is therefore so engaged in doing so.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often meet caricatures of my views."
Now, therefore, interested people could read his attitude without delay.
Klaus reminded that he was not a climatetologian, but he believed he has sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is academic, capable of understanding and assessing professional discussions, has experience with statistics and is also economic operators.
As the main statement of the book, he described the these that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and thus no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are overflowing, inacceptable and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers it as a person who has experiences with totalitarian systems to impose unacceptable, other unproved views, he sees it as a dangerous limitation of freedom.
He repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not consider the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600000 drivers failed to exchange their old driving licence, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where one can apply the exchange so that the authorities can be able to issue a new driving licence until the end of the year.
The Ministry, however, does not fear that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers enter the streets without valid driving permission.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to ride around their licences have failed.
While small towns report a strong decline in interest in the voucher exchange, the offices of the capital are covered with applications, and the interest in exchange was still growing this week.
The city administration completes around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not exchanged their driver's license yet.
The exhibition takes a new driver's license for 20 days.
But it is possible to apply the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Car drivers who do not create the prescribed exchange until the end of the year and ride without a valid driver's license, threaten a penalty from January.
The evildoer pays up to 2000 crowns.
But the police can also make it turn with an exhortation in the event of transgression.
In case of transgression, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the one of the municipalities can also be imposed on a penalty which does not go at all.
It was said that he could threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry already called the offices to let mildness govern and to impose a penalty of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one was grieving a thousand crown penalty.
The licence is a document where everyone can decide whether or not he wants to own it.
It is not a personnel certificate that everyone must have, and that is, a valid one.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give their driver's license.
It is enough to bring it to the competent municipal office or send it there by subscription.
At the end of the year, driving licences are invalid, issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, the drivers must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three more years for the exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Judgment reduces penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having done jointly with David Berdych's bands, received 13 or 10 years in prison.
This, in a ruling, decided the Prague Oberlandesgericht, which reduced its penalty by two years or by two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Amt for the Battle of Organic Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
Against today's judgment there is no appeal, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Mr Berdych himself is also accused of this matter, but at first he is facing the first-instance judgment.
In other processes, however, he had already received a total of 16 years of penalties.
Too much more he cannot be condemned.
In January 19 people were guilty of participation in robbery, the Supreme Court today negotiated the call of 16 of them.
Most accused objected from the beginning to the charge with the reason that it is a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police submitted information from police sources with Berdych criminals, covered various robberies, and helped members of the bands to withdraw persecution.
The bands left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the probe.
The claim concerns the crimes of the bands from 1999 to 2001.
Especially for robbery, whose victims often suffered severe injury, but also for official prerogation and unauthorized possession of weapons.
The police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to the claim, the band has enriched many million crowns by its robbery.
In addition to almost 20 men in this procedure, courts Berdych and a number of others recognized legally as guilty for further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's circulation must be responsible in another process, other cases have not yet been brought to court.
The main negotiation is Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish prison and are waiting for the final decision on their delivery for criminal persecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - Invoice: 12 million
The lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to spend 12 million crowns in Třebíč from the hospital plus court costs.
For each of the mothers every three million, for the fathers each two million and for the children each one million.
The hospital offers up to 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore does not agree with the Velebas proposal at all.
"We reject such a proposal, it is a lot too high," said Dostál after today's negotiations.
"But in order to give us an opinion on this counter proposal, we need the opinion that had the opposite side.
We will find whether it has any statement.
But we believe that this should be in the hundreds of thousands together," Dostál emphasized.
According to him, the amount should move between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion that had developed for him the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children, according to experts from psychology and psychiatrie, suffered mental damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men forgot the stress situation better, even if they saw accusations against them that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborn.
On the other hand, the women are more affected by the consequences of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is going on now, Veleba collapsed the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the Entbindungsklinik in Třebíč on December 9th last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the Vysočina district chief (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe) delivered 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses caused by the failure of the hospital in Třebíč, under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by laws for liability.
In any doubt, they must take a reserve fund, but they can only apply exceptionally to the institution.
The courts have so far allocated comparatively low compensation amounts, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polívka came to his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the brand "Königreich Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in many years of work.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiations today.
However, according to his lawyer, the matter is probably not terminated and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute concerns that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitary," said after the Polívkas lawyer.
All were present in the words "Walachic Kingdom" just these actors and comicians.
The same opinion is Harabiš.
"We have an almost ten years of work behind us.
Money creation and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is for money.
"After years they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have something of it too.
They want to win parasitary at our work," he continued.
Lukrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But at that time, this did not relate to the intention of establishing a fictionary kingdom.
Some years later, Harabiš came to the idea of spending walagic passports.
A business and an entrepreneurial activity came out from an originally funny action to which Harabiš joined the establishment of the "Walachisches Königreich" company.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passes and even offered discounts to his owners when visiting his farm and theatre.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only used the only idea that Polívka had published in the "Manege" mission for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has surely helped the project of the Walagian Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team had been dedicated to him intensely.
The collaboration of the parties that are today disrupted lasted by the year 2000, when Harabiš organized the official crown for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, between Polívka and Harabiš, the disputes began to be held in the deposition "König Boleslavs I".
The leadership role was then applied to Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a queen mother.
In 2002 Polívka submitted the action against Harabiš and his company, which the court refused today.
Clearness in the dispute could bring Harabiš's prepared competition around the throne and half a princess.
This should lead to a new king.
He didn't want to betray details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like the king's conversion in the Walachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can join him in a quiet way," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Preparations to disappear
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not worth much, the quality of the transmission switch, steering and also the processing could be described as more under-measurably.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The Combi with the name SW is still a piece further, and I just stay to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the too low head freedom on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer available, because the combi's carosserie is designed so that not even two meters will suffer.
Quickly Continue
I'm just going through the interior so I can't repeat too much.
It is a really successful design, where I only have objections because of the careful middle tunnel.
There I would welcome some more design design where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times where we may complain about too short seats or head supports.
The sidekeeping has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
With regard to the space offer, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the carosserie.
In the Combi there is also the lack of head freedom mentioned above.
Suitcase in the suitcase
But the main thing on this car is the charging room.
I have to call this (also because of the rear window) very well beladable and space-saving.
The hollow rooms are equipped with holders that represent an ideal compromise.
They don't disturb, let yourself get apart, and hold harder objects.
But we're talking about the charging volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains with clearly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a foreign holiday or when loading a child car.
But to highlight the positiva, I still have to mention the very flat charging room or the very low charging edge after the relapse of the back seats.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder benzine engine with cylinder 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that's how a 1600 cubicle engine that drives a family hatchback.
He's quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes works as if his outpuff was hidden with a lape, then I can only be excited by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not just national.
But we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious inside and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine at the height of 329900 crowns is still going on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite much.
The equipment Premium of the test car sleeps again with 80000 crowns in addition to book.
However, we had headair bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc switching solution, electric window lifts back and...
This is how the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but once you calculate the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the decision remains which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not successful
At British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, which causes local fears for the further development of local schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has so far arisen from a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe to British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between the local and Slovak immigrants gradually increase.
Discussions, arbitrations, and rebellion among students have transferred to the relationship between parents.
The situation has evolved so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with a iron rod.
The accused defended himself with the boy being insulted with racist insults.
The police also had to attack a Slovak migrants after the attack of two minor girls.
The girls supposedly made racist remarks to the man and struck him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus cabin and spucked on us.
When I told him to stop him, he ordered us with apples and pears and then blew out his pocket," described a mother of Slovak students of the newspaper The Times a further unpleasant incident.
The complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival fight.
The cases mentioned testify that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is increasingly excited.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks have been reported on job search here.
Some 30,000 Slovak students therefore visit British schools.
Cuba - Beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, that will be fulfilled if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and all Inclusive with cellans offering on the beach Pizza, ice and delicious cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you can find this in a large measure.
But only on an island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba was its bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that has ever seen a human eye.
Havanna once became a camp or passport camp of treasures that the Spanish had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American epoch came.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered crime in the USA (especially during the prohibition), was liked and supported on Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew over the wide boulevards of cars, which were one of the culture symbols of the fifty years of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
At the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your cargram.
At the bar at Hotel Nacional, you mix cocktails for you as much as you wish.
And the cult cars of the fifty run around in Havana until today, because the once imported chigulis and fiats in the salty and moist air have long been collapsed.
Mag Havanna, especially his oldest part, has fallen strongly, nowhere in the circle you can find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just poured out, for example Trinidad.
In order to ensure that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was green light for this development.
In the past fifteen years, new hotels have not only been found in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Cuba and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marot, which is unique in the world, especially attracting railway lovers.
The sugar tube of remote plantations brought steam and the same driven narrow tracks to the sugar plants.
Her flock park has not been renewed over decades, and there are clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion targets
The most important places do not leave the majority of the visitors of Cuba.
You don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
Just to mention that there is a museum in the property Hemingways mentioned above, whose visit should not be missed from the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba.
The luxurious vegetation grows on calve floor.
The Mogotas, limestones and collars, rising steep from the valley floor, gathered fruitful soil in their hollows, which also covered the wounded rocks of dense growth.
This valley is where the best Cuban tobacco may be cultivated.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factoryes.
Some may also seem interesting that the chilenic episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was rotated there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Rum and wealth brought her the trade with slaves and sugar.
The riches embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has barely changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is a so remote place that there was no road there in the fifty years of the last century that the area had connected with the other country.
This isolation helped to keep it unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but that's why nothing was destroyed, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón Beach or the "Tal of Sugar Factorys".
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, who live after the darkness, and where the music doesn't swear until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba represents some as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo must overcome high and crushed mountains and run through a landscape that is barely affected by human interventions.
This eastern proximity of Cuba has taken UNESCO into its World Heritage Directory thanks to the uninfluential nature there.
There is the best chocolate produced, the church shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it is created about a hundred years after the rides of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present Hotel El Castillo, stands, there are several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra-Maestra mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, over the tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuban patriarch Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, a African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess themselves, about all that one could write many pages.
But as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, claiming Americans.
According to the United States, too little soldiers and the lack of equipment are affected by the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should design a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to its ideas, the representatives of the countries in Scotland agreed in Edinburgh, which stationed units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating countries also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, by its Minister of Defense, Robert Gates called the NATO units for more activity, Great Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan a advance development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow the inhabitants to start a further development of the economy and security," says British Des Browne Des Browne, the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of Afghan rebels has reached the highest level for five years.
The number of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, even in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached an absolute limit on the organization and equipment of the units.
Concretely, they require further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific goals for the next time and how we can reach them," said Gates.
Today, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke similarly.
"I am not happy about what we have in Afghanistan to land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hope of Reuters Agency for the conclusion of three-day discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been disputes in recent months about whether all alliances in Afghanistan give their best.
For example, because of passivity, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the south and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
This week, the British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" called German soldiers as faulded.
"Afghan nonstue: The Germans play games while our boys fight," wrote the "Son" in a contribution that was complemented by German soldiers, playing the table tennis.
The German portrait went to the counter attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a Rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will accelerate in 2009 to a billion
In each Czech country, a government debt of 84,000 crowns is deprived.
The total debt increased to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to debt this year with 159.2 billion conen.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policies, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The Czech Republic's government debt increased to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they decreased by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its statement of State debt from the beginning of October.
Every Czech is debted by 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state was debted by more than 111 billion crowns.
"It seems now that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the border of a Billion Krones until 2009.
Next year, the debts should move between 900 billion and a Billion Krones," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, sees it: "We could come to crossing a billion over the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political stage is to be shown, and politicians should be ready to save more, this could last by 2010.
But I don't go out of such a change," he noted.
Debt growth
The government debt comes from the debt of the government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the State budget.
State debt is financed by debt statements, government debt, direct bonds or, for example, by borrowing of the European Investment Bank.
The national debt has now increased to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The government's foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how good the economy is.
Interestingly, the growth is mainly due to the debt debts, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that debts rise, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," said Pikora.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of government debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned this year to record 159.2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policies, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount is mainly affected by the State budget deficit, which this year apparently will reach 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum budget for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion crowns, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of public debt orders for 43 billion and the amount of loans for the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For that she gave a name to a Teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused in Sudan for the insult of Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday evening by a court in Sri Lanka and subsequent expulsion.
The British was accused of having allowed six- to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She would've deserved to be pissed.
After parents of students complained several times at the Southern Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary teacher, who worked at the Unity High School of Kyrah, was at home on Sunday and, under Article 125 of the Southern Criminal Lawbook, accused of insulting Islam.
In fact, this matter takes its start in September when the teacher invites her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classeddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school leader Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Mohammed as the best forenames.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature My name is Mohammed.
The bear itself did not wear a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered to be an insult of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues from Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew it well, and she had never done anything that she could be too close to a religious belief, I only regret that she has asked the children to vote for a name, his opinion is only an innocent mistake.
One opinion that shares many students of the teacher who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks about religion in the class.
It is noted that the first name Mohammed is also the second given second name in Britain, for which in English 14 different writing methods exist.
This often chosen first name by Muslim families is considered to be a kind of honor to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, may you give him a toys?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday there was no agreement at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo have finished a sixth and last discussion session in Baden, Austria, Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not agree on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With emphasis on the challenge of peace in the region, the American counterpart of Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina urged to comply with their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the discussions beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and pointed out that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the mediation on 10 December
The intermediaries of the Troika, which unite the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet in Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province inhabited to 90% of Albanian speakers could become more clear when Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council until December 10.
The discussions of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiation session since the Troika had received the mission from the UN last August to a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect to end their contract on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, continue the negotiations beyond that end date.
Russia was and remains forspeaker of a negotiated solution, a consentable solution, said Botsane-Kharchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under the supervision of the EU as the only solution with the future.
Pristina is willing to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in favour of it.
Belgrade is based on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held the last chance since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the cosovarian rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
He added , however , that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations .
Domino effect
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tradic believed that a compromise was always in pursuit and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly an "domino effect" in a region that has been so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation stated that any decision was made solely in the Security Council, where their Russian allies have a veto law.
Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision from the series of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists replied to Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status, adding that each unilateral declaration of independence of the Albanian speaking population will be completed in liaison with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had gathered under his direction in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He continued that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians have to destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must set up his colonization work, Bush explained, reminding the two parties of their commitments in respect of the plan for peace agreed by these in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abba's last aim at a peace treaty, which should clarify all open questions without exception, and including the central issues.
This name includes the three serious problems that turn the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians mainly: the future borders of Palestinians, the status of Jerusalem and the destiny of Arab refugees, which were displaced from their home in the present state of Israel during the conflict of 1948.
After the U.S. president, Abbas took the word and made it clear that the coming negotiations will be conducted thoroughly and provided a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, the water and the security.
When Olmert took the word on the other hand, he committed himself to direct and without interruption the upcoming armaments negotiations and to try to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the time limit for the implementation of his vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli one who stands together for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has received a guarantee in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has led to a plan taken by all Arab countries, offering Israel peace, in exchange with its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war in 1967, including East-Jerusalems.
Annapolis represents a separate path in the history of the Middle Orient, especially because it attacks on the roots of the conflict and its central faces, the Saudi-Arabian prince in his interview with the Arab-speaking daily newspaper financed by the Saudian money.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are opposite.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations by the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), a police car traveled on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 17 o'clock.
He had no use, but was on strike, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a spokesman of the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without authorisation, thus not released for public road transport (see below), came, driven by two youths without helmet, with very high speed.
It embraced the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its direction from the right, a policeman continued.
Alcohol control carried out in vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (adulted coat wing, split windscreen, crashed booth) testifies to the intensity of the collapse.
Very quickly, last morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that she had entrusted to the IGPN with an intermediate work on the "facts of the involuntary personnel murder and the lack of help to people in danger", in conjunction with the main district management for public security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor explained that it excludes the responsibility of police officers to identify the IGPN at this stage.
According to the Magistratin, three witnesses of the accident, which were heard Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small power wheel has arrived relatively quickly to their left side.
Yesterday, a sort of ribbon, surely caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were hooked up until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles were confiscated and will be subject to technical evaluation.
The body of the two victims was obsessed yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a germ quickly made the round, so the police would have left the accident site very quickly, and that without helping the two young people.
Although IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude any serious mistakes.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations for which further investigations are necessary and in which we need to be very careful.
Libération has hit an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, right away to try to revive her again, this witness tells you.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who went down.
Two more attempted to revive one of the young people who called the fourth .
In view of the tension that was rapidly about the event and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unforeseen situation of the young people, the police of colleagues who had arrived at the accident site were taken into the car.
According to this witness statement, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police went away.
They have also used cardiac masses, but in vain.
I'm not gonna let you say that the police forces wouldn't have helped the young people.
The first aid has been made to these young people.
The firearm has come right now.
It was done everything to try to save it , on their part the prosecutor emphasized.
In Pakistan the tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police had defeated the first demonstrations since two days before General Musharraf had been called out of the emergency.
According to testimony statements in Lahore City in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated action against the I framework of the emergency were injured by the tear gas granates that employed the order forces there.
They threw them with stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court asked for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositionelles, defenders of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court were locked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had been found in Multan (midde) and Peshawar (North East).
On Monday, the lawyer movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president asked the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the emergency, and to those who put a oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer applicable
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The chairman of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and dismissed.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contradictory to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of The News stated.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the upper order on the army and to become a civilian president is no longer valid since the call for the emergency, declared on Monday the Vice Minister for Information Tariq Azem.
It was expected that he would deliver his military uniform until 15 November, the date on which his first term of office ends as President.
The Vice-President for Information has also confirmed that the elections of January could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denoted the rumors in the country, which said that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence from his deputy leader.
Still more than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as badly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law allowing the prevention of contraception in France, one of three pregnancy (36%) is not planned, as a study of the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as badly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of precautionary prevention such as the pill or the spiral are still a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pills used between 20 and 40 years of use of the pills increased from 5% in 1970 to today 60%, liberalisation of the prevention of contraception has still enabled a better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned today.
For one of five couples even calculated precisely to the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season, in which it seems most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will need more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is essential for continuing scientific work on the station.
A dared exit, which has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of inhabitable modules, the speed it has been organized with, and the tools that the astronauts have crafted to perform repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from the Space Ferry Discovery, a large cylinder-shaped part that is about to take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module lab.
But you must be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17,5 tons of heavy power generation module over solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After she had moved it, the crew went to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose span length is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can fold like chocolate was damaged by a sticked cable on a length of about one metre
The restructuring was stopped to no longer damage the collector.
The astronauts, who originally leave the space ferry Discovery for a control run and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30 meters long-distance arm of the space ferry at which the station had been installed to perform the repair.
He is one of the best spacewalkers of NASA.
Large, resistant, very skilled, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old doctor was chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully assessing the damage, he separated the defective cable and fastened a kind of rail on the damaged place.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who stayed near the Schleuse, and, from inside, from the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool that he used a mini-hocky beatser, converted with isolator, to prevent an electrical stroke on the solar collectors that produce several hundred volts, the astronauts had designed and built on board the station.
When the action was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely folded before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space ferry Discovery today to probably return to the earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS at the stock exchange sanctioned
After the aviation and defence group announced that it will have to spend between 1.3 billion and 1.4 billion euros in order to counteract the residues of the A400M, the EADS share currently shows a significant decline in the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently EADS loses 4% to 21,96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review their business forecasts for 2007 once again with reference to the residues caused by the only slowly progressive development of the A400M engine, which delay the aircraft’s younger flight.
The cost announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amounted to EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion, more than one billion for Airbus , and the parent group of the European manufacturer of EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results, he added without further details.
The Group also indicates that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month residue.
In order to remember that EADS's business performance fell from 86% in 2006, significantly due to the costs related to the delay of another programme, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned the first delivery of A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The Choice of Status Quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting at the listing of the Urns: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's Party, United Russia.
After a very dissolved campaign, she confirms her pursuit for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Wladimir Putin sends a message to the voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as a top candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml party for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President had nothing to see when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was pleased to deliver a new attack point against the West Powers accused of the interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they did.
It practises an oppression-infected campaign.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there had never been such dirty elections, even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of demonstrations last weekend, ex-chess world champion Garry Kasparovder has been sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer continues to ban visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two many further questions arise:
Who will take Putin's success as President?
The term of office yesterday announced the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make known until 23 December.
As he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Wladimir Putin cannot take a third mandate in a row.
And now no successor is found.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of Parliament's majority and the Almighty Party of United Russia, will the government and President choose?
Whatever it will be, at the parliamentary elections or at the presidency elections, the power to date will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not the master of their fate, sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: The bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which has been christianized to Europe for five centuries; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
According to the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin reconnected to the model of a paternalist state, which was completely accepted by the population, the more since this new paternalism did not follow terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman says of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians, from free pieces, abandon the personal responsibility they have demonstrated in a short time after the decay of the USSR.
What are you thinking about for a long time?
This phenomenon concerns all social situations, including the business world.
And the Administrative Unit understands to maintain the status Quo: 65 Governors (from 85 Russian regional chairmans) lead to the local election lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equal to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The generality prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: To what do you think for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they dissolve?
A Hard Memorial
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17,5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which were housed at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now unless it was humanitarian intentions, so individually and namely, so on request of a former victim or family.
In May 2006, the eleven States, including Germany, France, Israel and the USA, commissioned to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Certain information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will be possible to carry out research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the prisoners of concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, explains Reto Masters, head of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were able to make these name-related documents available to the public due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or the spiritual disability of some deportation victims, for example.
The inmate lists of concentration camps or the imprisonment orders issued by the Gestapo were gathered for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced work, and to provide them with some evidence of their arrest in order to make them the way to their compensation.
Today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 firms work on tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There is nothing to expect new in these documents, Mr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism of the Technical University of Berlin, explained 2006.
The EU and India want to obtain a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, the mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches the 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is the most important trading partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, indicated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers have given the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations in order to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), which are already reaching EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission India is only the ninth EU trading partner.
A free trade pact will make the two economic spaces enormous progress and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe forms the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued. The Asian and European giants exchange goods of EUR 47 billion per year and services of EUR 10 billion, explained this week Daniéle Smadja, Chairman of the European Commission in New Delhi, and regrets that the mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India meet their eighth diplomatics in New Delhi, the Prime Minister of Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso will be present on Friday.

The Bank of England takes note of the distress and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about reducing the current repetitive disturbance on credit conditions and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
In order to weaken the fears that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly hard at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty of how they should organise their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase which starts on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, it indicates in a communication.
The Bank further explains that on 6 December, GMT will convert 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros), to the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE in an open-market operation will circulate liquidities for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its Communication, the BoE adds that it is ready to take further measures in order to obtain the interest rates different from day to day of interbank loans with its basic interest rate.
The interbank interest rate differed from day to day on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The rate of three months has increased to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums circulated by the Bank of England have been linked with penalties that the banks had prevented them from using them.
According to certain rumors, strengthened by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many prefer to sign for the sums that were circulated by the European Central Bank, to more beneficial interest rates and with more safe discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review the PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist law template for purchasing power, which is similar to the rejection of the text.
The text produced under a socialist niche (sitting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) indicated about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, most of which was the contribution of 50% to employment, to re-implementation of the TIPP fleeting, to a transport check or to restrict the rentals.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered a partially severe change of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before the television contribution of Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchasing power.
The director of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the entirety of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative plan for the correcting of the finances which had been examined last week by the Assamblee.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumours about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promoter/Productor announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no longer and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones shared from C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 organizes the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre large private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, previously known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most renowned festivals.
In 1989 he took over the headquarters of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owners, has also taken care of production, the license concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now take up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been there, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work together to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We have selected Philadelphia as a market and work with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have stayed in political debates on the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happy we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival at an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has restored the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 in Grand Park Chicago after it has profiled itself together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival in 2002.
The two events have been able to achieve 9.8 million $ in 2007 and 11.8 million on gross tax days.
These two festivals take place in urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while the incense are more on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts together in some way, at the same time to convey the impression of a rural festival to the European and urban in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the load of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
Lastly, it refuses to award the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and take up a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival "is very large" in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very versatile in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no lesser than the Terminator is against it.
These locking attempts are among the delegate tasks.
A political "heicy mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, appoints " Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governator"?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think best," he says.
The run at the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, at the moment, the predecession of the cinema there has the highest priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festival on the West Coast, although Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about to present the movies from Quebec, to evaluate them and to ensure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful idea at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented on the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented on the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute festival.
Is the stock exchange ahead of an end-year rally? Unanimity in the experts due to the US hypothesis crisis
At almost five weeks until the annual conclusion on the stock exchange, the investors are already waving their hands with regard to the coming end-year round.
Nevertheless, experts cannot create safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December at the stock exchange normally involves a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to create forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not when serious tensions determine the current market performance
Although other experts do not approve such a strong rate increase in the last weeks of the year, they still note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and market participants. These invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secure share funds, which are severely affected by the up-to-date trend towards profitable assets.
Therefore, according to these experts, the stock exchange will be more likely to show a more lateral trend of market fluctuations, especially because we are not yet able to assess the extent of the possible fall in the interest rate of the US note bank, a uncertainty due mainly to the increased price of raw oil and the risk of the increase in inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the Sales Division at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market round.
The opportunities are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish share index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest mark on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, Analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully conclude the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional granting of the pension cash every year at this time.
Nevertheless, the expert stresses that this year could develop things differently, especially because of the end-year round already held in the second week of December, and thus right after the bridge day on the day of the Constitution.
The Analyst considers that price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, Analyst at the Bank Inversis, the previous assessments on the market situation are at a nearly technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values which depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
In selecting the values that Ibex should drive to new maximum levels, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney regrets that this year are the great values in the row.
Among the value gains, the expert would be the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha of the Bank Inversis assures that the increases in the banking and industrial sector will take place.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACP has been on a recruitment course in the last few months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same way, according to the expert.
With regard to increased consumption during Christmas days, market events will be determined in the last half of the year’s periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive revenues, even if they are only represented in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only in two cases declined courses.
At the end of 2003 the technology blossom led the stock exchange from its crisis and simultaneously initiated the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which Ibex 35 raised by 28.17 percentage points, December showed an increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will result in the fifth profiting year (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and a final year's rally will be shown.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of his branches.
In total, 200 of them are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, as Popular is the first banking group, the jump is waging to extend the opening hours of its branches weekly to 20.30h and to apply Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The Banking Group BBVA, which also reiterated the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement, where 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for them on a weekly afternoon, although not for the customership.
Whether further banks join the new initiative adapting to business opening times will depend on the experience values of the Popular Bank.
And this is also the intention that popularity pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening times of those branches, which, due to their situation, can cover the purchasely customership of self-employed, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large stores.
The Bank wants to open up the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will transform the premises of those branches already in business zones and at the same time compare them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is linked to a new space design of the branches which is characterized by a more recent, colorful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require larger investments, but increased staff as a branch now needed not more six, but eight or nine employees.
The establishments, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets of Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to be a wise decision.
Popular currently leads about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also show extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide selection of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to represent competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With phoneica, they have been agreed to sell using external bank personnel mobile phones.
For the first time, the Spanish private channel Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value and thus conquers its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the Managing Director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the close of the stock exchange. The sender he led had increased his value by the twofold of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, fought his joy: that is exactly what is hurt me; not that we have increased growth, but that we have less losses, he found.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not been too deeply reduced.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its current losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches EUR 4.488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52 %), and Vocento is only 13% involved.
The Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40,5% since January, so that its market value is half by 2.193,46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other publicly noted communication companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, at Prisa (Cinco Días magazine) to 2.518.53 million and at Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, says Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question of how much we can actually act on a market-technical basis, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco explained his project to rise to the first television channel this year with more than 1000 million gross gains from advertising revenue. This was the case with Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and public paña, the group's advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the transmitter would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net revenue increased by 1.6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business could only increase 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco's better exchange history is the analysts at the high payout ratio, which the company was able to show up to this date: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría's company managed a 100-prozent dividend payment.
However, Vasile assures that after the purchase of 33% of the shares of endmol, with media set as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for official notice.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have ever given much more.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose shares we have already been able to increase by the purchase of 33% of the shares.
According to the Analysts, the market is currently showing some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation in Telecinco by 4% for this year and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
This has also decreased the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: set on its high efficiency and sustainable potential and therefore recommend the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: as a result of the multiple incentives and the prosperous market, Telecinco (coupling) measures a more advantageous position as antena 3 (keep).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to reduce expectations in both cases in view of the similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to Parliament's drafting, which today concluded its meeting with the Senate Congress Decision on the additional amendments to the project, the government published the provisions arising from the new law with the intention to enable both regulations to enter into force until the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of the Congress and Senate Members who, in their negotiations and votes, had pursued the aim of setting up the best possible arrangements to ensure the security of investors and regulate the individual entrepreneurial activities to ensure a generally efficient market performance.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, the MIFID, which redefines the securities service regulation, pursues improving investor protection, increasing the demand for control of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables specialised companies as well as natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS) to the consulting companies that are associated with investment and intermediary companies of securities.
It also extends the number of systems for the implementation of financial transactions, so that the regulated circulation markets will be added to the multilateral systems of the impact business and to the systems of internationalisation of trade contracts, which would eventually come into competition with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to register the priorities of their corporate profile, the confrontation and the forms of handling risks on the market, and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The Economic Commission of the Congress continued to provide further changes, with the decision that, due to its high risk level for the investor, the debt depreciation for the US mortgage and banking crisis has now been confirmed by the US crisis (US mortgage crisis).
It also took advantage of the entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the working areas of diplomated economic scientists; 30 years after the 1977 Regulation, which restricted the areas of work reserved for economic scientists.
The Senate, on the other hand, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator who works on foreign account does not require authorisation from the CNMV and its services for commercialisation of products and for customer recovery at the same time can offer several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (ICP) has increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication corresponds to the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which are aimed at a local and quality comparison with U.S. products.
The forecast for the indicator can be created in advance by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using several other statistical modelling methods to assess the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) suggested that the prematurely identified indicator should only serve as a correct value and therefore not agree with the final result announced on the next 14 December.
The consumer price index (ICP) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and Economic and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI in November was a temporary development; at the same time, it assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes found in the halls of the Congress Building that even if the present number is not good, the inflation difference of Spain to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less equal in recent years.
He also explained that there were less surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance announced with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin is calculated with Northern Rock revenue of more than 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half, after the bank had been crying in mid-September last year, the British note bank had asked for an emergency credit, and they are now only 12.000 million pounds (which corresponds to EUR 16.800 million).
At that time, the assets of the Bank were roughly 25,000 million pounds, a sum which has significantly decreased within two and a half months by the customer’s loss of confidence and even despite the government’s hundred percent guarantee that the money is safe until the end of the crisis will continue to decline.
Virgin company, who would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, must spend about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be composed of the plants in the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their 30 billion target.
The group of multimillionary Richard Branson, known by its prominent advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to flow 50,000 million pounds (equipped about 70 million euros) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, where three more companies are involved, as his preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for suspected suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular), due to the urgent suspicion of urban corruption that was discovered this week.
One of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of the municipal police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo held the office of Juan Morales, currently Member of the Partido Popular and then Chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could be, according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER, the original wire drawer of the team.
The officials continue to search the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged Member Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client's residence on the basis of important burdensome documents to be associated with the composer.
In addition, other sources of information from the supposed order payments of Morales to a Galician construction company that planned the conclusion of a urban contract in which the construction of a large area of 200 hectares was decided.
At present, eight persons are investigative.
Bono agrees to accept the candidate of the PSOE in Toledo and, the case of a election victory, at the convention.
The former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will launch the list of the PSOE candidates at the coming general elections in Toledo and, in the case of a election victory of the Socialists, take over the office of the Congress President.
It has announced José Blanco, Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, and Bono at the press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the headquarters of the Party.
The Head of Government believes that the offer to the former Minister is justified, since it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the coming elections, the politician from Mancha would seem to be the president of the Congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress Presidents. He had announced last 15 November that he would no longer join the next general elections, terminate his career in public politics, and instead engage in the university area for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that the president of the government had constantly threatened his return to political action since his resignation two years ago.
He also pointed out that, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs , the party would not want to prevent citizens from taking over the posts of the Congress President in the event of a election victory and referred to it as an act of transparency .
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to convert the Chamber into a house of respect and not to insult or screaming to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Sadly, from time to time, one gets the impression that the only place where one cannot speak quietly and left in Madrid is the convention, so the president of the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and his good work and pointed out that he did not seem to have taken over the office since otherwise his political counterparts would call this as arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate undermines both the scepticists of climate change and those who focus on this issue on social and political debate, the movement as a whole must show a strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, brings it in a statement note of action or non-trading of its government, which has contributed significantly to the fact that Spain is within the EU at the top of the countries which have at least met the requirements of the Kioto Protocol.
Those who are responsible for non-compliance with the requirements, on which sectors this is due, and why his government, who proposed the Treaty with the planet, did not stop this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present to Spanish citizens the measures it has provided against climate change without any change.
Which companies will be affected by the behaviour of the citizens, the individual and collective savings measures to be implemented and the economic consequences.
In particular, who must offer himself and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will be no such explanation in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and paying.
Because the measures that can be implemented against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol center proposed by the PSOE appeared so dangerously in electoral terms that Zapatero was forced to resume the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now true to save the planet with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty Proverbs without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its contracts with the planet, the politicians, otherwise suitable for election campaigns, do not have to speak, nor claim, but rather follow the demanding issue, delight the meetings and enthusiasm with his gentleness and goodness.
But this can only happen if the contract does not differ from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not suggest that the bike will become the only means of moving in the future or we may only refresh ourselves with a vessel.
The mayor and chief of the police of Totana due to a presumptuous development in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur were kept in custody of urban injuries today.
The city council was arrested at its residence, from which it was brought to the municipal office and in whose premises it was located until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the urban administration and at the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which showed that more than 2 million hectares of unclosed building for urban projects under the direction of the Galician construction firm Nuaria should be reorganized, which should be established on the property after the local administration has been able to read illegal commissions during the last legislatorium.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but subjected to a investigation procedure which was initiated and carried out by the first Totonas court.
The first six arrests have been presented to the judge today.
According to investigations, the former mayor of Totana and currently independent PP members Juan Morales are also identified.
In addition, his ex-wife, holder of a property company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend who resides in Murcia is suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the Managing Director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company has served as a part of Nuaria and has to receive the smiling money.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban delicates, under the supervision of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, took 11 further searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests held in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At this time only one person was arrested in Totana: the holder of a regionally known poultry industry, which is supposed to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria construction group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the Murcia village, which should include more than 5000 apartments, golf courses and two spa hotels.
In Totana, the company purchased more than 2.2 million square kilometres of area which was to be rebuilt. The aim was to achieve a construction project which would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which in Vigo car parks of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen

If you agree, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and, instead, try to find a price label other name with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to submit your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat, commentary (Finland is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; randomly on that day, whose issue contained criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the field of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the School of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murder is an abiturient who quoted the works of Platons and Nietzsche in his news.
The Chairman of the Education Council for the Faculty of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, in an interview of the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat asked the teachers to take a more critical position toward Platon and suggested to delete the teaching Platons from the sub-priorial teaching plans for the Facility of Gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal law book:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law of six months in prison.
But once again, if you take out a music business under a value of 400 euros, this is only considered to be a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of EUR 1000, the stealing will become a criminal offence, yet the penalty will fall less than in a download (Article 234 criminal law).
C. If you clause a car and give it back forty hours later, then the penalty is still lower than in a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a battle than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious dispute takes place a prison penalty of three to 12 months after itself (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange has resulted in a six-month withdrawal of freedom to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less bad than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization has not taken place by the authorization, is subjected to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should have the right, then someone has screwed his demands very nicely.

My household doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when others get more.
So the feelings of the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of colleagues.
The study was produced by a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the last edition of Science Magazine Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Hirn Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and failed his competitors.
The researchers were able to recognize that brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were correct with their answer and thus received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure that it really requires so much scientific effort to reach such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been fought for eight years after the criminals of the Balkan Wars. Her office is located in the prosecutorship of the former Yugoslav court, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will run out at the end of the year, and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, since the chief responsible of the massacre of Srebrenica - which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - the ex-general Ratko Mladic and the former serbo-bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on a free foot.
Her names are listed in the list of the director Marcel Schüpbach from Switzerland as a presentation for the title of his documentary films La List de Carla (2006, not yet in Spain); a film which, with the pace of a police thriller, pursues the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her plan to detect the escaped criminals and put the respective governments under pressure to tighten their networks.
What insurance is best for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost expense, which depends on the amount of various factors, including age, gender, time of the creation of the driver's licence, family status, type of insured car and use, etc.
To own a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear what we have to do with this.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insured person.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which determines that the company receives the depreciated insurance premium and, in return, is obliged to submit the corresponding amount of lodging in the event of a injury.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance composed by several factors, including age, gender, date of the creation of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or used.
Insurance companies shall determine their prices according to statistics, so that higher risks of accidents will also increase contribution payments.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make less contribution payments, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as they tend to be less accidents than alone, according to statistical values and according to the firms' convictions.
The benefit to which the vehicle is measured affects the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In setting up the premium, insurances must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that meets its personal needs.
We are now listening to the most important points that should be taken into consideration when choosing insurance, not only to make a performance-oriented choice, but also to make a price-oriented choice.
The 25-year-olds meet numerous obstacles, such as the low driving practice and the young driver's license, when choosing a cheap insurance.
Even if it would best be for an ideal insurance protection to complete a full insurance insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full cosco with self-participation so that the benefits of a full-cosco insurance insurance are covered, but at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount resulting from the damage itself.
The amount is fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain's principal representative at First Europe, a intermediary company for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance that assures customers of external accident damage, but not the damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs, so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a lowering of the basic rate in the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in charges.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on society and their earnings.
If the company has a profitable year behind it , it can be allowed to increase bonus payments , explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. For this reason, the fact that with increasing driving practices the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most useful to decide for a full-cost insurance with self-participation.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of driving , explain the Spanish leader of the European company, adding that the majority of the accidents occur in the second practice year after the fear of the beginner was put down.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not own children to complete a full cash insurance, of course only if it permits the financial situation of the corresponding person.
Insurers' sides are considered to be couples with children as customers with the least accident rate, and accordingly their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full cash insurance with self-employment (in a amount of €300) would be the best option. If you have received a high credit, an extended insurance that is only used for the third year of vehicle.
They drive more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera establishes.
For pensioners, it is possible to conclude a full-cost insurance with self-employment (with a amount of 150 euro) or an extended insurance which only uses a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, you need to note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it is high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan on the point for the eighteenth final
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight in San Siro on the next Tuesday for the point they are missing to reach their respective goals before the conclusion of the Championsleague round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group while they decide to participate in the scotches.
The Italian team already has five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a difference in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow needs another one with nine points to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not bring the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth game round, as the FC Milan must join the FIFA World Championship in Japan, where he will be fighting for the first time in the semifinale on the 13th day of the 16th.
Thus, this group will be completed before all others and the differences in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the most expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow that they would be the first to win in the event of a victory group and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even suit a defeat at a lap of the FC Shakhtar. However, he should not trust too much in such circumstances, because at nine points, the Ukrainer is entitled to participate; although they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win in the second game (2-0).
Therefore, the Mailants will try to rent the scotes the evening. The again hopes to reach the eighth finale of the transformed Championsleague after they were defeated in the preceding season in exactly the same round by a gate of Kaka in the post-time (1-0) and by a zero to zero differences on the hind.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri victory, the team will have to concentrate on its own game, as both the reach of the eighth final and its membership at the UEFA depends on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win the third place and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In the Canadian Vancouver, the Spice Girls gave the start of their first tour after the resolution of the band in 2000 in the sight of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the beginning of her concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that the mood was excellent in the reunited band.
About 20,000 people were able to live with the concert in the sold out stadium, where a video of the history of the band, which had provided for Furore at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the publication of a new album, which includes its largest hits and two new songs, headlines and Voodoo, which appear in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls carried golden arm bindings on stage, which had previously been given to the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athletes were among the fanmasses in the audience that led the GM Palace to glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had banned him in the previous days.
During the preparations to the Schow, Victoria Beckham explained that the British Star has not seen our wardrobe any time, and that is why I am already very excited about what he will think of the appearance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 was two years later due to internal disagreements, expressed the resolution of the group two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed that the feelings had changed to the Spice Girls.
And that's why I didn't think, so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed the separation of the band she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also made it clear that the disputes were eliminated and all of them are now very happy again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last common appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, after reporting the CTV TV TV, the group arrived in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received from a army of children.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will appear next in California, San José ( December 4th) and Los Angeles ( December 5th and December 7th).
They will enter the stage in Madrid on 23 December.
New fears of natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new prize dispute between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) is directed by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is very closely observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow is to pay the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will be charged by Russia for higher transit charges.
A previous conflict between the two countries has reduced deliveries to the EU countries last year.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom try to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be more calculated as the group agreed to pay up to 50% additional gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversation," said the Minister of Economic Affairs of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of Reuters' News Agency.
"The change in natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest gas supply, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "to control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-payment registers for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought together in June with the attack on Glasgow's airport.
Black also expressed concerns about the fact that the Scottish state health service does not confer accurate ideas on the number of its foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important controls were properly carried out in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow's airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a terrain car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transfer in October in Old Bailey, and was stressed in connection with the suspicious autobomb attack in Great Britain.
It is expected that the state health service shall carry out checks on foreign employees in advance in order to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorizations in order to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use disclosers Scotland to verify pre-payment registers, the Agency does not have the responsibility to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Executive Board should take up guidelines for the criminal register withdrawal which will help employers to control in different countries.
"Although we found in some personnel documents references to these controls, these were not routinely carried out." The report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigative directives with a high degree before their appointment, but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved in order to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of foreign health service employees."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in advance of the appointment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could handle future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current pre-condition tests of NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have foreign employees, the majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is probably higher, even because the boards had problems identifying those employees who have been licensed at an indefinite time.
The investigation continued to establish that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely observed.
These include passport, work permit and qualification controls.
the Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for controls prior to the beginning of the appointment of foreign personnel in the NHS.
The secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a concern for me to perform this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices are reflected in updated guidelines on the control investigations in the prior direction of the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad, which will be published next month.
Joy Division dominates film pricing
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division Sänger Ian Curtis has home five prizes at the British Independent Film Festivals, including for the best film.
Prizes were also granted to main performers Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before casting for the role of Curtis, to director Anton Corbijn, and adjoiner Toby Kebbell.
Ladies Judi Dench was awarded as the best main performer for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond writer Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize that he made the British film to the world public.
The prices were delivered in a ceremony in the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis rise to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 with 23 years.
The black and white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was turned for just 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has introduced two prizes to Dutch photographer Corbijn, so far best known for the culty cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree – as the best director and the best director.
Rock music was the center of another prize winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the prize for the best documentary film.
The prize for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafiabosse in David Cronenbergs, London-playing Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is calling hard guys to play, has picked up Richard Harris's prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest are currently filming the Indiana Jones continuation The Kingdom of the Chrystal Scull.
Winstone said he was proud of getting the prize named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I had the luck to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film prices, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winter Bottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist team
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it had arrested 208 militantes because of their belonging to cells which had planned an upcoming attack on an oil plant as well as on clergymen and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest petroleum exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle missiles.
Sympathisants of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an alliest of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man strongly fast intervention force to protect plants according to a misleading Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial declaration, says that 18 of the arrested were one of a cell that was led by a "rakette expert" who illegally migrated to the country.
He reports that the soldiers had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, more 22 of the prisoners had proposed to kill clergymen and security forces.
The government has warned more to do to stop Saudis who strive to connect with Al Qaida Milizen, who wants to fight the Allied Armed Forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim Government, which is considered ketric by the Hardliners under the Sunnic Saud.
Al Qaida Milizen considers many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The Milizen - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia to target it on the pro-western Saudian government - have departed from foreign residential areas, government buildings and facilities of the energy sector.
"This was a very great effort from the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman of the Ministry of Interior informed the state television.
The arrests also dealt with a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical sunnic Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims, which are branded as unbelievers and apostasy.
Among the arrests were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on the Venus could show a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship located on a circular road show that the planet is even more like a degraded twin of the earth than it has previously been aware.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbour of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary tracks, but the Venus of the Sun is a little closer.
billions of years ago, on Venus, would have ruled conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even be inhabitable, believe scientists today.
But because of the most unspoiled carbon dioxide tribe effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through sun radiation and a slower rotation rate, the Venus introduced a completely different development course.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning towers.
The findings of the spaceline Venus Express of the European Space Agency, which has examined the plants for a year, provide an intimidating view of how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on the Venus is so different to which the Earth is, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enables a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago, perhaps with an inhabitable environment."
"Enriched Uran" confiscated by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, according to an enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police speaker said that three people were arrested and that the material was checked.
He did not confirm whether it was an enriched uranium but said that it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
In the middle of Romey, he did not hold it worthy of a presidency candidate to be interviewed by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally declared himself willing to take a debate on YouTube, in which normal electors take questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman, the Democrats asked about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time exactly the state of the Republican Party that breaks up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just as the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with the candidates to show the upcoming YouTube clips.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was longest devoted to a single subject, immigration was central.
The subject is one of the most striking subjects for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of independent electors to use a electoral disc when they heard things that liked them: The TV station observed tips of consent when the candidates strictly spoke about the borders.
The tightest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who moved forward in the crucial surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake the reputation that he had been generous about illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney, in which he accused the former Governor of Massachusetts to have stopped illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly intensely disagreeing as a questioner who asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the Illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More important candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congress Deputy, and Tom Tancredo, a Congress Deputy in Colorado, managed to follow this issue.
None of the two men have serious chances of nominating, but both stay in the race, perhaps because they have cut earlier and harder than others on the immigration spoil.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates generally share the same views: sharper limits, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears of toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered to be tortured.
One questioner asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani’s view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was imposed on whether Jesus would support them, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains extraordinarily wide open.
Huckabee's ascent in Iowa, together with Ron Paul's recent contributions and his convenience towers in the debate of Wednesday.
These two were shot out of nothing because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a twin core to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall down; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly lucrative.
No adels' titles seem to be sold, no politicians paying Paris's hotel accounts, no extramarital toes have been smiled.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has swept donations for the British ruling Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) under the name of other people over four years, and that the party has failed to report this, something has happened without what Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister dismissed the demand for a choice, the intelligence of the British intelligence in the way that he claimed that opinion issues had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, the increasingly sharply represented president of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown developed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unsuccessful rescue of Northern Rock, a attacked bank, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgment under guilt.
Badly thoughtful proposals to amend tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The tax authorities’ loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative sanctions.
A trio of generals in retirement started a retirement in the Oberhaus from protests against reductions of military expenditure: to be Minister of Armed Forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the various donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and her former leader of fulfillment) has already resigned.
Nothing of this means that Brown breaks up irreversiblely towards departure.
However, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel impossible to rule.
Neither do people trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new troop takes the office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister improves the situation, and he does not even need to be there for a long time, this excitement is over: the public service begins to be ignorant; the Ministers of the Government begins to plead; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and purposeless.
In one way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new confession.
If he'd like to deny Tony Blair, he was his superleutnant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax law documents, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it wasn't directly involved in Blair's misgeschicke - as in the long "geld for adels' title" investigation of political party financing - the electors may assume that it was.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as she looks
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or he was totally faded.
And the counterpart, painful as it may be, is delivering what Brown's natural stalinistic tendencies always promised: A reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new gap for political donation is a good example.
The garboeske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, does not wish public recognition for his will.
That may be the case, but the decision on it did not allow him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who said he knew of Abraham's agreement, but not that she is illegal, will of course have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial operator, who was told about the extraordinary donations in October.
But until now Brown is not involved: There is nothing that indicates that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his official acquisition in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he washed this determination by grasping according to a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - to complete the measure, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, "the teachings to be drawn from" are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
In addition to that, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, how to find a permanent chairman for the independent Public Standards Committee, which has been unattended for six months, and to advance with a cross-border reform of political parties' financing.
This would require the hardliners of labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly to abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party member like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
Conservatives now have a clear leadership in the opinion environment; they have two years to recover electors; and the only way he can achieve a victory is by incomprehensible justice and solid competence.
Cardhais
Does the borrowing crisis affect America's credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it's only natural that backflows are excited.
Now that America's real estate market is ill, the cattle have the country's credit card market in the visor.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs expect that credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the risk of infection of underfinanced loans spread to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are rises in both the accounts and the rates of allowance measured the share of loans which are not included or more than 30 days too late.
The HSBC announced last month that it took an estimate of $1.4 billion from its American consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card operators.
It's too early to panic.
Loss and suspicions are still low.
According to the Moody rating agency, the third quarter of the solar rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the Councils can partly be explained by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which represent a large part of the Kedit card losses; the number of notifications (and allowances) would rise again, whether the general conditions for creditors are deteriorating or not.
The industry also reports about solid payment rates which show how much of its debts pay consumers every month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the silence in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the volumes of expenditure for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are sure: it is more likely that consumers take credit card debts, now drying home credits.
However, the card exhibitors look at the flow of money instead of capital, so falling house prices do not necessarily solve a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
You can even be of advantage for the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates decrease when the real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important under the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can also react much faster and more flexible than creditors to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid revaluation of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and completely re-evaluate the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main financial reference.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable decline are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction in America are pushing into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep them looking for these shark flies.
British banks confess themselves guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be put to court for their role in the fraudulent system with the former principal financial leader of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their request in guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally been innocent for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 in order to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was set up on January.
But during a hearing before the Court of Justice before the U.S. district of Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone accused of a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during the course of delivery procedures that took two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end of an investigation that was started after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The original accusations against them in 2002, Fastow pointed out that he was the aim of an investigation of the government in connection with Enron destruction.
The accusation against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they had come to Houston in 2000 to terminate a fraudulent composer with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron, which was controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent enron companies that contributed to swallowing the company into the bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiarity at zero, but the three British men knew that she actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the shares of the bank in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Koper $250,000 for participation in this company.
According to the claim, Fastow wrongly represented Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for their shares in the subsidiary.
But the $20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, heads and others sent about $12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004 Fastow announced his role in Enron's Pleite in two accusations on conspiracy.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a six-year prison sentence in Louisiana's federal prison.
Header is a penalty of three years and one month in an establishment in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot on the basis of a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company of the nation, broke up in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of bookkeeping tricks could no longer make billions of debt appear to be profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron Founder Kenneth Lay and former Chairman Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles related to enron breakdown.
Skilling is a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other accusations were void after he died last year for heart disease.
Not completely below in Moscow
The price of a plane of the brand Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce motor and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least $ 54 million.
But this is small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a business president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millennial Exhibition, a four-day orgie from the present consumption, organized in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxurious exhibition stands had been built, hoping to renewed Russians interested in everything, from Mahagoni-dailed yachts to diamond-transfered car grills, which would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a shiny orange porsche at the next exhibition stand.
"This is a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems to be flooded with money like Dallas at its glossy times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab flies of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world's most open-minded money publishers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold rush.
Otherwisewhere in Moscow this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, Chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell high-cost goods in markets like Russia.
(The Conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, totalling 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires are the second class worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of the Russians lived under the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jewelier.
For the first time, she had visited the trade fair together with the Russian trader of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary, and the men are all worth a wealth."
While they go through the halls on Sunday night, two real estate masons, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked for the cars and I try to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing she wore, like a Red Teppich Veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to focus on the new ones, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be ready to stand in the steep for several hours to visit a close warehouse, which, unfortunately, put Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives of platinum, Mövenpick Eiskrem, tailored billiard tables, appartments in Dubai and Gund Teddybers next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, the patriotic sitting at a exhibition stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-size imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climber climbers."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old in accordance with Russian standards) have already moved from large-pure logos to the type of nutritious brands with limited number of pieces that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousands of people, whether millionaires, messengers of millions or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two 70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, kaschmir and cotton, with fitted gold threads.
In the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, also said that a company equipped high-end cars with high-end alert systems that his company sold the big orange porch for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, said a company adapting luxury cars to customer requests, he would have sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are connected to each for $55,000.
He showed a reporter an author reef, developed for a Russian casino owner, with speaks that he had overthrown with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a rouletterad.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-payment.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants to have bouquet leather bicycles or a picture of his wife's face from cubic circonium, will not necessarily go on these wheels," said Mr Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-way garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russische Millionäre" would not presently express much exclusiveity, given the rise in the real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who weren't millionaires could at least do as if they were rich in a state operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian assets management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells according to British model, which were completely stacked with mountains of false million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his employees had printed 500.000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passengers continued to throw the bills around, mobile photos, while rejecting themselves in the midst of the substitute wealth, to be cut by friends, or simply to insert a few millions.
"See that in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Sustained surgery suspects when death occurs in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest memorial festival when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched a ambulance at the white Cape Cod two doors below the West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the box car of the medical body viewer coming," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone died."
They learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newarker Police Decernate.
Now the intermitters try to determine whether she died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetical surgeon that the police did not identify, and who worked in the house at the West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found what Ms Arroyo's death has caused, and they hope that toxocological investigations whose results could not be available for weeks will help to clarify a mysterious death that sent a grief through the headquarters of the Newark police.
Since September 2006, Ms. Arroyo was an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and hard-necked," said Mr. McCarthy about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarker police officer who works for the alcohol control commission, and that she leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a prosecutor for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that Ermittler would try to find whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Ms. Walsh.
"It's a ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared for death on site.
More than one week has passed, and the authorities have not informed about their investigation or about the owner of the house, listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was interviewed by the authorities.
The intermitters try to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castros House, where a bleached rose smoke stands in the narrow pre-garten and calls a Dalmatiner behind the house.
A blue barrel descripted with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanillas in foods and perfumes - sat in the parking area next to a door that led to the lower floor.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, "You have to take care of this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I arrived here and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the Central Bank will reduce interest will lead to an increase in the global share markets
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic after market hopes that the Central Bank will try to calm the credit markets through further interest reductions, reinforced by decisive comments by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The share markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the president of the Central Bank, said that the policy "flexible and pragmatic" had to respond to the persistent pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down treacherous markets, in the light of signs of upcoming credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulences would "partly have reversed some of the improvements of market functions from the late part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were made by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is willing to enter and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The versions also helped the Wall Street to calm down, in view of further bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US real estate reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulences were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their worldwide employees, in a cost reduction measure in order to compensate serious losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these stations will disappear in London, where the Bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.5 percent, to close at 13.289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6.306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-establishment of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after a strong demand for a auction of three-month guarantees from the European Central Bank, which had been granted to the European Commercial Banks, had been granted considerably 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to follow the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to invoke further capital to the monetary markets in London increased when the credit voltages saw the three-month "Libor" borrowing Councils between UK Banks with 6.59 percent rise to their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since November 21st.
England faces with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to be hit as a number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the election, is here at least under this special title to help the chief trainer Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English business director, is gradually filled with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for those in part-time.
Anyone who does not get the sixth batter position will be unhappy, but life is often injustice and sports is undoubtedly unfortunate.
It is never easy to nail exactly what allows a man to reach the top of his career, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult where judgments are necessary which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does it?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders with good conclusions that know the business well, should be transported.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless it is given the opportunity to swim or fall.
Of course, figures have a great impact on decisions, but opportunities have.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a batter has to get regular chances on order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricket player.
To catch the eyes of the selector is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, when James Anderson was, who seemed to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harrison explains himself for health and how the wind kicks into the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wicks with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their glossy points and hoped for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiria Stadium, only one question can be.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or maybe it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was still fighting to strengthen himself, who created the breakthrough to an important test cricket player and, although he pointed a double dog against Australia in Australia, maybe still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion in the course of today's network meeting at the Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and abdomen feelings for Shah's more experience about Bopara's youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his funking and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22 years, and an excellent balance against turning balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home army as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection of the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to withdraw his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his beating, which was still openly known in Bombay.
On the other hand, the all-knower from Essex has splendid joy of life.
He was impressed by nothing on a cricket square, and his position away from it was placed on the point when he had recently missed a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick out his vodafone (naturally also sponsored) and call his teammates Alastair Cook who had observed this from the distance, and to say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he kicks his medium rate with some effect here on the playgrounds, which seems to fit to him and sleeps with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe this is the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah may not stand well when, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus charges of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Bagdad, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some even returned to fight the rebels they had displaced from their homes.
At the bus station Mansour, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operated with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transportation.
"I decided to go to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Bagdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Bagdad, and how it would be safe."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, in relation to the shy milizens of the military clergyman Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered to reset his forces at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominant solar part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia, supported by the U.S., helped to drive Al-Qaida from its bastion in the western part of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new inmates from Jordan was the leader of a Sunnic and Shiitic tribe, who had been displaced from his house in Sleikh in northern Bagdads by an attack with hand granates after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaida miliz in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I have returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told them that they had been attracted by the increasing tranquility in the capital since the U.S. troop increase and the growth of local "groups affected citizens", which armed and defended their districts in cooperation with the American military.
But more talked about being forced home through visa problems and defensive funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exilants that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are probably fleeing from the sectic death swadrons in the country.
"We went well until Al-Maliki visited Syria, and the government urged the Iraqi no longer to give a visa to force them to return to Iraq," said the sunnic pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
A part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnites have been displaced from Shiitic residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that a sudden flow of refugees will shrink back sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, Good Education
The smallest federal country is leading in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in a field of education, the Saar countries express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I've explained for the 50th time to a non-Sarland that we are not French" - this slogan posted the smallest federal country self-iron to his 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is located in the Education Monitor of the Institute of the German Economy of Cologne (IW).
As a result, the universities are already cooperating closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
By now, students can conclude their studies with a double or even threefold diploma.
Accordingly, the share of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But the national children also bring the Saarland to the universities in an over-average number - many of them without a degree at the gymnasium.
"In the Saarland you use the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, educational experts at the IW.
More than one fiveth adolescents are entitled to study at a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also relatively strongly expanded.
Measured by the population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
That is why the Sarish Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"In general schools, after the first pisa study, we have started several reforms," says a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced national comparison tests.
So that the children start to learn earlier is the last Kita year free of charge - a model that is now copying other federal countries.
Whether the benefits of students are sustainably improved, future comparative studies will only be shown.
In Pisa 2003, the percentage of risk pupils fell from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal countries.
The Bavaria expect better.
And for the distortions of the Saar countries, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - otherwise one could point in this area.
Because the language of the neighbors is obliged to Gymnasia - even if the Saar countries are not French.
Chávez transforms the clocks
In Venezuela, the watches are shortly different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets the timepieces turn back in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela notified, a new law states that the clocks are adjusted to the world time minus four and a half hours.
The South American state thus gets a time zone that is not in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez founded its decision, among other things, that the United States of the world would have imposed the classification in time zones for too many hours.
In addition, Chávez announced the cancellation of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia on Wednesday (local time).
The left nationalist said, as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia stays, he will not enter into relations with the Head of State or with the Colombian Government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is leading to a constitutional reform, on which the citizens of the oil country must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was Uribes' decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, in which it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe criticized Venezuela with his decision "spoke in his face," Chávez on Sunday.
Chávez is also in Spain in all mouths.
A new cell phone rington in the country provides for Furore: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
He spoke to Spain's king Juan Carlos, who had been generated on the recent Ibero America summit by the constant interim calls of the left populist and was driven over the mouth.
Deutschen threatens 2007 Lohnminus
In spite of the strong economic growth, German workers are threatening a real wage loss this year.
Experts called a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees in 2007 could actually expect less salary than in the previous year.
"Should be the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the cost of food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Image" period.
New burdens could also be paid to workers in unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent in the change of the year would be correct and reasonable in the present situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not be embarrassed to ask for loans or grants in the covenant, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday, the price explosion in food and mineral oil products was announced that the inflation rate has been the highest for 13 years.
Overall prices increased by 3.0 percent in the year comparison.
Venus is the ancient twin of the earth
The Venus is more similar to its life-fighting atmosphere in the earth than until now: The European spaceline "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and windwirbels on the Poland, as they occur on earth in winter.
For almost three decades scientists have suspected that it is flashing on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has proven - it has felt electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on the Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the Scientific Magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "ursuppen theory", flashes have caused life on earth: Thunders are supposed to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on the Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is barely something living on the surface of the Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than on earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's twin of the earth, but it's a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is similar to the earth in mass and size, has affected such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research since the beginning of the nineties, since no probe had been on the way to explore this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "natural" articles, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the commonities of our neighbouring planets with the earth are greater than initially accepted," the Esa notes.
In addition to the already known wirebel wind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloudy turtle at the South Pole, which turns much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air flows on the earth's winter hemisphere, writes a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second interior planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning star or the evening star, crawls around the sun in almost 225 days.
But it turns much slower around itself: a Venus day takes 243 earthdays.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a 92 bar pressure hardly reminds the earth, scientists assume that both planets have been created under similar conditions.
Both gathered waters that remained on earth in oceans but were lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbon stones, it is the majority of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Köhler defends Merkels meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the parties' dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor Office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for their attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares for Germany's reputation and has asked the great coalition to end the dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world in this regard," said Köhler to the trade sheet.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the difference between cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President emphasized, but Merkel took protection from the accusation that it operates a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not removed from the traditional one-China policy.
That also knows China," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly demonstrated distress about the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the Union's "Shut Window Policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellor Office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only invited the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of both countries according to information from the SPIEGEL.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to confess the reception of the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China dismissed when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The acts and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he tries to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns about Krawallen as in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns about crowns as in France.
It has to be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany is not in force on the road, the Federal Minister of Interior demanded.
Barrikads burned, Randalierer shot on the police with scrap flints: After the heavy youth crowns in France, Federal Minister for Infants Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to be careful not to build up social explosives with us too, and to escape in violence.
We need to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hannover.
Not every young person comes with the rapid change in social reality.
Bund, countries and municipalities have already worked hard to remove problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"From integration summit to the Islamic Conference, this already shows the first success."
However, it is too early for diswarning.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that in German suburbs there are no urban and sociological problems such as in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris, young people in the past nights had delivered heavy street battles with the police.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater integration efforts by the Federal Government, however, demanded the president of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawalle in France, Kolat warned of "Nachahmungseffekten".
Although the situation in Germany is not as brilliant as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Colat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people with a migration background below 25 years was "over-average high".
In particular, more training places have to be provided.
Colat stressed: "We have to give young people a perspective."
However, the president of the Turkish community added, in Germany more than in France, "social control takes place in the families".
Moreover, many young people with migration background did not want to destroy what their parents built up here.
Colat said, "But we still have to be careful."
You have to give young people "fast the opportunity to participate in work and training".
In the meantime, it remained largely quiet in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of the police were in use, a helicopter flew the area with headlamps.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trash and cars.
Since the morning, an offer of about 1,000 security forces has been providing peace.
The police will cross as long as necessary, Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday, some 80 policemen were injured at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following respect, the turmoil took over toulouse.
The Krawalls were inflammation of a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
After the first insights of the prosecutorship, the police are not guilty of the death of the young people.
In the Empire of Angela Wolke
The reality-wide appearance of the Chancellor documents that the coalition is at the end of it - and that nothing can be expected of it itself.
What country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After her uncomfortable appearance in the General Debate of the Bundestag, which was worried and poor in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country which was finally ruled by it.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation of too much focusing on foreign policy with an arguingly superstitious sentence.
That is provincial, she said, and so she showed first that she did not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, she has documented to everyone how much their accusation is.
There was neither concrete interest nor feeling a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: an aborted politician who flies into foreign policy and even remains in danger.
For example Climate Protection: As it praises the decisions of Heiligendamm, it does not say how to achieve the climate targets in this area.
Mostly, the self-lobe - so much indescribability would have failed the CDU chef two years ago.
Now she's sticking to the flosses that the uprising is coming to the humans.
So she damages her image as a Praguematiker who solves problems instead of talking the world beautifully.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal political problems are a marginal appearance.
Children's poverty and the worries of low-servants?
A few extra sets left for it.
It is noteworthy how often she promises when it comes to the child’s surplus.
Three runs need Merkel to get out of a half-way straight sentence.
It stumbles as on a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attake
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are delivering a hard drop - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already in the first topic.
He made New York a "resort for illegal immigrants", Mid Romney proclaims his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
This contends with severe accusations on his part: "I would say his own house was a port for Ilgale," abandoned Giuliani and prescribed the former Governor of Massachusetts to have private immigrants employed without papers.
The candidates blaze to attack: Because the Republican base has no clear favourites, the eight presidential prosecutors use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-rotated 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are barely more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism we have made Hitler come to power," John McCain suggests his contraent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romeney also receives the Levites strongly by the Vietnam Veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation that simulates drowns as torture.
However, that the major topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq War and torture debates show the reactions of the Saalpublic in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are refused, the auditorium puts an applause.
This shows again where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
"I've misled myself at that time," explains Romney crushed and makes it abandoned before the base and television public to ask that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
On the other hand, Giuliani comes to the castles when he is asked for the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled in civilian for the first time
One day after his resignation as the chief of the army, the Pakistanian captain Musharraf was defended as president.
This ends eight years of military domination in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was defended for another five-year term on Thursday.
The Pakistani television carried over the ceremony in the Presidential Palace of Islamabad live.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as head of army to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed international pressure especially from the USA.
Eight years after his power attack in an unbleeded military warrior, the former general now ruled as civilian head of state.
With his resignation as the chief commander of the forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand for the opposition and the west.
Another central requirement is the end of the exceptional condition which Musharraf had imposed on 3 November.
Shortly after his defense, according to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf's general prosecutor will lift up the exceptional state and thus fulfil another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him at the beginning of November, had rejected all claims against the controversial reconciliation of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Wazilstan at a attack on a military convoy and four more were injured.
According to an army speaker, the bomb exploded on a road near the border to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the herb rock return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies again music: The three band members of Harmonia re-presented their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
For the Revival, a co-cut from their great time "Live 1974".
At that time, they were much more famous abroad.
The preoccupied sensation is then happening in the form of three men on the evening table.
Everyone has its boxes in front of itself, its cables and above all its buttons.
Dieter Moebius throne in the flower white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Links flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is focused on the console.
Everyone contributes noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it is accidentally adding to a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to be greatly disturbed by the gentlemen themselves.
That the band Harmonia was re-musicing has provided some excitement among herbs.
What can be revealed here: Targeted demands indicate that although the name was worn by the collective pop distress, it wasn't so sustainable for 32 years to miss this band painfully.
But why should the German not also celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
For example, what is misleading herbrock, in England and America was always more and more considered than in their own country.
When the music economy gave the Cologne Group Can 2003 the Echo Prize for the Lifepiece, it was seen in questioning German popseeers in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the Laudatio bands La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the surprise did not know borders.
At concerts, Michael Rother later hocked the Red Hot Chile Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the declaration in the stranger is this one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmony because the trio existed only two years, and at this time also a much lower power of effectiveness has been folded than it was later assigned by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously muted with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First, they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label held by the Church.
Rother had just picked up with power plants and then played a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, who may be radical German group at that time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city-flying communists.
Less ideologically than in the commune I, where Roedelius was allowed to plague himself as a baby girl.
Earlier in a spicy artist's being.
There was also a wimper of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art in the locking waste.
Some of these were harmonica.
The first album was "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For so leave and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The rice collection did not serve the self-finding alone.
The CD "Live 1974" was now released at a concert in Grisesem, in front of an almost 50-country record, as someone believes to relax.
From Rother then came the desire to force harmony and practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band explained its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric sphere and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Heart".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than it was ever Harmonia.
The Griezesmer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
It has been the goal of maintaining the crowdrock as a true German contribution to live music.
New! has already been buried like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures in the world.
Publicly subsidised, in the context of the Festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, the old punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There's also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
With which the entire bandwidth of the influences of the crowdrock would be spread to the next pop music.
Harmonia fills the emptiness of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's sentence floats with the most special sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show producers with harmony in the farmhouse.
The legend formation serves projections of other black and white photos of wirr cabled equipment.
The three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drummer to unheard sounds of the instruments over self-adhesive appliances.
Today the electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technically deepened tüftler.
There's no change in the choir of the house.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgensterns, sound clouds are held and certainly sung and at a beautiful place with emphasis "Aaaaaaah!".
Crude rock was always a very English term.
It was never Rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music schools (Can), technologies (raftwork) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever calls here "'68' is not quite wrong, and Harmonia is not able to get rid of it now.
Even the most obvious is thought thoroughly on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you the nerves or give you flight moments of great luck.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
The "The Hunting Party" and "Morderal Peace" again address two films with the Balkan War.
But both don't convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and balls or they are too touching.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but out there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many nicely-unimportant roles in well-being films for women and all too many press conferences on Buddhism have pushed out one’s desire to see.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes hunting" (Why do movie titles really have to be as long and wearer today as lounge guide tariff contracts?)?
He delivers a marvelous momentum: basically, his war reporter, Simon Hunt, is what could have been out of charge, if fate and the film industry weren't so graceful: a man who has long behind his best times, but even as a ruinous monument of his downfall, has preserved considerable remains of the former charm.
But despite this trumpet, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Morderal Peace", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films continues.
With "Morderal Peace" you can make a short process: the film is dealing with two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a serbin from cosovarian hookers, which is the one who is in love with them.
Although it is welcome that the Serbians are not once represented as a sole root of all evils, the far-sheep film loses too quickly in Geballer and Action.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be examined exactly to be exemplary, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters, who come up to find the Serbian supreme war criminal "the Fuchs", could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and another scriptwriter (beides in Personal Union Richard Shepard).
Because the story is similar to it: Both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military can't do, and both times it will be a journey into the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not easy to be the downcoming cynician with heart when he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to make him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim bosnierin.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the bach when the reporters succeeded in the last five minutes in the timetable process, what Nato, CIA and all the world's headboat hunters did not do in five years: the war criminals caught and the Muslim Bosnians left to the righteous revenge.
This is so bad that one wants to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague on crimes against cinematics.
The film has a deepest human concern.
He wants to proclaim that Karadzic and Mladic are still freely running, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they are supposed to agree to be) not too intensely engaged in the persecution due to secret political talks.
But the good community and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem gets in mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the poet: "I see the swollen foreheads with compassion: how hard it is to be wicked."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads, but they suggest how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq films were Hollywood's large flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film before.
Almost always: If a star drives around the crises or mines in the world, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" comes out with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are too close in time.
After all, it had to pass decades before Hollywood could turn a good film on the Holocaust with "Schindler's list".
Some films may still be mature - the now classically applicable Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated in any way as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know today, where every mass murder comes home on the same two screens in real time, too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the scribes the doubtlessness it needs to tell good stories.
"Being or nothing" or "The great dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcasticly distant artist's view of the romance Lawrence Norfolk.
When the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War were questioned, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Great cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be murdered in a cruel way and always will rule war in Yugoslavia."
From Beust fermented criticism for Olympic Absage
The breakdown of the mayor from Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has been severely criticized in politics and economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the games at the water.
But by Beust, realism emphasizes the chances.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the chief business leader of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, called "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently developed as large motivation forces in the city as the Olympiaide.
"Without this goal, the sports movement could not be maintained in the same way."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to cherish the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "the one that comes from a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with previous statements that Hamburg's Olympia ambitions were at least unrealistic until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides about a Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports League," said by Beust WELT ONLINE.
He pointed to the decision of the Sports Association on a Munich application for the 2018 Winter Games expected for the beginning of December.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period that we have planned until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamed for all time, said by Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic Games over the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build a chance by burying the plans at this time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A refusal to apply is also contrary to the statement of the Senate Chief on the occasion of a reception to the General German University Sports Association.
There, Beust called Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 "not as a replacement" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion proposed that the Senate have not used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has set on the map Olympia and curtailed the housing building," said the SPD Deputy Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Small Grasbrook always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and later housing, the CDU has set on the "Event factor" one-sided.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had caused a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, failed to Leipzig.
That's not Warhol's boxes.
Who connects the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently in Sweden, wooden boxes throw dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the four and ninety Brillo boxes of the "Type Stockholm" are falsifications.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes in 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now a nervous result: The six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén made the Moderna Museet in 1995 as a gift, are copies - and probably also the majority of the about a hundred more Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm" that are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is nested, a confusing chain of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo box", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the carton of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet 1968 - with Warhol's consent - produced hundreds of Brillo boxes from Pappe: These were not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
They were not artworks, but their models, mere exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol in 1968 probably granted permission to produce a few Bruillo wood boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited in Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, who have rightly entered the history of art and auction as an authorized original-Andy Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have achieved more than $100 000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been produced and exhibited in 1968 in Sweden about a hundred wooden boxes, which Warhol left him.
In fact, Hulténs 105 boxes were produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at Moderna Museet, has also examined three of the six museum-owned Brillo boxes from Swedish private ownership, two of which were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm: your press boards were first founded and swamped, afterwards white oil color was applied with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of the 1990 copies indicates that the color with a painter roll without grounding was applied directly to the press span plate - it is not oil but acrylic color.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo box," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not reach another conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in his collection as copies/exhibitions."
In July, the Authentication Board announced that the "serious accusations" which are raised in the matter of the souvenir powder box should be followed.
But since then, there is an inevitable silence.

Manila's financial district was the main scene of the attempted moutery of around 200 military members against Arroyo.
After almost 24 hours, the rebellion failed to join the army.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts to fight democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
