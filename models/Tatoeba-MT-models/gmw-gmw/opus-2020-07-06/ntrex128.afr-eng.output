Members of the Wallian Assembly are worried they're gonna look like stupid.
There is consternation among some members of the meeting on the proposal that their title should be changed from AM'e to MWP'e (for member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Wallian Parliament.
Members of across the political spectrum are afraid that it can attract a ridicule.
One member of the Workers Party says his group is concerned because "it's with Twp and Pwp rhym."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means excess.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group was "receptive" about the name change, but noticed that it was a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of stupid or foolish.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any description of what members of the Assembly are called, of course, will be a matter for the members themselves."
The 2017 Law on the Government of Wales gave the Wallian meeting the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that had received a large support to call the meeting a Wallian Parliament.
As far as the AM'e's title is concerned, the Welsh Parliament elected Members of WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM'e seems to be presenting alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal on the changes within weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes in the work of the meeting, including rules on the disqualification of AM'e and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last saying in the question about what they should be called when they discuss the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change in country’s name
Choosers will vote on Sunday if their country's name should be changed to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The national voting was arranged in an attempt to eliminate a decade-long issue with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens already demanded for a long time that the name of his neighbor in the north represents a claim in his territory and repeatedly made captivity against his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the national vote on the change of names, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of names is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silent because churches in Harlem are struggling.
"Historically spoken, said the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"No of the two are there today."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize in other ways these days," he said.
"Crogues are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is worried that the money will not keep out of assets as long as leaders expect, "and earlier or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refugees.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will bring the day that these churches completely close even closer, for most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the direction of Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boikot from retailers in 125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who didn't want to appoint or promote blackmen.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillion.
David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the kariljon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the kariljon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an unreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carilon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been playing at St. Martin's in the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the licky eggs of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council, the congregation's control body, consisting of licky eggs - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "going to transfer the costs" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complain about a lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark injured 13-year-old on crofting dive in California
A shark attacked on Saturday a 13-year-old boy and injured when he dived for lobster on the first day of the lobster season in California, said officers.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shilling for help and then cut with a group closer to helping him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first curfew, but then he realized 'that he called,' I was bited!
I'm bited!"
His whole key leg was openly broken," Hammel saw when he came out to the boy.
'I cried that everyone should come out of the water,' there is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flyed to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which species of sharks are responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media training session that a shark was noticed a few weeks ago in the area, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the upper part of his body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planned extension to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams fighting with department store-type beauty courses Managing by specialist assistants.
As part of a large expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and houseware recounters, the larger beauty courses will be tested in 11 shops across the country and if it is a success next year to more shops.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets are searching for ways to fill shafts once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's says that it will double the size of his available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will for the first time include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more place with trademark specific areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also again launches its Boutique-grimming series so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that all younger buyers demand.
In addition, the parfuum retailer, The Fragrance Shop, will test consessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first one last week opened in Croydon in South London and a second that will later open in Selly Oak in Birmingham this year.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local comfort shops means that supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the shops are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain is trying to fight back with more services and non-food products against the deposit stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's had put Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since it had purchased both these chains two years back, which, according to their herbal goods sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint business with Boots in the early 2000's, but the relationship was terminated after an argument about how the profits from the pharmacies should be divided into its shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 shop pharmacy for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive series of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said, "We transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty passages to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be right to give advice.
Our series of trade names are designed to provide every need and the appealing environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now an area of beauty destination that makes the old way to shop out."
Peter Jones 'woeding' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones walked away 'would' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrawn her from a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle trademark business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their houseclothing-and-accommodity trade name, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning Provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she withdraws her.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle trademark business at the last moment - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "wrong" when TV's gold girl Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that she can't spend enough time on their home clothing and accessibility trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled according to dedicated Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, on Instagram, announced that she left Truly, Jones climbed on a radiator and exchanged Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's biggest priority at far away.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was absolutely stupid to all involved.
No one could believe on Tuesday what was happening, it was so close to the release.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters, which is right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning Provider, one of Britain's stars that cause most money to flow into, the company can hunt millions out of the pocket because of the huge investment in products stretching from kissings and candles to clergy and house clothes, and the possibility that its release can encounter even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple hold together holidays and Jones own a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is going to become a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard words 'and then get us in love'
He mocked about criticism he'd get from the news media because he made a comment that some would view as "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
said Trump in his kamma-"new reader voice."
"I didn't give up."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a great step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament burned.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday, more than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "consistent response" of the U.S.A. on North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S.A. continues with sanctions aimed at persisting the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic impact in his convention talk.
"We advance excellently with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have resulted in positive results - it has ended firepiece tests, helped to liberate hostages, and caused the remains of U.S. soldiers to be brought back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to come into 'this stampful arena, we would have had almost 200 people standing just there," said Trump as he pointed to the crowd right before him.
Thygolf and earthquake devastate in Indonesia, hundreds of death
In the pursuit of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign nongovernmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite to catalize international aid.
"In many cases, they were very clear that they weren't asking international help, which makes it a little difficult," said I. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is working together a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia constantly endures, the country remains sadly weakly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsuna refugees were built in Aceh, it is not a general sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning syrene in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning of power.
It is best challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Wido made the improvement of Indonesia's painted infrastructure a core point of his election campaign and spent cash on roads and railways.
However, Mr. Yoko’s administration is treacherated by funds shortages as he reselects next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of sloating sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim power accepted a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced like Christian and Muslim gangs with capmeses, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons fought on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge shook good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premierliga loss against Chelsea with a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri told Sturridge when he was about 30 years away from the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before he kicked far to the target stake.
The attempt sailed high over the frame as it swept to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga dumbled and fell in the net.
"It was just to try to come in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq play always forward as far as I could, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edge coming and once typing and didn't think too much about it and just shook."
Chelsea was at half time 1-0 before the Belgian star Eden Hazard recorded a purpose in the 25th minute.
The Blues' target head played in that playroom with a backhead again to Mateo Kovacic before he was tolerated near the middle field and came into the Liverpool helmets.
Kovacic quickly received and presented in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward-head he then led into the frame for Hazard.
Hazard passed the defense and ended with a left foot-shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farest target net.
Liverpool runs the fight against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea arrives on Thursday to stand in London in the UEFA Europe League at Videoton.
Deathtal rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death count in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, said the country’s disaster agency early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped under the garbage of buildings that caused the earthquake, which had beaten Friday at a range of 7.5, and caused burners from up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its over 3,80,000 people, was sown with the ruin of collapsed buildings.

Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes the latest memorial with ‘rewrite of history’-twiss
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "soundness" and "a attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitably in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the shape of Oliver Cromwell would become a target outside the Palace of Westminster.
The sculpture of the English civil wars was neither commanded by Cromwell nor executed.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's manifold representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the writing of a figure that is believed to be still worthy of memorial.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is a totally accurate representation, the subject of continued historical debate.
What is established that the conflict of the mid-17th century formed the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and anniversary."
Killer Pig Crack Chinese Boer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China according to local media reports.
The man, which was identified only by his of, "Yuan", was found with a halted blood-covered arteries near a cake at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai province, China.
According to reports on Wednesday, he traveled with his cousin of the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pig.
He said there was a great male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation, according to the report, confirmed that the 550 pound pig killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and crushed," said the cousin, who was called on his of, "Wu," quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A Mark manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are said to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although weird, cases of pigs that have been attacking have been reported before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pound-swink had tied a Whale farmer against his tractor until his wife scared the beast.
After a farmer of Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer of Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "sneller".
"They're just playful.
They're pinks, very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You must only show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Res from Orkan Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwestern United States.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flood rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had sunday from 5 a.m. eastern time winds of 85 mp.h., a category 1-orcan, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to take shape over the Pacific and move eastward to the west coast of the USA. As Rosa Monday approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity northwestern the southwestern USA in.
Rosa will bring rain of up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity in response to the approaching trough will bring widespread rainfall over the coming days in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches will rain dangerous fast floods, waste flow, and possibly cause land spills in the wilderness.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall rates from up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most parts of Arizona.
Kits floods may be with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to take it in the wilderness at foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep clusters to touch devastated rivers, and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trog will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall total numbers of more than a half inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth rice.
It will be the first rainfall of the wet season.
Some widespread tropical rain showers will begin to Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rain gets widespreader Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread Tuesday to the Four Angle and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S.A. as the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropics remain very hot.
This sometimes results in dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central USA is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, stunning summer heat will try to rise and expand.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern USA will begin warm October, with widespread 80s from the southern plain to parts of the northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees [80 degrees] on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees [10 degrees] above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher probability of over-measured temperatures for the eastern USA for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people look at board Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks at the thrilling testimony of the Supreme Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who charged him of a sexual assault that reportedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political dead point continued, with broadcasters who interrupted regular programs for Friday's on-the-nipper-use: an agreement reached by Arizona-senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate-Journal Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was in drunkenness and tried to pull her clothes out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, he said he was 100 percent sure that it had not occurred.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as large as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts Kavanaugh's appointment strongly supported, were all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.2 million, said Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flakes were the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he went to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS on Friday morning where objectors shouted on him when he tried to take a lift to a judicial committee.
He stood a few minutes with snatched eyes while CNN lively imagining how he was said badly.
"I stand right here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
There was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and had gone before the elevator door, said that he would have said more to the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all later covered living hours when the Legal Committee would vote for Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a voice.
But Flake said that he would do so only with the mind that the FBI would look at the accusations against the candidate for the next week, as the Democrat minority requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat-senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the voices to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump introduced a FBI investigation after the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of ‘political game’ about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political playery" with Britain's future and the undermining of national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May arrives on September 29, 2018 for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview next to the one with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former minister of foreign affairs continued Boris Johnson with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should invent each other's rates was "heartly ridiculous".

Vulcan spit as in Mexico City
As from the Popocatepeti volcano spit, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital reached.
The National Center for Ramp prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after recording activity in the crater and registered gas and as in 24 hours 183 releases.
The center monitored multiple thorns and shakes.
Images on social media showed how thin layers of gas cover motor windscreens in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Gephysicians have marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which has been sitting 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a range of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflicts with Catalan separatists before commemoration of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence demonstrators conflicted with unlustepolish, and thousands joined countertreatments to memorize the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising voice for stigation.
A group of masked pro-separatists that were held back by a disturbance police exploded them with eggs and thrown powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually wept from tourists.
A stove also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their knuppels to keep the fighting in toom.
Over several hours pro-independence groups sang "No forgets, no forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionists' shouting of "Lank Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the processions reported the local press.
The tension continues to run high in the independent region a year after the referendum of October 1 by Madrid was considered illegal but was celebrated by separatist-Catalanes.
Electors overwhelmingly voted to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against ignition that largely boicoted the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried in violent conflicts to prevent the mood from continuing at the voting places throughout the region.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday overnight to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who had attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we spent one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry of joy because they could vote but now stuck us," he said.
Despite a vital but nails' victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties have difficulty maintaining momentum, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-founded exile or in predecesses for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanism that took up the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was driven by politicians on both sides.
"It becomes more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre - hearing arrest since late last year, announced that he would be standing next year in European parliamentary elections.
"To stand as a candidate for European elections is the best way to disapprove the deterioration of democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car fasting home

A crossbow may also have been shot to the car at a time.
Menga target gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston assures victory
Advanced Livigston amazed Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s purpose proved the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerrard's team stayed in the Premiership that season without a wipe and came to stand next week before the ancestors Heart, which are their eight points.
Rangers are hosted for Rapid Vienna in the Europeliga until Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their unconvinced lone in the division to six matches, with chief trainer Holt who still didn't have a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston plays opportunities for bot visitors
Holt's team must have gone ahead long before they had signed a purpose, with their circular breasts, which rangers took all kinds of problems on the neck.
SR broke through, but wore in front of the target cage, then AL could only play wide after he approached and met CH’s headkeeping across the target cage.
The hosts were pleased to play Rangers before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with killing moments.
And thus the decisive purpose came.
Rangers lost a release and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to shoot and to sign a purpose from the middle of the frame.
By that point, Rangers had dominated, but could not penetrate the home defense, and target guard Liam Kelly was largely uncared.
That pattern was continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a turnback from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers' target guard Allan McGregor and Lithgow had widely typed to evade Livingston's open game.
Crosses repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly stopped, while two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were rejected.
‘Fenomenal’ of Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland’s Atlasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal game and results for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they continue to exceed expectations on this upward job.
Their game style and manship have been almost unchanged since their return to first-rang, but Holt comes to a great deal of honor for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was giant with his manifold defense order while Menga kept for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their tones.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as at times under Gerrard, they were unable to maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they could push through the home team, which was somewhat of a cry for Rangers, which they found in middle division.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There were Saturday (September 29) smiles and blue air when leaders from Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO alliances.
They had an outfall on issues that include human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan was then allowed to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted certainty reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from meeting before the mosque but many supporters came up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of their Kurdish – also made their voices thick and both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The fighting demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor greeted by some German Turks as hero and is obtained by others as autocrate.
Deptford road accident: Bicycle driver dies in collision with engine
A cyclist died in a collision in London where a car was involved.
The collision took place around 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-trap in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials work on identifying the man and informing his nearest relatives.
Road locks and bus redirections were instead, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards in riot injured
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, said the prisoner's office.
Oproer broke out around 09:30 BST and is still in progress at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado guards" were called to handle the riot, including eight prisoners and to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor vision injuries.
A prisoner spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been developed to pay attention to a continued insident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six personnel were treated for injury.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay longer behind tralies."
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous wrongdoers.
There was reported in June that the headquarters of the prison received hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, disturbance officials were called to pay attention to serious disorders in which staff with biljart balls were attacked.
Orkaan Rosa Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsfloode (Droogte territories Trek Dalk Benefit)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure hit Arizona but that's exactly what can happen early next week if Orkaan Rosa's remaining energy moves over the southwestern desert and brings fast flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued fast floods for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route over Phoenix, and by Monday will come near with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noticed in a twith that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have preserved tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Orcan Center’s models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogolon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Come, will likely get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated total of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside of fast flood risk, Rosa's rain will probably be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall will probably be beneficial since the southwest currently experience drought condition.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reported Weather.com.
First, Orkaan Rosa’s path leads to approaching land throughout the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane - strong Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets cooler water in the Pacific Ocean, so her strength is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected that she will reach the country Monday in the afternoon or evening at tropical storm strength in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Regular totals from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north over Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border in the early morning hours as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah at late Tuesday evening.
"The biggest danger expected by Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the US southwest," said the National Orcan Center.
It is expected that this rain can cause life - threatening fast floods and ruins in the deserts and ground shifts in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempt to murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested under the suspicion of attempt to murder after a 16-year-old was found with stitch wounds in Somerset.
The injured teen boy was found Saturday at about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officials appealed to anyone who might have any cell phone image material of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'has suffered under the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "under the commonness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and fervently and emotionally a claim of Christine Blasey Ford denied that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her claim during the trial.
The President said Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most qualified legal spirits of our time, a jurist with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican rising at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but actually I'm standing," he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for these candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission to " resist and hinder."
The first important procedure on the Senate Floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, said an senior GOP leadership assistant to CNN.
Hundreds of death due to Indonesian shaking, tsunami, with numbers that continue to rise
At least 384 people were dead and many were washed away when giant waves broke on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said authorities Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on the beach for a festival on the beach when burners broke up to six meters (18 feet) high at sunset on the beach, washed away many after their death, and destroyed everything that was in the road.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-range earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat developed yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and didn't run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster lighting agency BNPB at an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on his own, it took cars, stumps, houses together, it struck everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges that have been distorted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftercocks shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) said in a declaration that the energy released by Friday's giant shock was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "beautiful" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels collapsed.
Some victims were found where they were trapped under the ruins of buildings that crashed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake shaard.
Communication "is completely impeded with no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300 000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, and added that their staff and volunteers were on the way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized Saturday because they didn't tell a tsunami Palu hit, although officials said that the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur image material divided on social media, can be heard how a man on the upper floor of a building desperate warnings about the coming tsunami shouts to the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the beach and wears buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image material authentic.
The shaking and tsunami caused great power interruptions that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending trucks with Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but evacuated ones still need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Wido would visit Sunday evacuation centers in Palu.
Indonesia-tsunami mortality rates rise over 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision’s staff of Donggala arrived safely in Palu City where workers concealed in dexeils founded in their office courtyard, they passed by scenes of destruction, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they had seen many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as assistance groups begin with the tremendous task of launching the disaster lighting task, some people complained that foreign assistance workers with much experience are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and staff from overseas can be started only after the area of the disaster has been declared national disaster territory.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Good, it is a national disaster," we can open it for international assistance, but it hasn't yet a status."
When the second night came on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was taken from a sewage pipe.
Sunday rescue workers had been saved a woman for two days under ruin with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national vals screening team, set up two of the missing turtles for the Asian Games that had previously ended in Indonesia.
Other of those who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the fall screening field I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated under the fall screen-weef society, he despairly sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were answered only with one gray legal mark, instead of two blue legal marks.
"I think it means the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26 750 when refilling OTM by Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole Friday morning $26 750 at a Brink's worker who had refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news statement from the Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car was trying to empty an OTM in a entertainment complex and prepare to deliver more money, wrote detector Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running behind the Brink's worker" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspicions fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the inside.
Anyone with information about their identities must contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Canye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapid Canye West is going to change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote, "The being previously known as Canye West."
West, 41, for a long time had the nickname Ye and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that canceled for "emotional reasons", said the program's manufacturer.
Besides the fact that it is a abbreviation of his current professional name, West has already said in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'yy'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio-provider Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, after just Ye – only the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year his preference for the names Love and Brother Love announced.
A former West coworker, JAY-Z, has also finished with or without a coupling sign and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military against civilians
Mexican newly chosen president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador entered into until the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students promised to never use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to never use the military to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot on October 2, 1968 on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where up to 300 people died in a time when left - minded student movements were posted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexico by giving monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training will move youth to gangs.
U.S. must double AI funds
With China who becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount it spends on research in that field, investor and KI practicer Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government made KI announcements, even shortly the US a total formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced their plan last year: they aimed to be the No. 1 in KI innovation by 2030.
"Dubble the KI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.," said Lee.
The doublement of funds could double the chance that the next big AI performance will be reached in the U.S., said Lee last week in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a KI system that knocked the highest crippled American Othello player and later he was a manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions of the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotic challenge and asked when the next one is going to be, to help identify the next visionary.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government chairs, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential persons from other universities in recent years to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the U.S.I. efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhD's in KI," he said.
China’s State Council issued their Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations share money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a collective centre for artificial intelligence that aimed to involve vennotes from the industry and the academic world and the White House announced the formation of a Ceur Committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has last been under fire for months.
Macedonians vote in election or country’s name must change
The people of Macedonia voted Sunday in a referendum about whether their name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", action that would solve a decade-old dispuut with Greece that blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, who has a province called Macedonia, holds that their northern neighboring country's name represents a demand in the area and refused their authorisation to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he wouldn't vote in the referendum and a boikot campaign had sown doubts about whether the arrival would meet the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote letter read: "Is you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev claimed that it was a prize that could be paid to pursue authorisation for Macedonia, one of the countries that came into existence from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough parliamentary members said that they would accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The name change will require a second-ratedness in Parliament.
The state’s election commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
But the rise was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the final parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered electors voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a elector in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko bring their voices out for the referendum in Macedonia about the change of the country’s name that will make the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small hole and approached chairs for tents set up by those who go to the referendum boikot.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor land, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favor of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he gave out his voice.
He said a "yes" result would be "assignment of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute of Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey, carried out by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, rising must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A return in the referendum will be the first serious return for the policy of a pro-West government since the government has taken over last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero Navigates through entire Brighton Defense for Purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy during his purpose in the 65th minute.
The Argentine target head received a one at the beginning of the series at the middle field.
He hurried between three Brighton defenders before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He snatched by one defender before he crossed several others on the edge of the Brighton target.
He then pushed an ane to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English predictor used his first touch in the corner to send the ball back to Aguero, which used his right foot to knock the Brighton target guard Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggled with problems with his feet," said City manager Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We are happy that at that moment he registered a purpose."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga struggle.
The purpose came in the 29th minute.
On that game Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball next to the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling to the farest target angle.
The Sky Blues’ predictor shot the ball in the net just before he was over the rear line.
City takel Hoffenheim in Kampioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make funeral against Rockies
With the Nationals who are from the playback, there is not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to take up the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playback implications for the Rockies, which have a one match advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least a promotor switching place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday evening, but still wants to fix their first division title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least play the contest knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point of I will face this year.
Why would I not want to participate in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but they are reportedly favorable to throw Scherzer into such a situation.
Scherzer, who was going to have his 34th, had a throw-up session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest-Sonday.
The Washington right handy is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outsales in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his High Court Choice Board Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican rising at the mid - term elections.
"All that we did is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big – I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I fight all over these candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "A man sees this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, one sees it happens now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible way, one sees the commonness, the genius.
They don't give to whom they hurt, whom they should walk to gain power and control, that is what they want, power and power, we will not give it to them."
Democracy, he said, is on a mission to "stand and hinder."
"And a man saw it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "wrath and common and genius and false."
He referred to the name of Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received hard bowls from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you lend the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I wait one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to put me under censure, it wasn't quite a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Workers Party LPs to whom we were told we were not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she was in a fearless way up against anti-semitism.
In my case, the motto of censure criticized me because I was different from Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues about which Jeremy had differed with previous leaders.
The notice to the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Workers Party LP, that was exactly what Friday's AR meetings were.
Sadly, this is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of "friendful, more kind" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It became increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated within the Workers Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political outlooks, I began to expect to make an U turn and take positions that I would never have agreed otherwise – whether about national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there's a tyre of skelling on social media that asks me not to be reselected, disapproval of politics from the core and telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And that’s not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed to me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who perpetuate a flood of sexualist or racist insults every day, but never shake away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Workers Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules the party becomes tighter.
I have had a lot of advice for the last two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so pronounced and that I'll be "old" then.
But I didn’t go into politics to do so.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher government's neglect that literally left my state high school decayed, I tried to fight for better public services for those who need it – whether as a local council member or government minister.
I never concealed my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused at any time about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the mosie Friday, I can only say that with the country that sends off to a Brexit that will damage all households, businesses, and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my electors, whether they are now members of the Workers Party, I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being reselected or political advantage will keep me from doing what I believe in you all are the best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconventional Ayr bo
Two late threes may have pulled the final outcome slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr has deserved to win in this wonderfully delightful Tennt's Premiership contest of the day.
They are now at the top of the score, the only unoverwritten team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, who wore the home team and trainer Peter Murchie has all the right to be content.
"We have been tested so far in our contests and we are still inconsiderate, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "See to Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, targeted by Frazier Climo, made that Ayr was before, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot registered an unintentionally three.
Climo had increased Ayr's prize with a penalty head just before he, just before resting time, intended a solod drie to make it rest time 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, targeted by Baggot, reduced the backstand to five points.
There was a long stop for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott that was carried on a portable, and from the beginning Ayr increased the prize with a Stafford McDowall-three, targeted by Climo.
Ayr's perceptive captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose used the extra player with an unintentional three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson had found a yellow card because he had taken to Clamo without the ball, and from the penalty line MacPherson put the ball to death behind the coming Ayr-lost meal.
Climo meant it, he also had done almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe had received David Armstrong's target head and flirted Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star seems to be approaching new career in restaurant business
It seems that Still Game star was moving to the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was assigned to be the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with old comedemot Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the last of the program, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for life to Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment, although a source suggested at the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "florating restaurant business".
'The sea is ours' 'land rings Bolivia hope court will reopen away to Pacific
Sailors patrol a mesh-covered fleet quarries in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca More to the Amazon are placed with the slogan: "The sea is right to ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the land ringing Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – necessity to ride the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest that it was in decades, while Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court on October 1, after 5 years of discussions.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and obviously expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH speech on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia's claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign pass to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president – which next year faces a controversial struggle for re-election – also depends many on Monday's ruling.
"We are near to return to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor — and that few will change if it would.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to accommodate Chilean territory and stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's pronunciation is only six months after the last bet shows that the matter was "not complex," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s case, it may have slowed down in the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been purchased by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric plucked any remaining Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume discussions at a time, but it will be tremendously difficult to carry on next discussions.
The two countries exchanged ambassadors last in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile" and an opportunity to "an end to 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin-American's most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crack.
Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless their U.S. can trust.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a meeting in Singapore between the rival countries' leaders.
His comments follow to U.S. state secretary Mike Pompeo apparently is on the edge to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead point, more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream image" that continued sanctions and US caption to a statement that the Korean War has ended will also bring the North on its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the statement without Pyongyang taking significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second consultation.
But there is widespread skepticism over whether Pyongyang is serious about doing away from an arsenal that the country considers the only way to guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump consult.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest series of large main coverages on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or totally turn away the sun, you do not need to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of lawn overwhelming main covers at their SS19 collection on the walking board that adorned the style at Paris Modeweek.
Extremely unpractical hats passed through this summer of Instagram, and these designers prepared their astonishing creations on the loopplank.
The outblinker by Valentino was an overwhelming beige hat with a featherous wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other vast additions included laundry lemons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat and even a pineapple – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bistar masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had finished lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation seemed like scubathery, with a snorkel and divebril, while another looked like a melted ice horn.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Style viewers predict that the huge guard may be on the way to the shops near you.
The great hat follows shortly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractical hat spread over social, sent another great creation over the loopplank – a straw-strand bag that was almost as big as the swim-broeked model that wore it.
The burned orange raphiasak, finished with raffinages and finished a white leather handle on the top, stood up at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Known stilis Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big guards and beach bags appear in stores for next summer – since the designer made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for overwhelming attendant.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a rhythm of academic excellence, and it was continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community companies.
With over 30,000 schools throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their schoolers and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their schools for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people of other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages at the top of the liga tables are the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of schoolers who studied foreign languages obtained a higher degree A.
The data, gathering of SCIS's 74 members schools showed that 72 percent students obtained a higher grade A in Mandarins, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who study Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now, as a professional choice, have the same prestige as the STEM cases (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' kurrikula and elsewhere.
A survey by the United Nations Commission for Professions and Skills found in 2014 that some of the reasons that provide employees why they are struggling to fill posts are attributed 17 percent to a lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills are increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more likely work opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, in the future they will have a real benefit with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically place above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent couldn't speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is now so important to invest in today’s language education.
To know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will have a better chance to get meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught that is considered essential for the UK when viewed ahead for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and fit children with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied at this point, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, so it must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages must really be viewed as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
You might be fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make Sunday debut for San Diego Lakers
The guard is almost over for followers to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James would play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego in Sunday's early season opening contest.
But exactly how many minutes he is going to play is still to be determined.
"It would be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell told James that James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier last week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers's six matches in the pre-aison program.
"I didn't need at this point in my career for seasonal matches to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a fleet of elections this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five scorched gatherings in the next week, including stopping in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote that is currently held for his choice to fill the professionals in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the coming interference because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voted in November.
How late is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online at it?
Trump's gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia, has been planned for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can look below through living streaming to Trump's gathering in West Virginia.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the appointed to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who had become tense about accusations of sexual misconduct with an unexpected confirmation voice that was held back for a week while the FBI investigated.
However, the main viewpoint of these exaggerated gatherings is to help the Republicans standing before difficult elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign said that these five gatherings were aimed at visiting "voluntary and supporters, while Republicans tried to protect and expand the majority they had in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Regarding the Congress is so critical of its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to be called his name, to Reuters.
Tonight's gathering, arranged for the Westbanco-Arena in Wheeling, can supporters draw from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time the last month that Trump West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to help the Western Virgin Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrise, who is behind according to the voice patterns.
"That's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him a push at the voice bus," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryderbeker 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday’s single game
After three unilateral sessions, the four teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder cup needed.
The swinging slinger of momentum is an altogether enchanted sports concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like that.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went forward with six points and now it is four, so we carry it as a little momentum, I count," said Jordan Spies when he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead, and twelve more played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spyth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there are many to encourage them, not least the class of Spyth and Justin Thomas, who played together the whole day and recorded each three points from four.
Spieth was deadly from the top to the clean field and leads through his example.
Those scorn celebration screams had become harder as his round progressed and he had sinned a critical set to win four completely equal while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two behind.
His sethold who won the game on 15 for them was greeted with a similar shout, the kind that tells a man that he believes that the American team has another chance.
"You should really just take out everything and worry about your own contest," said Spies.
That is all that those players have now left.
18 wells to print their stamp.
The only players who have more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indispensable story of the Ryder cup.
Europe’s unparalleled but tasty couple got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not keep one about the number of tracks on Saturday afternoon, but they also held one about the number of tracks on Saturday morning as well as during the back nine Friday morning.
That locust, and the way they seem to flow energy to and from this bundling crowd, confirms that they are the players to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari that can sound a potential European victory when the sun over Le Golf National falls.
Prefer both at once or at different wells.
It is still too early, however, to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short meters with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four - ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One keeps over track and two doubles on the front nine, the Spanish and the Swedish landed into a hole from which they couldn't even come from.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and four-play teams are so thrilling to watch from close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change into an eye.
Europe has always played better than a team and has taken meaningfully the lead on the last day, but this four-play session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage for the struggle that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 before during the last day of the Ryder cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder cup after they came with a spring of 10-6 from Saturday's four-ball and four-game games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to keep the trophy that they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team who had unequally paved in the morning's four balls, so that they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the four games and won two contests, but they did not shrink the back.
Jim Fureich’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single - game games to maintain the throfee.
Fleetwood is the first European newling who won four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in the history of the Ryder cup, which has recorded four points after their first four contests.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they played excellently together to conquer a pap Woods and American newer Bryson Dechambreau with an even convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliantness but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning's four balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 layer for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka-- which is first and third on the world ranking.
However, on a pleasant day with a little southwest of Paris, Europe did not always get their sense.
Jordan Spieth who won three times a big tournament and Justin Thomas put the mark on Saturday for the Americans with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four games after losing the first two wells.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder cup a team recovered from a back of four points when they enter into the single game, even though Fureich's team only needs to play equally to keep the trophy because they already keep it.
After they were second best for two days, however, they do not seem to have a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will 'determine' unilaterally disarmed without confidence.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions intensify their distrust from the United States and that the country will certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho said to the world body's annual General Assembly that in the last year North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site, and promiseing not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We see, however, no corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"With any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will certainly not disarm ourselves one-sided first."
While Ri repeated famous North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance against a "phased" approach to removing nuclear weapons that would be rewarded by the progressive action of North Korea, his words seemed meaningful because it did not unconditionally reject nuclear weapons as Pjongang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a president of the U.S.A. and a North Korean leader on June 12th in Singapore when Kim took over to work for the "Destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised warranties for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to have a formal end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pjongjang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests for strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. urges the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of sanctions to reach their goal in a forced way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The pestilence that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions worsen our distrust."
Ri hadn't said anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader had put the attention to the United Nations earlier in the week.
Rather, the minister focused on three meetings during the last five months between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue was about destruction of nuclear weapons South Korea and not the U.S., the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead point."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's fire arrows would be directed to the U.S.'s land mass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump for Kim called a "firm pileman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to destroy North Korea "heartedly," Kim praised abundantly for his courage because he had taken steps to disarm, but he said that much work had to be done and that sanctions still have to remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
Wednesday Trump said that he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the steps they have taken.
But, U.S. minister of foreign affairs, Mike Pompeo, said Thursday to the UN Security Council that "Application of sanctions by the Security Council must zealously and without delay continue until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to dry up funds for Pjongang's nuclear and ballistic missionary programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterward said that he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea this year three times, but his last trip there was not good.
He left Pjongang in July and said that progress was made, but North Korea only accused him hours later of putting "bendelike demands".
In a meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to break off a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States "consistent measures" took.
He said that Kim told him that the "consistent measures" that he wanted to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalisation of relationship with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course about enough rest
A new course at the Harvard University this year let all his predecessor students get more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of study by refusing coffee-driven 'heelagnations'.
An academic found that students at the world's top university are often inconsiderable when it comes to the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medications at the Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at the Brigham and Women Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the U.S.A.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep withdrawal on learning.
'At the end of it one girl approached me, and said, 'Why do they tell me it first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her how important sleep was--which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, presented for the first time that year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at the Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university had decided to enter the course after it was found that students had been seriously taken asleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a sleeping room, where students on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books must be clicked to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleeping deficiency and the importance of a sleeping period.
In another section participants are told how long-term sleep losses can increase risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourage participants to think of their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know-- just as you have the right to know the health impact of cigarettes to choose,' said Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride to study 'heelday' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleeping is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said-- even to avoid having weight, because sleep impairment puts the brain in a starving mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after he ran one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to work him for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effect of 'blue light' that is radiated by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circular rhythm and can lead you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Purpose of Menga conquering Gerrard’s men
Rangers experienced another sarsion of dayhart when Dolly Menga's target head Steven Gerrard's disobedient team got a downfall of 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1-sevene to St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team had just lowered Gerrard's second down in 18 competitions as manager so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which had been unhanded in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga slept seven minutes before resting time, and it didn't seem that a Rangers team without much inspiration would play.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on a target difference.
And there could be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown away from the side.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr to the final battle of the Bethfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that last week took a point of Hearts and he would have been in his nobles with the way his well-trained team had smothered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ballbeats, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should actually have recorded after just two minutes when Menga’s first deposit Scott Pittman passed on to Allan McGregor’s purpose, but the middle field player opened his great chance.
A deep captivity by Keaghan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halkett but his defensemate Alan Lithgow could only snatch wrong at the back stake.
Rangers took over control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to have a penalty target at the quarter when he and Steven Lawless conflicted, but the divorce judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was hardly plagued by Lassana Coulibaly's headboat and a mak target head of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of the game, no one can deny that they have earned it, even though it is just for their hard work.
Rangers once again didn't handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple rounding.
Gerrard acted at the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had a nearly immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett, which collapsed long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their prime in the last stages, but McGregor was well up to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come in wide from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a penalty head when he got through Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from our Sunday morning almank: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and US TELE VERDER... the day when the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geigerteller.
Since then, the Geigerteller was a support pillar of science, and it has also become a support pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 role "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms given by radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Good, it's cracking about!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see robber cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill robber cells
Immune system is learning to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Metod involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changes in a laboratory
They can then see a protein 'see' which is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A proefficient shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, learning the immune system to identify robber cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappearing for over 18 months.
The method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing it into the laboratory so that they can see a protein that occurs in many cancers and are called HER2, and then to inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancers," including breast-, ovarian, lung- and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to remove immune cells from patients and to "lear them" how to attack cancer cells worked to knock a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began after his action on SNL with a pro-Trump ridiculous speech, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was released during a Saturday Night Live in the studio after an enlarged action in which he believed the U.S. president Donald Trump and said that he would prefer him in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, and during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he sailed out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and they're, "How can you like Trump, he's a racial?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from America long ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not broadcast, the image material of West’s shaking was loaded by the comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to ridicule West by putting it.
West also complained at the audience that it was difficult for him behind the stage for what he wore on his head.
"They collapsed me behind the stage.
They said, 'Cause going up with that hat.'
They fucked me!
And then they say I am in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West went before, "Would you see the low place?" and said that he would dress his "superman's garment, because it means that you cannot tell me what I should do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
At least twice his comment attracted an excursion to the audience and members of the SNL roll division seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication, "The whole studio has become silent."
West was introduced as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rhythm clother Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who propagated: "To one of the most courageous spirits: DANK YOU ARE STRATING THE SKARE."
But chatspp-program gas woman Karen Hunter made that West was merely "who he was and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose to reward someone NOT (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I believe I accept an ideology and proclaim what threatens my community.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhythm clother on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the being that had previously been known as Canye West."
He is not the first artist who changed his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, wide music legendary Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones-Star Kit Harington criticizes toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his swording role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel tough to be respected.
Kit talked to The Sunday Times Culture and said he said he said 'has walked something wrong' and asked how to handle the problem of toxic male in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonably strong' about working on this issue.
'I feel personally quite strong about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with maleness?' he said.
'What did our men learn while they grow up with regard to the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth of toxic maleity because of its extreme male characters.
He continued, "What is inborn, and what has been taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions in our time-- how do we change it?
Because something apparently went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he wouldn't participate in any of the Game of Thrones-contributions when the series next summer comes to an end, for he said he was 'clear with battle fields and horses'.
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a film manufacturer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here to,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lovely interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-crowned fantasy series.
The couple married on the site of Leslie’s family country estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that there was a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 8,20,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported alone in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, representing a change of the past.
Traditionally, HIV rapidly spread through some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have acquired HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officers said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 10,000 people.
HIV transfer by sex is a critical matter in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003 China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to make the matter work.
Maxine Waters denied that a staff member made GOP senators' data leak, condemned 'threatening lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters sailed out on Saturday against claims that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the accusations were driven by "ultrajuste" experts and web sites.
"Laughter, lies, and still horrible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The selected information reportedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on-line Thursday, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's trial on the claims of sexual misconduct against the appointed to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the placements is related to Waters' office and made known the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is totally untrue and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been put in danger because of this deceitful and false claim - was by no means responsible for the outlet of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon attracted criticism online, including former white house press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It indicates that she didn't have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ reaction to the Democrates ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of seemingly angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tried to light waters in the interference from the cushions, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if this is true," he twitched.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement centres of these deceitful claims.
'We will make sure that the managers are exposed,' she continued, 'and that they will be legally accountable for all that they do is destructive and dangerous for every member of my staff.'
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - flou Rowan Atkinson Spying Spotty
It is now traditional to look for Brexit significance in any new film with a British intake and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy of spottery ranchise - which then started with Johnny English in 2003 and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-kicks evenatire be on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new export event?
In any case, the uncollapsed Johnny English with his peuloos and rubber face had his license to waste everything up for the second time--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film hearings.
He is, of course, the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his sacred pretension to sophisticated elegance a little of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good skut of that old who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire-theme song at the open-spokenness of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, which lets chaos behind him, which Atkinson played once in the now forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of YES.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval pantser garment, and the screw sheets were cut shortly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown but the humor feels rather faint and odd, especially when the "serious" movie trademarks such as 007 and Mission Impossible now itself comedy with self-confidence uses as an ingredient.
The humor feels that it is aimed at children rather than on adults, and for me, Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent cloaks in the persona of Bean.
The eternal themetic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cuber cracker infiltrated Britain's super secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, until the distress of the agent to service--a lamentable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a blown up and besieged character, which already experiences a total collapse of political impopularity: Emma Thomspson do her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's only few in the text to work with.
Her intelligent advisers inform her that since every active spies were at risk, she must call on someone from his retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English itself, now in service as a teacher at some delicate institution, but that from the record from giving lessons about how to be a secret agent, there are some nice jokes here when English offers a School of Rock type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency command and is reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, once again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married with a diving boat commander, an allamapstic role in which too little of Vicki Pepperdine is expected.
So the Batman and Robin of all of it in Her Majesty’s secret service are completely waste again and come to Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the dangerous enthusiasm of the charismatic technology billion who claims to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey from ridiculous escapades: mummed as cherries put them a French restaurant in fire, they cause chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxurious yacht; and English makes pure anarchy break loose when he attempts to use a headpiece for virtual reality to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is saved, but as nice and bundling as it may be, the whole affair is quite a bit like child-TV.
Reasonably medication.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking, couldn't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to his right?
Work denies that it devises a plan for British to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Workers Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to work a four-day week--but for five days.
The party claims that company base savings caused by the artificial intelligence (CI) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving them extra day.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day weekend--but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that it's at the party's economic agenda and plans to set the country in the favor of the workers will 'pass'.
To be changed to a four-day week was signed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to use the changing economy.
An senior workers party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review will be expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits in to the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker as well as to the party's total industrial strategy.
The Workers Party will not be first to sign such an idea, with the Green Party who promised a four-day work week during his campaign for the general election in 2017.
At present, however, the ambition is not supported by the entire Workers Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said, 'A Fourday work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Skadu-Minister John McDonnell used last week's Workers Conference to explore his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take the power of 'sightless directors' and 'winspers' back to service firms.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire investment since a labourer's government can 'retract' on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on directors of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of businesses in the private sector to employees, who can gain annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change of opinion
The FBI's examination of accusations against Judge Board Kavanaugh had a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week delayed and raised the question whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican sensation. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could set up anything they could change their opinions.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done this?
He was determined, certainly, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require a accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it, "Brett has denied it zealously," continued Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all who she called couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I see nothing newly changed."
What is the World Citizen celebration and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be host to the World Citizen celebration, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizen celebration is now in its seventh year, and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flow to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to make awareness of the opportunity’s real purpose to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen celebration, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World poverty project, an international predecessor group who hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
To get a free card after the event (unless you are willing to pay for a BBP card), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as doing volunteer work, send an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call, or any other meaningful way to create awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to reach his goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "kliktivisime"-- people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twith?
Since 2011, Worldburger says that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers who are committed to "helping children reach their full potential," and promised to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 twite of World citizens.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens as you do, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition become a footnote in history," said the Power of Nutrition-ambassador Tracey Ullman in April 2018 during a concert in London to the crowd.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the general questions on his website who asks "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
said Worldburger, "It'll be a long and hard road-- sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-partial movements in front of us, we will be successful because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is among the artists acting on this year's occasion in New York, which will be offered by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use fleet for "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of Inland Affairs
"If necessary," Washington can leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from landing into the market, including in the Middle East, the U.S. minister of domestic affairs revealed Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works on invitation from the legal government--is a pretext to examine new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to handle them.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not land on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the attendants of an opportunity offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profits who viewed themselves as the "stem of the energy consumer" in the U.S.A.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to the handling of Russia and Iran and noted that it was practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, much or more, to finance and replace fuel," he said as he referred to Russia as a "enkeltalt" with an economic dependent on fossil fuel.
The talks come because Trump administration was on a mission to give the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a hupstoot to replace Russia, far more cheap option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including America's President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pypline project, which, according to Trump Berlin, makes Moscow's" prisoners.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition of the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view evoked counterreaction from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) appealed to the U.S.A. to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kampf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren would consider it "ernstig" to stand as president in 2020, said the senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts' senator, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday she'd consider it "ernstig" to stand as president after the mid-term elections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman at the highest sport," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll seriously consider standing for President."
Warren aired her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town meeting and said he'd take the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm up to my inner concern about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very pronounced in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a two-two Friday, Warren said "Of course we needed a FBI investigation before our voice."
A survey released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own electors do not think she should stand in 2020.
Eight-en-fifty percent of "probable" Massachusetts-choosers said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Two-en-thirty percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he had to stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names that have been discussed to stand in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Prayer said he would officially decide in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV by Donald Trump Convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September.
He was arrested Monday morning and accused of an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, which he went through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who feel the consequences of PTSV and the injuries with which our soldiers return," she told a audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and armies and every other member of the army have given to the land."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of household violence, assault of a woman, interference with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. support challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang or household violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district had submitted a friend-of-the-judge order Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimer in the Grace v. Sessions proceedings submitted by the American Civil Libertic Union against the federal policy in August was not made public.
She said her mate "and his violent gang members boys," she abused her, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was kept in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a large number of U.S. A. applications, as nations who face profound problems with gangs and household violence.
In 2014, the new United States Asian Policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrante appèlles) which allowed immigrants to apply to asylum without the necessary documents that fled from domestic violence.
District Columbia's lawyer-general Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "decades' state, federal and international laws ignore."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications will be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the demand, and such advocacy violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-Journal Law.
Prosecutors further claimed that the policy that denies immigrants would damage the US economy, and it is more likely that their entrepreneurs would become and "necessary work will be provided."
Procureur-General Jeff Sessions commissioned immigration judges in June to stop allowing asylum to victims who flee from domestic and gang violence.
"Asyle is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to relieve all problems — not even all serious problems — that people all over the world face every day.
Hopeful Salvation Efforts in Palu while death count doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly neglecting.
'It feels very tense,' said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her feverful baby boy at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Inhabitants have been seen where they return to their devastated homes, searching for throughdrenched possessions, try to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 range of shocks, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who got a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's army hospital where patients are treated outside because of constantly strong afterclocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells about the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-storey hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the walls' ruin, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and added that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'advertising' with 'propaganda advertisement'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily that prizes the mutual advantages of U.S. China trade, the U.S. ambassador for China Beijing accused of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US-President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the China Daily's paid inset in Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa's newspaper with most sales – after he accused China that they had mixed into the US Congress elections of 6 November, a complaint denied China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, marked what US officials said to Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington were currently caught in an escalating trade war that led to making tariff rounds equal to each other's imports.
China’s recompensation rated early in the trade war aimed to strike exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a great exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "enter the bully now by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government grabs America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by posting a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, a man will find very limited absent voices at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing and not see any real reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people have about China's anxious economic trajectory, given that media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers shattered away from the offer to publish his article," although he did not say what newspaper.
Republicins evacuated female choices for interferences with Kavanaugh debakel, warns analysts
While many top-republics at the Supreme Court-genominated Board Kavanaugh stand and defend him in the face of several claims of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see counterreaction during the coming intermediaries, especially of women.
The emotions about this are greatly high, and most Republicans are recorded that they already indicate that they want to continue with the mood.
Those things can't be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s commission for a FBI investigation on the little bit would be enough to approve severe electors.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to Washington, D.C.-Kurant.
Friday morning, demonstrators "November is on the way!" thrilled as they argued in the entry sports hall of the Senate while the Republicans who chose the Judiciary Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the newsyard.
"Men said it was already high; that's true.
But it may be higher, especially under swing-minded voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who do not often vote because they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony outlined the details of her accusation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-genominated, analysts said a counterreaction could follow if Republicans continue to confirm.
"It's been a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice and or Kavanaugh being put on the court, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with some more that choose the latter side.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents surely or likely believe Ford's witness, while 35 say they certainly or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitively yoked during his witness, whereas only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s commission, the FBI is currently examining the accusations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed last week under oath before the Senate’s Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-genominated had uncovered its gender parts to her while they attended a party during their students' years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new Internet to say Google and Facebook the fight
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, leads an initial business that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do this now," he said of the project.
"It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, tunes, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional utilities.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is completely based on the user who can gain access to that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorisation by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralised applications by using the utilities available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about the announcement of a complete change, where all their business models are completely turned overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a posting on medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the Worldwide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past months, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the Worldwide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am greatly optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria cross-spiritual celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I, was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt.kol honourable Bernard Vann acquired the grant in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
But he was killed four days later by a scissors and never knew that he had acquired the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's crowned performance.
According to the London Gazette, lt.kol. Vann led his bataljon over the Channel de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "by very dense mist and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
Later he rushed to the fireline and led the line forward with the "greatest braveness" before he man-only stormed a field gun and knocked out three of the department.
Lt.kol Vann was killed on October 4, 1918 by a German scraper – just more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action is "something I know I can never stand, but something that is humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a crane to the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Jeugorkes.
Michael Vann said that he "beared to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay alert all night to watch the full - packed Bellator 206, just not to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on the way to tell each other the battle, viewers were beaten into the UK when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were impressed after having stayed awake especially for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter described on Twitter the transfer to the child sign picture as "one or other sick joke."
"It is government regulation that the content was not suitable at 6 p.m. and so they had to switch to child programs," Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, said when he was asked about the broadcasting.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company's president Scott Coker said they'll work on their skedulation to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the return, I think we can probably work out something," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it turned over, there were many SMS's sent back and forth and it was not all kind.
We tried to correct it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally make – and we tried to offer more to our adherents and just went over our time.
It's a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with an inferior feeling about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't before he went to high school realized that "not all are like me."
When he talked on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he aired his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that to become a parent, had made him less care about winning at the Olympic Games.
The regular provider of the years of program, Kirsty Young, took down a few months because of disease.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, for "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are less feeling than, and otherwise, the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he couldn't disappoint anyone when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double olympic bronze medal winner became a high profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's Statebond games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he aired his feelings because he is so happy to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that to get in love with a man – US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 – "has caught him on the side."
Daley was married to the Oscar winner last year, who was 20 years older than he was, but said the age difference was never a matter.
"When you experienced so much at such a young age," – he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and low points.
The couple became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "hele perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already had tickets for London 2012 – for he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not in victory," he said.
The following year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed for my life--to dive before my homes at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – who also resonated with him in building to the Olympic Games and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson does not drive and withdraw from Saturday’s Ryder cup
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder ceremony, but he will have to do his form to prevent it from being a unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record--twelfth time in the two-year event, was withdrawn by captain Jim Fureich for Saturday's fourball games and squares.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day in the meantime to be ration leader and work on the exercise bubble at his game in the hope of correcting what is skeleton.
Even at the climax of his career, he was never the straightforwardest driver, so the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National career where the long rumor always punishs the detrimental holds.
And as if the job on his own is not challenging enough, Mickelson comes to stand in his ninth match against the accurate British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who worked together with newer Tommy Fleetwood to win all their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points behind, start the 12 single game games well, Mickelson’s game can be absolutely essential.
Fureich expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a knock on my back, and put his arm around me, and said he'd be right tomorrow," said Fureich.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroes Hall, and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think that he would play two matches.
I put more in the prospect, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the job, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will exceed Sunday Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most of the Ryder ceremonies.
It can mark the end of a Ryderbeker career that never really matched the highlights of his individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 nederlagen, and seven half, although Fureich said that his presence had contributed to the team inaccurate aspects.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, caught, like to screw the crazy, and he's a wonderful old to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him crazy, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just game."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day's single game in the Ryder cup can easily change into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team under the direction of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point jump, but only nails had won with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"A man continues to remind yourself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nails' crap," said Bjorn, on the picture, after he looked at how the Class won Friday 5-3 and yesterday was 10-6 before Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and all to the team that it is not over.
You're gonna be full tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the tips on the board.
We have a purpose, and it's to try to win the throphee, and that's where the focus remains.
I still say, I focus on the 12 players who are in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Delighted about how his players sailed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never go ahead with it.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes back, and it's a horse of another color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there individually, you're tested to your full capacity as a golf player.
That's the message you have to transfer to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind, and he must also put the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furich would want his players to go better individually than they did as gambling partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points from four.
Fureich himself had been surrounded on both sides of that great last-day, where he was part of the wishpan at Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe achieved the "wonder of Medinah".
"I remember every covering word of it," he said in answer when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 talked courageously his players on the way to that last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as was seen at Brookline, as was seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts much stress on those middle contests.
We have set up our team accordingly, and have shared the men we felt, you know, and will bring something magic to us tomorrow."
Thomas received the task of trying to lead the counter attack and faced the main contest against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I chose this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it until the end," said Bjorn about his single game choices.
Germany’s New Warship Reestablished
The German army's latest fregat would have been launched in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, because of incorrect systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The use of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the headship of the splinternue Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregats has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to The Time-Kurant quoting a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the fleet in 2014, but the distressing post-relief issues have plagued this ambitious project’s fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels ordered the fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class fregats.
It is understood that they will have a powerful canon, a battle order of air-absorption and anti-schip missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to develop the latest fregats for up to two years away from home ports.
However, constant delays mean that the advanced warships — which apparently enable Germany to project overseas power — will already be outdated by the time they are in service, called The Time.
Last year, the disastrous F125 fregat made records when the German Navy officially refused to serve the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Fleet sent a ship back to delivery to a shipbuilder.
Little is known for the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is run into a campaign.
Software defects are especially important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – just half of the men's power on older Bremen-class fregats.
It also revealed that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing the performance of work, and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7 000 tons "Rheinland-Pfalz" are supposed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used in World War II by the Germans.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price label for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also touched a question.
It evidently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that have beeted the new fregats are especially important in the light of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy's "ships that can be developed are touching."
The official cloaker said that the issue had worsened over time, for old ships were out of service, but no substitute vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Fleet.
National Trust Listens to Fledermause’s Secret Life
New research is carried out on a estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will throw new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the ordinary and sopranowering bats as well as the brown long-over and Daubenton bats at Invereve Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property in important locations to track batteries throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile recordings using manual indicators.
Expert-class channels of all recordings will check the regularity of the bat crys and determine which species do.
A Habitat card and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat for the bats are the most important and how it is used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and the best way to manage forests for bats and other associated species.
Floor populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have decreased considerably during the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects sleeping and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by home cats.
Fleers are not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo orientation technique to show gambling gas and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly perform recordings and sleeping inspections and sometimes perform rescue.
The organization even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave landgoed in Dumfries and Galloway, home of eight of Scotland’s ten bats.
Country manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the necessity of looking for bats before maintenance in property being done because it is possible that unknowledging destruction of a single cattle site can mean to 400 females and babies' death and can eradicate a whole local population.
Flemish mosquitoes are protected, and killing, disturbing, or hindering, or destroying their sleeping places is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo kills rape wrestling while lawyers prepare to marry German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo made rape robberies against him as "false news" and said that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to marry German news magazine, Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The Portugal and Juventus predecessor was accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the inside, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video in which he speaks his 142 million followers, published hours after the claims, Ronaldo, 33, finished the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is right," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to marry Der Spiegel on the claim, which they, according to Reuters, called "inadmissible reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy."
Procureur Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral compensation for any amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The claimed insident was said to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he supposedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the claimed interior and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" who was left in the stake by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consistent.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an outskirts outside the court because she was "bang for retardation" and worried about being "openly humiliated".
The 34-year-old she says she now wants to reverse the sketch because she was still traumatized by the alleged interior.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged assault on the point of joining from Manchester United to Real Madrid and moved this summer, in a €100 million agreement to the Italian giant, Juve.
Brexit: UK'll repent it forever if their car manufacturers lose
The UK 'will repent it forever' if they lose their status as world leader in car production to Brexit, executive secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "commercial" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it would have to stop temporarily production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a no-contract-brexit can cost posts.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year from which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director at Burnaston.
Other VK engine manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, left fears to leave the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
For example, BMW said that they would close their mini plant in Oxford for a month to Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what motor manufacturers say lead chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line runs on a "only on time" basis, with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption on the border that the business can lead to delays and deficits of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relationships with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid those controls at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to take this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was a very successful set of lead chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped but warned that added costs in the long term could reduce the property’s rivalry and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and the Unite-Union's assembler on the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said, "We proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Adjunk Procureur-General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed "with another week" while the fighting about nominated for the High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia, and possible interboundation of the right by the president.
Whether Trump goes off the Adjunk Procureur-General or not, and thereby threatening Mueller's independence, Washington's skinder toys had been in fire for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, in the midst of reports that he was on his way to quit.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to" for Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate court's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump postponed a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote further.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for that is not yet determined, it can be this week, I can see that it is postponed with all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court with another week.
But we will see, and I always like to keep the press up.'
Some journalists will differ with that statement: Sanders hasn't held a White House press session since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of information sessions is not because of a contradiction for TV journalists who are "effective hunting," although she said, "I will not fight with the fact that they are effective."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, and added without quoting evidence, "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then it is infinite better than to talk to me.
We're trying to do this very much and you've seen it do a lot over the past few weeks, and it's gonna take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignity clerks.
Solo press statements are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and sometimes, bistar appearing before journalists who were there together.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and to express the desire to remain in Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months before withdrawing from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed them to cover costs of handled status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: "In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued on withdrawal, on the way to expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government also intensified their preparations for a possible no-contract scenario.
I know it is for all of you a very disturbing time.
That is why I want to repeat how much I appreciate each staff member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Collegas from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health service work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency operation after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he had suffered a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State Chief Trainer Rod Reed told journalists that the injury had occurred shortly before resting.
"He came to the margin and kind of just there collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
An official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was "not yet any details about the type/range of injury" and Tennessee was still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Butcrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, he took five times to death before leaving the game, which put up his total for the season on 18 death vessels.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to move young electors
The seal tax will be charged on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Thesaurus expects to collect up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to move young electors with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be charged to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional money that will help the government’s plans to counter homelessness.
The extra tax – which is beyond the current stamp tax, including the higher levels set up two years ago to second houses and homes purchased to rent — can be as much as three percent.
The Tesourie expects that this move can bring up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London economists are purchased by non-VK citizens who raise the prices and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "spoken villages" due to the great number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people possess their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping their property prices high by raping up land but not using it and encouraged Mrs. May to distance quotas on affordable houses to restore Britain's "house disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of premature housing improvements, including rental management and an end to "no error expansions".
He also wants to give more powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I will devote my first ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And it means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work, and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as well as foreignly based companies to buy homes as for hardworking British residents.
For too many people the dream of housekeeping has become a deaf dream, and the humiliation of homelessness has become too real."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland-baas Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to be the manager of Scotland at a time.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life in the North-East team, which is currently in the third place in Liga One, three points below the tops.
He moved this summer to the Stadium of Light after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I took the second team, but it was all," Ross told BBC Scotland's sports sound.
"But as a child I often looked with my father for Scotland at Hampden and it's something that draws me back.
However, the occasion can only come if I'm successful with club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic-baas said he felt no anxiety to imitate such established names at such a large club, after he had previously rejected presentations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"On the moment, success will be measured for me by ''I can make this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it certainly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not a easy task to get it there, but I'll probably view myself as successful if I can get the club out there again."
Ross' career in the management is only three years, after a period of time as assistantbaas at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' training staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third liga and St Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he said when he remembered how he took Alloa's leads.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bisar, because I did good enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things by which one must come weekly.
I still go through it as to the stress and pressures of the work, but driving feels just right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable that I was still in my own skin during my whole mature life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 pm on a Saturday, found recording
The summer hot wave improved Britain’s struggling bars’ income but placed more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and barrier groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues were dropped by 4.8 percent, showed numbers.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Advanced sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern than the previous month, June, when drinking places were at 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were even more severe.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only increased in July.
Drinking-trained drinking places and bars did better at far and increased more than restaurants had fallen.
Food-trained drinking places also suffered in the sun but not as bad as restaurant operators
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Over-administered bars and drinking places increased sales by 6.6 percent for the month, with food was finished by three percent."
Paul Newman, of recreational and hospitality analysts RSM said, "These results continue the tendency we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of large social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-the-house out-market.
It comes if no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent years at year will be particularly difficult above and except constant cost pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-guided operators, and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced will bring necessary relief."
Total growth in sales throughout drinking sites and restaurants, including new sites that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the desire for trademark notices.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide them from their parents.
One out of five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that hide them from their parents and teachers reveal a survey
Inclusion of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news increased fears of being placed sexual content
Twenty percent of teachers say they have a "main account" to show parents
One out of five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that keep their secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school teachers revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the photographer Instagram.
The news increased fears of being placed in sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who came down on her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape her."
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of those who admit that they have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "Stim for Athletes" on Scottish Athletic Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the advice of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the control body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-en-veldatleet and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world athletic society and we are certainly athletics in Scotland will benefit much from what she brings to the counsel," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as voice for athletes I and hope I can really contribute and help the sports in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 games in Atlanta under his four golden Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after he had a short-term ice cream attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only the time would learn whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but fully restored, learned again how to walk, and do practices of activity today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Brust pump advertisement that compares mothers to cows to divide ideas online
A Borspomp company has imagined to divide online with an advertisement that compared breast - feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
In celebrating the lead of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choice music video-inspirated advertisement to display the freedom that the pump gives to ma's milking out.
Four real mothers dance in a shore full of straw and cows on the size of a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "If you didn't see, it's not eggs, it's my breasts."
The choir section reads: "Pop it out, pump it out, I carry the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 looks and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed response from viewers, with many who say that it undermines the "grills" of the dairy industry.
"Many poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Nes we must get them pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen of them within days after they have given birth," wrote one.
The Elvie Brust pump fits discreet in a nutrient bra (Elvie/Mother)
Anotherbody noticed, "Reasonably traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertisement is so out of feeling."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman who admitted that the song was "shoutnaaks" for her.
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would have had one if I had still breast - feeding.
To milk out, I felt like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a genial product," wrote one.
Another person noticed: "It's a nice advertisement directed to mothers who milk out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and like "cows".
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bra's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly in a nutrientbra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out as they milk out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a large and excited announcement.
By drawing a parallel between women who milk out and dairy cows, we wanted to demonstrate the milking process and all its challenges in the collar, while in a entertaining way that people can find the wonderful sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump took the news.
During London Modeweek a mother of two appeared on the loop board for designer Marta Jakubowski as she used the product.
Hundreds of migrants quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of maintained migrants has increased sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of high rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children at guarantees.
Traditionally, most of the guarantees were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country is threatened by taking forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible guarantees and other mature members of their households should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and customs enforcement before the Congress witnessed that the agency had arrested thousands of people who applied to guarantee unforgettable minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those who were arrested had no previous criminal records.
"According to 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsored or household members of guarantees, are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That's why we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to cope with the children faster, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status at an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain in arrest, the more likely it is that they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape efforts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in the past months.
Advocates say that these concerns are increased at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more easily considered as a result of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends, the trauma that many already have.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupied forces’ to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN's General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid also called for Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in his eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian ground, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "handled accordingly".
"They should withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, with more than millions who have been displaced, is "amper over".
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight this sacred battle until we purified all Syrian areas" of both terrorist groups and "some illegal foreign presence."
The United States trained and advised about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn land.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrative fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to fascinate this return," he said.
"They polite something that just needs to be a humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomas said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebellion fortress of Idlib created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejected a large attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, emphasized that the agreement had "double sperms" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front that will be "destroyed".
UN officer, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon call together the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to set up a post-war constitution for Syria and set up the way to elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee and said the panel’s work must be limited to the "continuing of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term.
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the reselection in 2020, unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals end his presidentship early.
In what undoubtedly "the most dramatic final of a presidency will ever be!"
Until now, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time view rates have doubled up to 1.05 million at CCN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak-time viewers, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top of cable viewing rates with as many as 3.5 million viewers on large news nights.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran competitor and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", had another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote to Mr. Trump.
She asked.
"He said, 'Why he let me laugh,' she told me.
There is fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Turning off is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet it goes further than to be just an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour of it to see how a panel of experts debates about Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 voluntary-flying-baadje ("a clothing thick of the hubris," said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, anatomy.
For example, I will never look again at Super Mario in the same way.
"Somely he does what makes it feel like a reality program is that he feeds you every evening," says Brent Montgomery, commercial head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role division and daily chinkels in the plot (like looking for disputes with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).

He couldn’t break him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh was on his way to appear before the Senate’s Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scale.
"I remember when we did all those male programs then and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Outside money flows to the most exciting middle-term election race in Home
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees a flow of money, due to a shift of congress districts that now made two officials land in a race to the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district lets Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – which won its seat in another district in a special election last spring – measure powers.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavy overlapping with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old district was unconstitutionally demarcated in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th broke off with a campaign financing competition between the large parties’ financial legs, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nail crap win in a wide-looked special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress district.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts gave some advantage to the Democrats.
U.S. thought of penalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then returning
Diplomates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until vennotes disfellowshipped the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the government departments decided to call back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the "fast decisions to no longer acknowledge Taiwan," said Heather Nauer, the department's spokesman, earlier this month in a statement.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador who received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug management, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including reduction in financial assistance and targeting visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow on a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top-administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue to bring an effective end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Adjunct President Mike Pence is now destined to address the conference, now planned for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new tremendous messages or severe messages from Washington.
A white house spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomas, who agreed to discuss the internal consultation on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that could happen can be the special discussion about Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible cross - linement of the law, of which there are now many significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is probably also focusing on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign worked with Russia in the country’s attack on our elections.
If the Congress would go over in other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face responsibility in that body, just when he prepared to go again before the voters, and maybe eventually before a jury of his peer group.
It's a lot of axes, and with that I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be taken on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched out.
In 1938 German officials were ready to carry out a state grip against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years' slaughter that had followed.
The course of history turns around such turning points and democracy’s uncomfortable course is rushed or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismiss Adjunk Procureur-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein was in hot water since this newspaper reported that he had suggested last year to take the president in secret and speculate whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times’s report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or just – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the intervening election for a conference that will keep Mr. Trump responsible?
If we watch those tests, there's a long winter before democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that lived in my ambassador's home at a time.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to set the Sabbath candles on that table wearing the swastika.
With this as my origin, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistics for Rapid Vienna battle
Rangers play hosts for Rapid Vienna Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equilibrium in Spain against Villarreal once this month will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe Liga.
A knee injury has prevented middle field player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2-equivalent result against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this rash as a spring place for larger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the contest with the conviction that we could get something and walked away there with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but an equal count is probably a righteous result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European evening.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it's gonna be a difficult match, because they had a good outcome in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure I'm able to suppress us and get a positive outcome.
Last year certainly was difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there is a good feeling factor at the place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now be persistent, sitting behind us last season and successful."
Women lose sleep over this retirement pair of money
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talk to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a relative to care for them, but they do not take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide life insurance injuries.
Here is true to begin.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not express your wishes long before.
Work with your advisor and your family to talk where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial adviser in: Your advisor can also help you to come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term financing decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-security with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut down legal battles at the pass.
Get a health care staff instead of so that you instruct a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and to ensure that experts meet your wishes if you can't communicate.
Consider, too, authorized for your finances.
You need to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are inadequate.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent had a medical emergency and was on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details out in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are in question, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medication?
Who Will Care for the Dog?
Make sure that plan is instead."
Man shot in Ilfracombe several times with windbux
A man was shot several times with a windbux when he walked home to an evening out.

Officials described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as an "equivalent act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were dead because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and the death count is expected to rise.
With communication that was put out of action, relief officers couldn't get any information from Donggala rainship, a area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5 range of shakes.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster was struck.
Here are a few key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central-Sulawesi province, located at the point of a narrow bay on the western coast of the Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a rainship that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regentship, a administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the support pillars of the Central-Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami caused more than 200's death and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A Tsunami also hit West-Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A great shaking along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, which led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shocks hit the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 range hit the south of Java, Indonesia most populated island, which led to a tsunami that hit the south coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 range of shakes hit near the city of Padang, capital of West-Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 range of shakes hit one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level of shaking hit the Pidie Jaya rainship in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shaking and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were dead because of buildings that plunged down,
2018: Great shakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The shaking destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily disturbed.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son arrested on charges of household violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of household violence, interference with a report of household violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a female knowledge's phone to her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in arrest at Mat-Su Pre-hearing facility and is held on a $500 unsecured guarantee, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, certainly" when he was asked what he was pleading, the network reported.
Palin faced three class A offences, which means he can be locked up for up to a year and paid $250 000.
He is also accused of a class of B-breaking, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal complaint against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The matter is currently serving before Alaska’s Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of household violence, interference with the report of a crime of household violence, and possession of a gun while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed that he had boiled her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior to PTSD as part of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsoenami: hundreds of died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 range of earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been put out of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just outside the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered together for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors are looking for rare death sentence for suspicion in NYC terreur attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspicion in the New York City terreur attack that caused eight people's death – a rare punishment that has not yet been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, said to have used a Home Depot car rental car to run an attack on a bike road along the West Side highway in Laer Manhattan to reap pedestrians and a cyclist who were in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has "deliberately" killed the eight victims and has given "deliberately" serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intention to ask for the death penalty, submitted in the Southern District of New York.
Both those charges bear possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal great jury struck Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "definite planning and predecession," said prosecutors, and described the way Saipov carried it out as "abhorely, cruel, and perverse."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the intention notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York legally persecuted a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to life - long prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been killed after they were sentenced for a team to carry out spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told detectors that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov said the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after he watched ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently for the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo-advocates representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the persecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than to accept a confession to life prison with no possible release, only the trauma of these events will prolong for all those involved." said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel the "heat" of Euroscepticians – since one of Theresa May’s own LPs suggested he should be in control of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that by the time the UK was "should be out" if Mr. Farage Brexit secretary was.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to unite her deeply divided officers by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise plan in the midst of Brexiteers, Remainers, and the EU attacks.
Bonds insisted that she would press her door in her attempt to join Brussels despite the death – and force Euroscepticians and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Loop Signs Loop-Congress in Solihull that he wanted to evade "Chequers."
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a nobleman and the responsibility for negotiation with Brussels.
‘If he was in charge, we would have been out by the time,’ he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added, 'I'll get up for Brexit, but we have to cut Chequers out.'
He explained his opposition to the EU and said, "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 stemmery: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to stay is totally false.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and said to reporters: ‘ I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not voting for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and make sure that we are first chosen.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: ‘First ministers must keep their work when they keep their promises.’
Mr. Farge told that the convention politicians had to feel the "heat" if they were on the threshold to violate the decision taken in the 2016 reference.
‘It's about a trust case between us - the people - and our political class,’ he said.
‘They try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them ‘We won’t let you get away with it.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit feel the heat.
‘We mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-regulating, proud United Kingdom.’
In the meantime, Remainers had marched by Birmingham before they had held a convention for two hours in the city center.
A few activists wrestled Tories against Brexit-baniers to the announcement of the group this weekend.
Workedelman Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues that they had endured with a party application like the conference opened.
‘It is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus instead, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ he added.
‘It's a total clever.
There's not such a thing as a good Brexit,' he added.

Arrival station made in shooting death of LSU’s Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspicion in the death of LSU basket player Wayne Sims was arrested Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was seen in the image material.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University’s campus.
"Wayed Sims got a shot wound in the head and was finally dead because of it," told police chief Murphy J. Paul the media on 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde entered to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated, and confessed that he was in the scene, in possession of a weapon, and confessed that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton sounds world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes's team commands would play a major role in the races.
From the stake, Bottas had a good start, and almost won Hamilton as he had defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the wells and left Hamilton to drive into the bundle all the way back into traffic, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes took a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-on-wheel action that the Ferrari driver saw reluctantly risk-free the innermost left at risk of endurance to a double-movement to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the back row from the jumping schedule and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led to a large portion of the races as he stuck to his ties to quickly finish and cross Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have come into the wells on the 44th round, but could not accelerate his past in the remaining eight rounds since Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastic all weekend and was a true sir.
The team performed outstanding work to have a one-two," said Hamilton.
It was roughly bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked at a convention on Saturday Senator Dianne Feinstein about her urge that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which his Supreme Court-genominated Board Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the evidence given by Ford before the Senate Rights Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "common and rude and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has gone in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and common and liars," he said.
"When you looked at statements and leaks and then they say." Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer... you've leaked the document-- "o, o, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a little.
We blew it... no, we didn't leak it," he added, in a precaution of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that outlined the accusations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it had been leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leakage had escaped from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president didn't consider her denial good, and during Saturday evening's convention commented, "I tell you what. It was roughly bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-genominated, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, and suggested that the democratics use the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the commonness, the imprisonment, they don't give to who they hurt, who they have to go around to get power and control," Mediaite reported the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday's Elite League's loss against Belfast Giants by winning Saturday the contest 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants received an early two-purpose guidance by throws from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team equally before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ direction.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee alike before two Luke Lundvald Nielsen goals fastened their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who first lost contests and then won Friday evening Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants who won the previous three contests.
Dwyer's open ball came in the fourth minute on 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull aid, with David Rutherford who offered the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took lead until the first break when he threw his second purpose of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again found them equal with a power game target on 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the contest in the second half, and he made sure of the win with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who now lost four of their last five matches are home to Milton Keynes in their next match Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of aeroplane can escape earthquake
A air traffic manager in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane that carried hundreds of people safely stabbed.
More than 800 people were killed, and more is missing after a great earthquake Friday hit the island of Sulawesi, and a tsunami caused.
There are still strong afterclocks in the area, and many are trapped in abortions in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues who had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that severely swept on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained immovable to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was at that time on the runway, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he was day when it collapsed.
Later he died in the hospital.
Vocabulary for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before helicopter Palu reached.
"Our hearts break to hear this," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster despair agency that states that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death count still increases since many bodies are still under the building valves while many cannot yet be reached," said Agentship vocabulary Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that had reached up to six meters, Palu cracked that would hold Sunday a mass funeral.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute brings an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross chase to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's president Joko Wido arrived Sunday in Palu and said to the country's military service, "I ask almai of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok in which over 550 people died.
Micronesia aircraft accident: Air Niugini says one man is missing after beach lake aircraft accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed in a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they couldn't give account of a male passenger.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectors to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers had stayed in the hospital Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come very low.
"This is a special good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through mid - depth water until the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the airguards had become panic and shouted and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that shipowners who worked close to the improvement of a corpse also helped with a reluctant boat with the salvation to get people to land away and again before the plane sinked in about 30 meters (100 feet)' water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in collapse of PNG registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analysts set out timeline from night that woman was burned alive
The state closed his case on Saturday in the rehearsal of a man who was accused of having burned a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S.- Department of Justice-analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence-analyst.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile records to gather the movements of 29-year-old charged Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the evening that his death was.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was together Chambers the evening of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis tells the truth when he said he was in Sanford's dress that night, Sanford said he "jok, because my dress was in Nashville."
And another inconsistency is that Tellis said that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that for a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers removed messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He certainly made her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was planned to start his final seats on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A Hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop moved away from its origin of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip hop again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent rehearsal in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Neither a black person?
NY-children-juffrou marrys couple because she's abandoned to "rasistic" text
A New York boyfriend marrys a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrong recipient message from the mother who complained that she was another black person.
The couple denied that they are racist and compare the thing with "depression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her distress when she learned that the new childcare, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEE NÓG A SWART PERSOON," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to me Maurice.
After she found out her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed me Maurice and said that their outgoing childhood girl who was African American did bad work and that she had rather expected a Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent her home with an Uber.
Now Maurice succumbs the couple for compensation over the payout and searches his compensation to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, resident work she was first appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such things," she told the Post Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the claims that they were racist and said that it was reasonable to end Maurice’s action and fear that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racial.
We are not racist people," told man Joel Plasco the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, though it was by abomination?
Your newborn baby?
Now."
Plasco compared the matter with "depressing" and said that his wife would have had a baby over two months and was in a "many difficult situation."
"Are you going to follow such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," added the investment banker.
As the case continues, the court of public opinion was fast to bring the couple on social media and to cut them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not link readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to sit yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It is very entertaining that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been fervent if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the child book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year was "bitter sweet".
About Paddington, who she described as a "many important member of our family," she added that her father was silently proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an appetite-good man," she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who reached something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your work.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success kind of that way.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to greet the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was hunted to Nice’s Louis Pasteur two hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was real bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heart lamb.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors gave her to keep her heart knocking slowly touched up and left her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it folded.
I couldn't shout or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was hurt by that time for the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers on board the plane--unconsciously she appreciated the trial she had gone.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had sucked my head and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I found on the flight a overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Treuring women mail cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to lead to depression and killed himself at 18.
"I want no parent to feel as I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lived in Lydney, and said that her son was a promising jow with an infectious smile.
"All knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile had clarified any room."
But he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 then, found his brother after taking his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people outside to whom you can go to and to whom you can talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he was sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the most lowest point on Christmas-- when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or something with them."
She said his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it, "It took a hole through the family.
It breaks us apart.
But we must all go and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is still unresolved as FBI investigates
"I thought if we could actually get something as for which he asked--a timeless investigation that had no cover--we might bring a little unit," said Mr. Flake Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was "falling apart" under distant partisan collapse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have had to investigate the FBI?
Their reluctance is all due to time calculation.
The interferences are only weeks away, on November 6, - if, as is expected, the Republicans are going badly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they would prefer to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI delivered his report?
There'll be a mood in the senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come up to at least 50 votes on the senate floor that Mike Pence, the vice-president, will allow to break a equal play and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea Overrun Numbers 'daal' under Kim
The number of North Korean overlopers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to the rule seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong - sigh quoted data from the South’s unification cabinet and said that last year there were 1,127 transfers — compared with 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and Shina and higher rates requested by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The great majority of overlopers from the north are finally offered South Korea citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight through Shina, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to pass over than the highly protected demilitarized zones (DMS) between the two Koreas.
Shena considers the overlopers rather than illegal immigrants than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, who are still technically speaking in war with one another, have significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for conversations that centered around the striking negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historical meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to cooperate for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho has blamed US banks on the lack of progress since then.
"With any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN general meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeries," he says he's inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court
Home minority leader Nancy Pelosi called High Court-genominated board Kavanaugh "histeries" and said that he was temperamentally inadequate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the comment in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help to think that if a woman had ever acted like that, they would say 'histeries'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate-Right Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he almost screamed and struck as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly dismissed Democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "deliberate and coordinated personnel murder," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s evidence proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he had been prejudiced against democrats.
"I think he makes himself inadequate with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to complain to Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and as Democrats won the majority in the Lower House.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be at the Supreme Court, but to be at the court on which he is currently," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Ommegang Appèlhof.
Pelosi added that she was worried as a Democrat about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on Appreciable Sorg or Roe v. Wade since he was regarded as a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh jumped over questions about whether he would throw certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'it's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women must handle it.
It is a righteous diarrhea, months and years of anger that boileth, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was very helpful by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she was crying when she became angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she had become angry and began to cry, she would have said to the person with whom she had spoken, 'You may think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for toom because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest reminders of an early work in a male-dominated office is where I once found that I was crying with no nameless anger and grabbed at my neck by an older woman--a cold driver for whom I was a little afraid-- which dragged me into a reporting hall.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will be happy, because they have had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congress from Kolorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidency campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-eight relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, I realized Schroeder, very frustrated, that there was no reason why she couldn't examine the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Sneevewive and the Seven Dwergies."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with founding collections and so she made a vow that she would not enter the races unless she had gathered $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who had given men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Think they I get off?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions--thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target electors rather than delegate, and angry for the sexism--that she had struck.
You would have thought that I had a nerve crash," recalled Schroeder about how the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporative guarantee.
I remember thinking, what are they going to sit on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
How the US China trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were overwhelming and while the battle is far from over, a conflict between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, says experts.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year by burdening important Chinese exports, including sun panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the most important escalation has rolled in with new rates that affect $200 billion ($150 billion) of items and effectively load half of the goods coming into the US from Shina.
Beijing retarded in goods every time, and recently whipped rates of five to ten percent on $60 billion’s U.S. goods.
Shina promised to balance the US shot-vir-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to pass on to requests, but to meet publicly the U.S. requests would be too much of a embarrassment for Xi Jinping, Shina's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure over U.S. trade war over the long-term Shina can support positively by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could start an economic toll in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than what spectators have previously confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a denker.
Syria ‘ready’ for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and call upon help to rebuild the land that was destroyed by a war for more than seven years.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country improve.
"Today the situation at the ground level is more stable and secure due to progress in getting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore to the normal areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the one - sided economic measures that their daily lives and their existence have enforced.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the land.
But he emphasized that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that guaranteed the invasion.
Europe blessed Ryder cup victory in Paris
Span Europe won the 2018 Ryder cup and conquered U.S.A. with a final point from 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European ground and has not yet won a Ryder cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team took the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, gave her T-hou in the water at the par-3 16th hole and admitted his contest to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari was blooming in all its rounds and has become one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format started in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth was poured out by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Oread of Denmark.

There was this morning when we put a little heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Guard for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder cemetery, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat slipped.
We're excess."
