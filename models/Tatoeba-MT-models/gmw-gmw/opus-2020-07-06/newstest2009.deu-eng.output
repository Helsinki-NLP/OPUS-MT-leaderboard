The Prague Stock Exchange crashes against business conclusion into the Minus.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
At the beginning of the Tuesday business, the Prague Stock Exchange joined the start of Monday when it fell by six more percentage points.
This time, the reason was for the breakdown at Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American Representative House, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case experienced the shares on the stock exchanges in Asia on Tuesday, although the indices were able to compensate some of the losses over the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points over the business day, but later it was possible to compensate some of the losses, so the decline decreased to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observes the movement of Chinese shares on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares on the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent after the index there.
"The timing for the rescue action in the USA is unsure and will affect the financial markets worldwide," said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. regardless of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should return as soon as possible to the negotiating table and adopt the draft for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it was sad that other countries would also be affected by the collapse.
A Blood Bath of American shares
On Monday, the American Representative House rejected the plan for supporting the financial system for which up to 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion Kč) should be used.
The legislators thus ignored the request by President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush's view is that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and therefore help to stabilise the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the largest breakdown over 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped by almost seven percent, a similar breakdown he had recently recorded in 1987.
The index had already dropped before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not come through in the House, the index experienced a free case.
Congress confesses: U.S. government may pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed to a wider form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
This is to be voted at the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators reached a breakthrough of 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion crowns) in discussions about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance for the American financial system.
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
The Congress Members have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system is negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank said this to Reuters Agency.
In the Senate, different information is likely to be voted at the earliest Wednesday on the plan.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first important psychological factor for the strengthening of the financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there is a "energy" because of the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have achieved significant progress.
We have clarified our different views about how a package should look to stabilise the market," said Bloomberg's Democrat Nancy Pelosi Agency.
According to their words, a final vote could be reached on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with the U.S. Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a sale of uncoupling mortgage activities from financial companies that disrupt financial firms into serious losses and threatens the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're at the target," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also clearly in the share markets that are falling strongly.
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the convention.
This is why investors will be calm down before businesses in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision of the Congress could affect businesses on Monday.
However, it has not yet been quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and it is also unclear whether the negotiations in the last minute could not fail to be a problem.
The legislators hope it will be adopted in the next days.
But the law will still experience some changes.
The total amount for aid for the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
However, the Congress can block the payout of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, at another $100 billion and later the final $ 350 billion.
Bush evaluates progress in negotiations positively
Although the President has a veto law in this decision, the Congress can accept its veto.
In spite of these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme has remained based on the acquisition of finances for the sale of bad mortgage cards whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their hypotheses.
"We worked out everything.
The Representative House should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress showed satisfaction also by the American President Bush.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "evaluated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of beneficiaries and a timetable for the financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden case screens for directors of the companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to be responsible for the supervision of the Fund.
This is intended to lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and achieved a great progress towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also expects with help for home owners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgages, which it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea after the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but the implementation becomes very difficult.
"And therefore, because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problematic assets are bought.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," said Marek this week to the server iHNed.cz.
In Marek's view, whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of the next week is not crucial.
"Veel more importantly, the Congress Members agree to support the plan and to adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it comes to adoption is the most important at this moment," Marek emphasized.
Duell on knives cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, there is no MP3 player yet to phone.
That's why it looks like it's better to buy only one phone.
In spite of all, there are enough reasons why you should make yourself an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and claims of the future owners.
Surely, you hardly buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties appear at LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream of at least one of them.
This is also the case with music on travels, i.e. with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
There are also prices and quality categories here.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a pink floyd fan may hardly force headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is widely vulnerable.
The lifetime of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can't even create imitation.
No modern device is used as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephone and simsen, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, once a bader photo device and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more often you will need to download it.
And playing music is one of the largest energy freakers.
Only few mobile phones can play music longer than ten-two hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
That's why you should expect the cheap phones to play music no longer than a few hours.
If you still call occasionally, you prefer to buy for safety another charger for the office - this also applies to expensive devices.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keeping at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one time loading.
Another problem is when you want to play the music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB closure, as well, not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only few card reading devices will be finished with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
You do not need any special software for players until you have exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves provide a music library, ordered by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user's rating.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones can more
In selecting a specific device, you should know especially after the lifetime of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course also the user comfort.
Is music especially for you and hear them every day just shortly, for example, in the roadway, then a phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What can really do almost every cell phone?
You do not have to control the music formats that can handle a mobile phone or a player.
MP3 creates all, and the most music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in the WMA format.
AAC is less common (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to call on the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can acquire a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument for why to create a music handy.
Unfortunately, the offer of the provider is bad and is usually limited to fast radio heats.
Prices are not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of sale of music (see GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will continue to dominate the music industry.
The cell phone wears most of them.
If you like to listen to something, take the phone in the jacket bag while the player forgot to be at home.
However, it is important whether you always wear headphones or at least a wireless freespeaking device.
If not, you can access the integrated speaker, which has almost every phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The most likely advantage of musical handicrafts will be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually costs less than three thousand crowns.
For three- and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest disability will be for most that no normal headphones are involved.
The best and technically mature telephones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is again in the easy operation.
The simplest – and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) – player can really serve everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the operation with the former normal cassette recorder or, for example, the plate player is obvious.
It does not threaten a collision in the form of an irreversible mobile Internet and a horrendous account for data transfers.
After which device you should now take
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) also usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD and etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, there are two thousand crowns.
But respect.
The basic models usually support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irish.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be part of the more demanding listeners, take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the user comfort comes to the individual MP3 player.
Most wide is here Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 player sold individually.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery lifetime (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) offer you MP3 players of the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to Czechia this year.
Maybe
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, and the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there is something missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't wait for a long time.
The fact that the Czech mobile service providers work at the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported on mobile.cz.
This also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price for a SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming fees, there is as likely a paradoxic situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fighting year.
Perhaps it sounds paradox, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile radio providers like to shrink that there is extreme competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who had often said in the past that there was no room for another supplier in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classical provider with its own network no longer has a great deal of opportunities (usually he would hardly find frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
Just the entry of virtual providers to the mobile phone market brought a significant reduction in the price, which then also had to respond to the classic mobile operators.
There were similar votes in the United Kingdom before the entry of such companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile.
However, it has shown that there is space for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you do not need to look for examples for a long time.
In February this we reported about the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus climb to the country's five largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:phone in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual provider is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
To be able to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, but often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half more cheap than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a very good draw to put on a non-slice target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider who likes them and can trust them," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could take foot in the Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively satisfactory from the view of the service provision."
In the Czech Republic without chance, the mobile providers think
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider invents Czechia, this will not be mobileking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very hopeful.
There will be a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region," says a telephone call for mobile.cz Jana Studničková, press speaker of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly appreciative to this thought.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything for not creating a potential competitor.
Their interest in launching a virtual mobile service provider has been showing GTS Novera, who wants to take a further step in order to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-net, but also mobile telecommunication services.
And the earlier, the better.
About this possibility we have repeatedly negotiated with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already been able to achieve negotiation progress," says the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Not official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an inexhaustible wall of silence.
"In this moment, we do not assume that there is a place for a full-value virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specificities compared to other markets.
To date, we have not yet addressed a subject with a complex and serious project in this area," says in his explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Further suppliers also point to the specific Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds rarely to the statement of O2: "We have not yet found a viable and both beneficial project on which you can continue to build."
And she adds: "The network of T-Mobile will not appear a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this moment we should have already had a specific offer to be able to think so short-term."
Vodafone focuses on fulfilling the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open for negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we consider from the view of the customers as the best.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The action of mobile radio providers is easy to understand that another provider called more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thus also to a fall in profits.
So why should such competitors facilitate entry into the market?
The fact that the providers can draw on a strain when it comes to something, is also the long hin and Her about the origin of U:fon.
The strongest pressure towards ČTÚ was at the time when U:fon came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This also provides publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile service provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is evident that a new player on the market itself and above all its services would require high requirements."
However, in view of this approach of mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which is unfortunate in the Czech Republic, unlike the UK and other highly developed countries, has the competence not to intervene in economic competition.
It is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, referred to this whole problem as its very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible after a contract concluded between a mobile service provider and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classical providers," said in his reply to our request Kristián Chalupa from the ÚOHS Department of External Relations.
Such a form would not be surprising by representatives of the providers.
One authority to represent consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one misuses its position on the market is more than vulnerable.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual providers work normally, it is to be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices in mobile phone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a lowering of prices is probably not one of the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking that the almost touching conformity of the three mobile providers, which is due to their reactions.
The question of whether it really is just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same gasoline price in the gas stations is only a coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs in this matter that indicate a action directed against competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his market action.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile market for virtual providers are probably also missing to the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority," Chalupa stated in his statement.
The interpretation of dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the ČTÚ, after telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different viewpoint - for the entry into the market of a virtual provider, it is always necessary to accept the network operator.
And the mobile service provider, of course, has the monopoly for his network.
This means that in a particular segment, it is essential to take a dominant position.
However, even if you do not participate in this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting similarly.
In this context, complaints of a number of stakeholders (including the GTS Novera mentioned) demonstrate that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all suppliers.
The degradation of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a very common trick in the telecommunications services, with which ÚOHS disperses from the whole matter.
This was already observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted Novelle of the Telecommunication Act, it has not succeeded in enhancing the expansion of ČTÚ's competences in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must only know that too well, but they probably have different interests.
It's okay when nobody looks at it.
However, the functioning of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are more than one in the Czech mobile networks.
There are companies who publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partly public.
Usually, it is companies that act in the multilevel marketing sector.
Private mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only come to chosen ones.
The joke of the thing is that the company occurs against the operator as a classic company that orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar geared resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then consider what can lead to the termination of cooperation with the corresponding society," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not talk about those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is against such a procedure.
The activities of these companies do not lead to neglecting profits, while, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický notes possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card does not run on their name in their phone, so they cannot have the full value of such as the normal customers of mobile providers."
But that's the only thing that the ČTÚ should at least be strange.
A further question is open for the ÚOHS.
The mobile operators close their eyes before such a procedure, why are they blocking against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to discover such activities, and if it does not want, it does not have to satisfy the declaration of the providers that they do not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the entry into of virtual providers brought a significant price reduction in the various services.
In doing so, practically in all countries where virtual providers have developed, the classical providers have tried to prevent their origin almost more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a too small, or too much saturated market, problems in quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies, which did not in any way try to preserve the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
If it were by formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator was established, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experiences, we cannot dismiss the impression that clarity in the competences in these cases is more than beneficial.
But we don't throw the flinte into the corn.
If the background information is voted and a virtual provider soon appears, the Czech mobile market may soon be re-established.
If a provider permits the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other stakeholders (discriminating).
And the Czechs will finally not be more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National Hymne Where is my homeland on the day of Czech state in a celebration.
The hymne was newly played by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female sologesang, in chorus and in a instrumental version.
The song was taken by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The processors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech National Song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech broadcaster that he had chosen the solo variants of singers with young, representative voices that are markant and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear dictation with both and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well so that a match can be created," says the conductor.
The Czech national hymn goes on its 175th anniversary next year.
The song KDE domov můj first heard on the stage of the standing theatre in the original Czech piece of Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national hymne after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the Czech Republic.
How sounds the "new" hymns
The Prague transport companies transport for the first time on Wednesday to a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter into the history of Prague's transport operations as a date on which a subway, tram or bus enters the first passengers that bear an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper ticket.
These can now buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day coupon or an annual coupon (if from 1 January 2009) and can simultaneously play it on their chip card in the info centres and branches of transport operations at the subway stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons are also available on the websites of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long snakes for their paper tickets.
They buy the coupon on the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"The travellers also have a switch with trained personnel available in these places, who advises interested person on the internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the map," says Martin Opatrný's spokesperson of the project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-service machines on the Opencard, which are fitted in some subway vestibules.
How do such automations look?
They are red, remember ticket values, the passengers may have already noticed in the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská subway stations.
"Today there are five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it shall be eighty," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls a automation instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays up from yourself.
The electronic coupons apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the area.
So in the suburbal trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mostly the inhabitants of the municipalities of the Central Bohemia region reach the capital.
"In the trains that are integrated into Prague, the train companions have readers with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal from the organisation Ropid. This organisation compiles the schedules for the Prague transport operations.
The suburban buses have card readers on the box at the driver.
When the chip card is entered, the chip card must not only be shown on the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked place on the side of the box.
The driver thus controls the validity of the coupons played.
"If a passenger checks the validity of the coupons played, it is nothing easier than the driver to ask for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive with suburb buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends, can go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the map.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the US
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans asked for the integration of the Böhmerwald to the United States.
This is shown in a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the predominance of the United States of America.
With such a desire, some groups of Sudeten Germans were supposed to have turned to the US Presidents in 1945.
This is part of a letter that has remained in a private archive and is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library today.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the U.S. President that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" which was taken on the basis of Hitler's Munich agreement to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies of German territory, but as a liberator," it says in a letter signed with the words "Men who are at the heart of the fate of the Sudes".
As the connection to Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national character - would expect brutality, insightlessness, inconsent, suppression and slavery, the writer of the letter asks the American presidents to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, without considering the view of a quarter of million inhabitants of this area, you are talking to a foreign state that oppresses and tempts minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allied," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors can't sign is supposedly the fear of revenge desires of the "Shectic oppressors".
If the U.S. President doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or would live under the preservation of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of the postwar history may sound something naive, some of the witnesses believe that it is a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans.
Even though the Bohemian Germans at least had to know that they would be negotiated about their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them had an opportunity to do so at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German at the Navy at the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was brought him into a war prison camp to Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him, he was to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, the Czech would pass them," said Chalupa.
No one of the German war prisoners who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war thought that it would be distributed from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš Decree.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign is directed to drivers
The most expensive action on safety on the streets in the Czech history.
Similarly, the emotionally charged media campaign was characterized, which the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš ůebíček promises to ride drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on flyers.
She's supposed to take the drivers off to faster driving and alcohol at the tax.
And they also remind them that they were attracted before driving.
The campaign wants to speak to young drivers, motorcycle riders, pedestrians and not least professional drivers in their consciences.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "do not think" stand on a sign in uppercase letters.
And in a blood laugh, the word "pay".
This means that you can pay a moment of unattackment with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the viewers by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see normal images with dramatic recordings of accident victims.
It is promised that the number of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech streets fall.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and pits for the drivers
"For the drivers, the motto of sugar bread and pits is applicable.
Sugar bread means they save time, for example, when they drive red.
The plague is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
Even less effective are, according to his opinion, tables that make the drivers aware of a danger.
"When you create a static table that warns against a danger, it will probably soon flow with the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer see them," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The Chairman of the Provisorian Government of Israel Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the return of practically all the areas occupied in 1967, i.e. Jordan, East-Jerusalem and Golan heights, if peace could be concluded with Palestine and Syria in exchange for that.
He stressed this in an interview printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to leave a similar high percentage (Israel territory) to the Palestinians because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would also include East-Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has happened, will have to abandon some of Jerusalem," said Olmert in presentation of two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "Special Solution for the Temple Bears and Holy and Historical Places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty across the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan heights
Olmert spoke of an Israeli deduction from the Golan heights, which, in his view, is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some efforts on the sides of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria alone on the basis of a deduction from the Golan Heights," said Olmert.
"The Syrians only know too well what they have to do to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to abandon their current relationship with Iran; they will have to abandon their relationship with (shiitian) Hezbollah movement; they will have to abandon their constant support to the terrorism of (shiitian) Hamas movement, the terrorist network of Al-Khaida and the Shihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stated.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards illegal in the bus?
The law does not know it, in a remote bus is not allowed to run around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travellers can walk and run on the bus during the journey.
"If we wish to comply with the law strictly and formally, the action of a Steward is contrary to the law on road transport," said the spokesman of the Department of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a two-two-two-year-old Stewardes last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
The young woman was at this moment at all distress next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident at the moment or burn sharply in which Steward produces coffee or newspapers.
One role also plays whether the bus is fitted to the vehicle letter after even standing.
If this is not planned in the bus, the travellers must sit.
The distance buses of the Student Agency have no pitches; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not first agree with the movement of travellers.
Later, we took this back, and we came to a consensus that the travellers may go to the toilet during the ride when they have their seats," he informed his position.
The law does not know Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation which prohibits the transporter to provide services.
The law on road transport knows only the term of vehicle passengers, but its rights and obligations do not define it," the spokesman of the Hanzelka Ministry clearly adds.
On the other hand, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law is subject to this problem.
"It comes to whether the bus in the product permit also has standing places.
That's all," he stresses.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are pitches and the maximum speed is limited, transport buses with pitches and a higher allowed speed and distance bus without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety barriers.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP professional for traffic safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid route, not many dangers threaten, the situation is similar to the service on board a plane.
Even here is not sure when turbulents come, and the stewardess can push his head."
"Boosts a bus sharp, then, of course, the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a roadway.
The safety of Stewards must clarify the transporter by means of internal rules," he says and also says that this problem is not completely resolved from the perspective of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company that offers Stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider its profession as risky even after the accident.
"But if I get the impression that Steward's profession is risky, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive travelers when they arrive.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of Stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have a steward eating, but we've already begun from the beginning.
Earlier or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he had not said a whole year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy
In the event of an accident of a line bus to Naples, a young Stewardess from the Pilsen region was disturbed, which had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably without blinking off the stairs and had locked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to evade through a sharp manoeuvre, however, collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura argues that the two places were sold for the Stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to complain truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but a financial compensation will also be expected from the debtor's side.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more detailed control of Steward's movement on board a bus could bring a legal regulation on which a thirty-country expert team of the Ministry of Transport has already worked for over a year.
"But this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the score system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones on the ride," said Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of Stewards as something that could significantly threaten the safety of travellers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of police and labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorf's hopes rest at Frankfurt
In large words, the letter of the WestLB board does not lack to the staff of the house.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf Money Institute with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen Financial Group" could arise, the letter announced on Monday.
The WestLB invades a "competency block" with sustainable yield power into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive trigger of further bonds in the national banking sector.
Thus it is read when a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
Because the hit WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services, which recently clarified the North Rhine-Westphalian State Government, the time to find a future solution.
However, the WestLB has been speaking for some time - also on Frankfurter Seite - of a connection between the Deka Bank, which is known for its investment funds.
Although Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas informed in the presentation of half-year numbers at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a national bank, such as Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Deka Administrative Board, which is carried out half by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassen Associations, has commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be about the capital market or parts of it.
The conversations have just begun, as it says, at the financial place.
The Deka Bank, which is one of the more important employers at the Frankfurt Finance Square, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen sector.
In 2003 it looked like the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
However, there was nothing from this Trinity League.
At least the plans had become public, the Hessian state government objected to Helaba’s participation.
The two other houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have been always thought games about a connection of the Deka Bank with Landesbanken.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Helaba, had spoken against plan games about intercourse with his house.
However, the knowledge seems to mature that a collapse of the different houses of the public-law sector is in need.
After the country-day election is over in Bavaria, the BayernLB could first get closer to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily a good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure rises to further mergers, she continues to go out to the partners for that.
In the south, it would be only Junior Partners, although it has been far better through the financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is part of the Helaba with 85 percent, has, at the beginning of the year, launched a coupling with the West LB.
In any case, the North LB remained.
However, such geostrategic thoughts are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June Merl, the crucial question of the business model to ensure the future capabilities of the Landesbanks, was not answered by the German Sparkassen and Giro Association.
At the end, there could also be a destruction of the West LB, which, however, is not desired there.
Thus, in the letter of the board there, it is also spoken of that it is in any case intended to be a "total solution" for the house.
As this can be brought under a hat with the interaction of individual units with the Deka bank, it will still be shown.
The second weekend is known as the "Italy Weekend"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena is with his girlfriend, and so is everything different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter bier barrel of the Emperor brand, stands a massively built beardiger and proves to the about 200 October festival, which deep sounds can produce its throat.
Elena gives Luca a clap, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses start this evening at 23.45 o'clock, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected to arrive at 6.30 o'clock.
Three buses are mainly reserved to Italians, in a bus only traveling Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing alongside their flag, they have already celebrated in the night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelcimitate food and a glass of broad silver irons, includes the buses.
For five years they have been driving to the October festival, three tours alone this year.
Go to the night, on the meadows, back at 22.30 a.m.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary speses, says Marco.
75 Euros cost the journey, the welcome trip with Emperor-Bier, browned faithful to the Bavarian cleanliness, health insurance and German-language guide - Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet in the bus, the travellers will sleep.
Well, they will still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where some other buses with Italian marks on the motorway 8 will take a break shortly before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at half seven o’clock in the early morning on the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already the 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First, put up the yellow chicken.
On it is left "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors go up to the beerzelt, it says run!", Marco calls in the morning.
Run!" Run and place in the rear part of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow coats on the same benches, distribute in the room."
The measure, bursts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget drinking.
"The securitymen show that we are doing well!
Once you leave the places, they're gone!"
Thirdly, "Today evening, find point half eleven again here!" Understand?
And it's going to mess.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as roadmarks to the trees, to signs and even to the electoral place of a large Bavarian folk party.
You want to be weaped for the retreat.
It is the second weekend known as the "Italy Weekend".
There are no exact figures; the speech is of 50 000 who are going through the Alps and enter the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich Police is strengthened by seven police from South Tyrol, Italian voluntary helpers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistics in which the Italians (about 60 inputs) and Austrians (about 80) have the first place with about 200 medical supplies.
It is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also confesses that the German banking sector is not spared from the critical developments.
For it has now happened on the weekend.
The Munich Real Estate Financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) noted in the Dax receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from the turbulences on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that credit assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate must only retire the part which it also takes.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background are losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he has granted money, the State financer had refinanced itself extremely short-term - which is now no longer possible because of lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve was reduced by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity rate was slightly lower from 1.6% to 1.45%.
The current revenues and net revenues from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year, the revenue from tenders to claims and certain securities and the dissolution of credit transactions by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only due to higher revenues from reimbursement of deposited accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest in accordance with the order of taxation and from the business care for business companies, the revenue minus had still been moderated by around 16 percent.
The former state financer had first been speculated with commercial real estate loans after his privatisation in 1990, which had then been divided into the Aareal Bank.
Because the classical state financing was too deserved, the Depfa had then increased its commitment to infrastructure projects and to the financing of Community private investors and the state (PPP private public partnership) and international diversification.
To the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "real material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend was deleted.
She was cut by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been an important state and infrastructure financer since the Depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market as it does not have any customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, credit grants among the banks are reversed largely, as banks are observing their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs for a part - around EUR 50 billion - of the Depfa credit portfolio for short-term refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate communication, the financing needs of the Group are covered with the loan for an indefinite period and the company is protected from "the influence of the currently largely incapable international money markets".
From other sources, it is heard that, thanks to the funds, refinancing was guaranteed by the end of 2009.
The HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets at an abstinent time.
Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
This is for shareholders and creditors of the Bank to hope.
But in view of the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unreasonable that the financing does not have to be fully used.
But also the opposite is not to be cut out.
After the hearing after the bank was still before the insolvency on the late Sunday evening, the at least provisional rescue could not calm the minds.
The share rate breaks by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the borrowing courses are quite good.
When priority debts are barely moved, the courses of post-rang bonds are more clearly reflected.
In particular, the borrowings of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are concerned, and understandably the run-ups beyond 2009.
The fact that Hypo-Real-Estate bonds have previously been a speculative investment alternative, its valueability must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, according to the significant intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had taken over the Depfa crisis.
As long as notes banks, governments and less-committed business banks are still ready to support the system, a periodic reduction of pensions can be assumed.
Or, however, it happens what hardly anyone can hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overwhelmed in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reporting that is covered by the sub-statement, the probability of security has currently become just a legitimate hope.
This is most likely to be a few sleepless nights for long-term believers to decide whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors may, in any event, use a final item to make a loss contribution for future tax payments on price gains in the past years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce himself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to chew: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before schooling.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, for luck I didn't walk.
The beginning of the school at Tachibana does not seem as strictly defined as at home in Lower Saxony.
The pupils drove in from eight o'clock, until nine o'clock ago a short round of meetings begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the school began, I was on the line to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to speak to people, even before a class of 40 students.
Because I hadn't had a school uniform yet, I dressed an old skirt of my nurses, blue knees, and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator, I put myself in front of the pult and tried to speak things correctly: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, come from Germany and have birthday in one week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had started learning the language well two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all shaken, boiled and wounded and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'lovely, sweet'.
Then I was quick to go to my place.
The girl beside me was pretty broad, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the  Gong sounded, I was really stumbled.
All talked and kicked and asked me holes in the abdomen - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then during the break, all their bentos packed out.
My guest mother had also made me a lunch box - that's something different from the oath of German breakbread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruits and a kind of meat in the tofuman.
Mostly I don't have a bleaching shimmer, what I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely novel.
I'm sure everything's really delicious.
Well, maybe up to the salty plants, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which she then produces especially artificially - in the hope of getting to know the boy in the breaksnack.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I'm just excited if I can see this.
'Why, Japan?', my girlfriends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said:
"Because it's fascinating me."
Finally, I have been reading the most popular mangas for years.
And so that I better understand the comics and culture in it, I also started to learn a little Japanese sometime.
So for me it was quite clear that I had to travel here some time.
Because I also have a feasibility for tradition, morals and customs.
And this is a great deal of value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a shame fleeing at risk means that she also feels fear?
Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Just how can you check if they feel the same if they are acting like us?
The Internet magazine " Edge" has published articles of famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other conditions of consciousness, without I or anyone else to prove this where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and collapse questions of feeling or general consciousness, we enter irrelevant territories because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it is dead, escaped, or attacked.
People are similar, some scientists have a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
Firstly, the almost always associated circuits with human consciousness include the sidely prefrontal Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term and in the execution/control functions).
This wide region is much higher developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic way of owning is likely to be in the linguistic nature of man: Since a large part of his experience is linked to language, it often says that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, you could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, this would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, probably differed very much from most of our consciousness conditions.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may appear in other animals.
If it can be analyzed as something internal and subjective, neither measured nor, because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, his research poses great problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more accessible scientifically.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term impairment of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, it is more likely to refer to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal Cortex for the condition of visualization.
What is the result of the feelings?
I reiterate them that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in one of his own activity conscious brains.
So what we call "furcht" is the mental state in which we are in when the activity of the defensive system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) demonstrates memory.
As a result, feelings are closely linked to the Cortex regions, which characterize primates and in particular humans.
Associated with linguistic nature, fine sensitivity results because with the help of the words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorize conditions in order to attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio thinks that feelings from primitive activities in the body regions of Cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, but more concentrated on the brain strain.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it could have been involved in gatting-wide sensations.
I can't contradict this purely theoretically, but I think it's unreasonable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and people, is likely to feel like this in both cases, but how can one check whether rats and people feel the same if they act similarly?
A shame flies at risk whether she also feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity cannot prove equality of experience yet.
However, the neural comparison continues: rats and people have similar brain strains, but not even a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if this could be proved to humans, how would it be shown in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even shame (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress is rising at the neural level, if the same is measured in rats and people.
How I don't explore language and consciousness at rats, even if I don't feel, I don't know if they exist.
You may think that's short-sighted, but I'd rather get ahead than keep running against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionist.
Uefa President Platini: Term of Grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as a trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise EM with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of the stages, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts turn back.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work with maximum speed now," said the Ukrainian Association President Grigoriry Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep us constantly in the eye."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had come together at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"The serious danger is that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish News Agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several first-liters had been condemned for manipulation in the past season alone, and finally even the launch of the league had to be postponed in the short term.
Empöred Dennis Quaid hits back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about Privates - and now has anger with the ex: Hollywood Star Meg Ryan outlet her flooded Dennis Quaid as a adult.
He's shaken and slept back.
Late Rosen War with Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after her divorce, the two Hollywood shoe players now have an incredible dispute - in all public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan said for the first time for the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The degree of fraud did not experience them after divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - told the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Is it immense," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News", that "Meg repeatedly recoups and reverses the history of our relationship".
It is also "being regrettable" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is "reminiscent of the pain and the revolts that mean divorce for each child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is again married and has recently become father of Zwillingen.
And so his deposits conclude with the sidehib: "My life continues anyway.
I appreciate that I have a wonderful family that is best going on."
Reduce prices for flights and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper than 50 percent, according to a current study.
Flights and nights in hotels have again become cheaper - this is the result of a study of American Express's travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant breakdown in the second quarter after a price increase in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the nights of many places have already been approved.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities studied still increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, the prices were already by 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most clearly in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year earlier.
As a result of this, American Express sees the weak dollar course that led to a "decreasing sport of American tourists".
Also, financial places such as Frankfurt or London are more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend in the first quarter also showed upwards at the flight prices:
Due to kerosin defense, travellers in the economy class had to pay 7.1 percent more than 2007, fuel intense long-distance flights were even more expensive than 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the economic class prices decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, the price changes were much lower.
In Germany prices increased even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
In German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even halfed.
On the one hand, the company explains that price breakdown is the decline in economic growth.
The demand in many segments of the flight market breaks.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, increases competition pressure.
Signs of the tense situation are the removal of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had notified bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - alone in Europe, these were 24 airlines.
HSV slept Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes table leader.
With the Borussia Luhukay continues to find a functioning elephant.
Zoom from Kristoffer Klein Breaklandung for National Player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game lately and failed with a Heber to the late.
His message was precisely formulated, she went convincingly to him about the lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin entrance of the Hamburg Arena.
Many weren't going into the catacombs, the mid-term break was finished and most were sitting back on their seats.
Rieger was almost three decades Physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a higher prestige than some flooded actor.
And so his request also found hearing in a responsible place.
Assistance trainer Cornelius Jol nicked and lifted the thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief trainer Martin Jol.
That command will have been similar: here with gate two!
The implementation continued.
"There wasn't everything to see today," admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt would've wanted it "relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) are due to Mladen Petric's headball hit (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summoned.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky over the Arena and the flash table on the video wall, which proved their club as a class prime.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know this to be arranged," said Marcell Jansen.
He realizes that the tablelaric intermediate product is more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its lately committed accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Torschütz Petric and the Jansen, who are devoted to the FC Bayern - is slow to shine yet.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol asked.
After the voting defeat
There's anxiety at Wall Street.
First news from the failure of the rescue package allowed the Dow Jones to break by 700 points.

The shares of the Bank Goldman Sachs yielded by almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, Great investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
In the context of the rescue plan, the funds for purchasing so-called fabulous mortgage documents are to be provided.
However, the sum is to be paid, not at one stroke, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive share option certificates of financial companies which could be triggered in the event of corresponding course developments in order to reduce the burden on the State cash.
Aktienkurse in Europe and USA in downwards

Dark matter influences flight of space consignments
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been providing advice in research: Dark matter influences the speed of spaces during so-called Swing-by-manoeuvre.
Experts fear that the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein could not be quite correct.
Nearly 18 years, the spaceline "Ulysses" fled through the space.
Because of frozen fuel pipes soon, you are threatening the cold death.
Under scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been creating confusion for years - the Swing-by-Anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of spacelines, where they receive additional vibration in the gravitation field of a sky body, such as the earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The Cassini-Huygens research station in Europe used this physical trick as well as the sunshine of Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been surprised for years: the airlines do not behave 100 percent as expected by the old-faith gravitation law.
Rather, there is irregularities in speed.
The sins are unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by curbing the room, could not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein did not mislead, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter that astronomers made up in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space researchers have only been aware of the existence of the dark matter for about ten years.
Obviously, it is a attraction force whose effect can be observed on other heavenly bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, the dark matter is still well a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists dragged into Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransoms.
In a shooting before the release, six hostage workers should have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Solutions negotiations are already supposed to run.
Germans are repeatedly in the visor of kidnapps.
WELT ONLINE paints the most important cases.
The European tourists dragged into the Sahara are apparently free.
This reported the Egyptian national television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabia and Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're just checking her health condition," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were well-being and in safety, reported Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition should already be on the way to Cairo.
Unclear remains the backgrounds of a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were therefore ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the official.
"Only it was going to receive the hostages," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers in the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported on a German intermediary, the release of hostages delayed because the kidnappers feared their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the solvent.
The men should be held until the kidnappers would have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Misuse of the stepfather " led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stieffather led a woman to kill himself, a court was reported.
Michael Trerisi, 57, from Stitians, Cornwall, received a six - year prison penalty after he had suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Tribunal in Truro learned that he was regularly celebrating his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle died in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her and connected her eyes before he carried out sexual acts while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Trerisi and his wife were divorced in the 1980s, and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked a large part of her time honorably for the National Trust, was persecuted by abuse, which had been added to her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "paid her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she was killed by choking himself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the stepfather of his daughter who wrote a letter of consent that ended: "I used to boil her and to connect her eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been fearful, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would be ending before court if she had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanies' father and mother, her deed over the years on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would have been clearly a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for the loss of data shall be accused of
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be accused of the "Public Security Act".
The man was decreed from the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed out to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no reference to criminal intention.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be intervening internally with the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
The person whose name cannot be mentioned shall be accused of, in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause covering the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor recommended that the official be accused by the Metropolitan Police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he published contained classified reviews on Al-Quaida and the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
After the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could spend more than 80 million pounds in the house.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
The interest rate for this loan is paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Apartment Building Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "inaccessible" that the societies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repayed when Bradford & Bingley's loans have been repaid.
However, the interest charged in the meantime will be charged each year to 700 financial undertakings that accept deposits.
The Compensation Programme of Financial Services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions who have acted carefully ... are now called to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest rate for credit will be 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies must obtain 81 million pounds for the interest rates of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Apartments, informed the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions who have acted carefully during the real estate upturn are now called to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
Interests falling in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be paid for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since building companies are both sides of society, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or by lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre expensive
People in Jersey are confronted with paying more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the big market price of its milk by five more pences per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of an advisory company have been carried out.
The retailers should decide whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the Grand Market Price of Jersey Milch last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a guilt request from the former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that it could be arrested when it returns to the country.
Her defenders said that the court refused bail in respect of the charge 50 million Taka ($729.700) to have crushed by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating charges for corruption against them.
Shich Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released against bail at the beginning of this month.
Shich Hasina is supposed to return to Bangladesh in the next weeks, but her party, the Awami Bündnis, demanded that the military-supported transitional government should first give her full freedom.
The correspondents say that even though their liability was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of their release whether it will be able to continue on a free foot when it returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers indicate that it will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Shech Hasina's guilt, because it says she has not to be granted a deposit, since she is already on detention posted abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will register a complaint against the upper court."
Her lawyers agree that they need bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the elections in December.
It is expected that Shech Hasina will return home after 17 October, said an Awami Association Party Chairman on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over, but in June she had been released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Shech Hasina, as well as Khaleda Zia, deny all the accusations against themselves.
Anxieties for the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, says the United Nations.
The United Nations last week carried out an vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the promise of the Taliban that the thousands of vaccination workers should not attack or disrupt.
BskyB loses action in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost his complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing sender ITV.
The Court of Competition ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted competition and made it an unfair influence on the ITV broadcaster.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed to Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB made doubts about the independence of the ITV, which has moved the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Office of Communications of Ofcom have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share in ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, in particular because BskyB had announced to give up his voting rights.
New U.S. State Prosecutor Investigation
The U.S. General Prosecutor has commissioned a special intermediary to address the cancellation of the nine prosecutors in the US in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the Administrative Workers were criticized.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, legislators and the former general attorney Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The specialist nora Dannehy should now clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the intermitters in order to hinder justice.
In addition, serious accusations of criminal action have not been fully examined or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The calling of a special intermediary with the power to force the witnesses to say was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began as the Ministry of Justice in December 2006, and nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be released due to weak work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the cancellations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-ranking Republican congress members, while others refused to examine the accusations of democracy.
U.S. prosecutors are responsible for examining and persecuting judicial cases for the government.
They can be released at any time but must not be disposed of for political reasons.
The former director of the General Prosecutor of Justice Alberto Gonzales has been dismissed as a result of the releases and has set up his office in the final effect.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also ceased.
In particular, the report of the General Inspector addressed the role of Gonzales critically by carrying out the "main responsibility" for the releases, "returned" his leadership role and "extremely disinterested" in the process
Other officials, including the former chief consultant of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the intermediaries.
Meat Loaf's epic song should be honored
Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored for his epic hymne "Bat Out Of Hell" during the music prize award.
The singer, the next week in London will accept its special golden price during the grant, said that he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loafs Hitalbum from 1977.
"Coldplay" leads to the nominations for the granting of this year after it has come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there were some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" are certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was sold in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979 and has reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 because of irregular heartbeat after he was collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute boilhead inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his voice band.
Obscure street in town, often forgot to sell and perhaps soon
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, sideways and other roads, some of which are famous and others are just comfortable.
Nevertheless, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, it is difficult to say where extra place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This small road is located in the East Village and runs north from the First Street direction between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty hole than after an active route.
There are no street signs either.
It is practically impossible to find it on a standard street plan.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious building on First Street.
It wants to new extra place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other worshipers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says that she is fascinated by the short street, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
But the City Administration Department, which is responsible for the protection and establishment of the residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan to be presented in the next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the municipal council 3.
"Since very little space has remained in possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small road was rebuilt and seats, among other things, designed for a café to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the road, it didn't mean to have them.
"The main concerns of Avalon Bay are to renovate and make it a public meeting point," she said and added that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Department of Building Protection, said that it was actually the desire of the city to sell the road and stressed that the department's task was to develop the real estate rather than to manage.
Compared with its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained something of his historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802 when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was split between his numerous children and no one claimed a narrow striped country.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk dry memorial, which was closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is probably most known as the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the blogger who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling extra place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (including "The Book of Appeals: A bitter nostalgic view of the extinction city"), published a part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place, published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow sackgasse that remains dark even during the day and is marked by roasted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and rainins flying week-old newspapers."
With a few exceptions, the road looked just as recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back part of the street, not far from the door that led earlier to the CBGB, where there is a more expensive clothing business today.
Graffiti was on the walls and an empty beer bottle was not far away from a fresh bundle of arranged newspapers.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished something.
Fields, added that, in his opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, humid and ugly.
Debate on two-speaking training: Education in English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for two-lingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific staff in California studies and leading director in the field of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a choice".
To address hispanese electors is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of afro-American and hispanese students is successful to complete the school, lower than in white students" - what is true.
In order to close this performance level, Obama's educational plan specifically recommends a two-speaking transitional phase in training for those who learn English first.
The question of Obama is, however, whether his use for the two-speaking training, which focuses on teaching in other languages than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance in school services.
Let's take the example of "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are hispanic and come from families with low income.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of the fourth class students were at a good level in mathematics.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year were considered well in the English examination.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street school focuses on verification and exercise, on steady control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach to which the training runs in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point Obama should observe, according to the school director Linda Mikels.
This approach values the almost exclusive use of the English language in the course of a specialised lesson.
Ms. Mikels, who refused the idea of two-speaking training, said to me that the school would have been a remarkable success with a pupil who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, you could enter the classroom and no longer recognize it.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students?
The benefits of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the education positions within its own party (the national image ignorants have long supported the idea of two-speaking training) and its own consistent support for two-speaking training make predictions about Obama's answer unambiguously.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop making anxiety about the "only English" targeting legislation.
Instead, he said, "They should make sure that your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance level, he should take care of educational models that work instead of despising and trivializing them.
The oil price decreases as a result of new concerns about the economy
The oil price is on Monday due to the fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be sufficient to revive the economy.
In the morning session, raw oil dates on the New York commercial stock exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulences at Wall Street and by strong wire towers in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, to then rise again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have already been concerned, even though congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan that should be the largest in history.
This message was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis was not yet completed.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, the Citigroup is to buy up the banking businesses of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
After analysts at Barclay's Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place during the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems not possible to experience the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to fall.
Analysts of the Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"With the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
Analysts of the Bank have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the next year and reduced their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after he spent the last eight and a half years more than anyone else in the Jets Tricot.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets transformed a resultless game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
After a slippery game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback board Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect appearance to a afternoon on which their developing cooperation made a great step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one once as a foreign defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the mid-term.
"I haven't been very hard," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played fishing, the defense Quarterback Kurt Warner took apart.
Outside defender Darrelle Revis caught a degraded worp and transformed it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and started him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets conquered the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 tour.
These were most points that the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter to reach without one, Mangini said: "Give me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Extended burstassie hits his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some hold him for the best longitudinal runner of all times, after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and being the first person who has reached the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his versatile career, where he has reached at least a world championship title or a world record on every route from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month Gebrselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, out of fear, which afterwards might have been exaggerated that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he registered for the contest in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - brusselassie won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train runners such as Brselassie and Paul Tergat have changed long distances from Kenya, the record time for Marathon has fallen for more than 2 minutes over the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had two weeks ago in his wade and therefore could not train a week.
Obviously, he's refreshed after a break and didn't come back.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All walked perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but at the end, everything great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Rivals from East Africa - that he was exaggerated by his race runs, many world best marathon stars generally avoided, too much relying on the racing leaders as if this would be a rail race, and world records about the competition.
However, this criticism scarcely damages the size of bursts as a longitudinal runner.
Following four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai, and Charles Kamathi continued to call out burstassie after the pacemakers left.
Some more than three miles before the finish, Brselassie made his last arrival to separate himself from Kwambai, which arrived as the second in 2:05:36 and thus improved its best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all times with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliffe from the UK.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She has sent her course by letting a quartet out of Ethiopian and Kianian runners out only after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as a third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the strawls in the lives of the black population, in a city of very special kind
Hidden between the excitements of the recreational parks in the district of Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic rifles, there is a quiet city in which pride and complications of the Afro-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the countryside and the home town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three crockery places, 300 brown houses, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that she describes is and remains – and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida guide, which was produced at the time of depression by the Federal writer project – in many ways a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is so independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who knows "as little about us that he doesn't know what is going on him."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many are still sorry to be observed by foreigners.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and municipality member of the oldest church of the city.
It must vote."
Eatonville was defined for a long time as a paradox of triumph and fight.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a municipality of almost 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
On the one hand, it is a high-bourg of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents are both proud and alert here.
And as right, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as all the Hurston here calls.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Frech as Oskar, both in real life and literature, led Hurston readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Beside the road to the left," she wrote, "the brown - wise modern school is located, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that always care about Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn sells "drinks of any kind and always fits to hour rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This certainly wasn't a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls evacuated the Hurston by quoting the men, the songs about which their beauty sang, which were full of sexual plays.
She added, "Many people didn't like this."
It still remembers Hurtson as a lively excentric who regularly returned after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
August Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston was brewered into the city, she usually did this without warning, in a noiseing chevrolet, smoking, and clothing with trousers, in a city that itself imagines something of her honorable style of clothing today.
According to Mr Franklin, most people were fascinated, while many despised them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he slipped in his chair, on a rear terrace that looks at the Lake Sabelia, in which Hurston was all likely to be baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books broke.
Together with the vast part of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary man Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was put in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no big memorial celebration, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-spure motorway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-spure main road of the municipality.
Orlandos suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among others, had ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"In this time often a bunch of white boys came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting off," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a water melons out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston, in a letter to Orlando Sentinel, asked the Supreme Court to force integration by designating its decision against the School Council as "politely rather than respecting my race" in the case of Brown.
Inhabitants say today that although the abolition of racial separation in some respects was positive, they weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his young people.
"Black children were used to get embarrassed - I remember - to embrace his teacher in the morning and to embrace his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and business director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be preserved so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural gap," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who overlooked prejudices, just as she did, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made himself on the way to Hurston's unnamed grave and began to fight for the revival of her glory.
Five years later, a much praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the book shelves and made it part of the American literature canon again.
The main road project came exactly at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public light.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a deliverer.
The municipality started planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its street plans.
"The plans of a five-spure highway inhabited the city, accelerated the whole with peak speed, awakened genuine citizen pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd expressed it a bit easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more trainees, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has gone to the church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was recorded in 1998 in the national historical register.
A new one-story library (naturally named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly planted and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from the Orlandos city centre can sometimes feel like a backway in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(They're 90% black today.)
Outstandings looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white one and represents black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her abandoned community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time when the Hurston festival grew bigger, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Above all young people tend to see Eatonville as seen by Hurston their entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither bad nor better, and as proud, creative and diligent, aloud and interfering as any other race and peoples group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to the college to Eatonville to work in the city administration or in the police that, according to him, could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who pass through here will think: "Ach, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alon Kenon on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here we are in New York, we're talking flowing financial latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens at Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they are in the middle of a blanket.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe box-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedgefond managers, who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst horror work day every day since the stock exchange of 1929.
The suppliers are still pushing the metallic tea waves along the Citizen Steige and transporting tablets loaded with Muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latinos still sleeps between apartments, like human packings loaded with around 50 arched T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod on their shoulders.
Office staff are still waiting for food stands on their breakfast basin on their citizens and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekly day between 16 and 19 a.m.
It didn't feel like a crisis until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all of the world's undergoing talks.
Although I decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal familial, about 20 people already stood snake.
Not to the money switches to pick up or pay money, but to the customer service slot where tribal customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to Macy's store and where new customers open accounts.
Most before me, I later learned from Starr, my "personal banking employee with license," standed for the same reason as I snake.
In contrast to me, however, they had already withdrawn from smaller banks, in places from where they pendured, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had abolished money from so-called Thrifts (a little of a building parkasse similar), co-operative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks have gone quietly and quietly.
During the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with installations of $327 billion, went home in bank management and as a last Friday New Yorker went over weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns savings as a value of $440 billion, was looking for a rescuing buyer.
In the fear of another inturn, the office and shopworkers brought them before me to their bares to a bank considered safe port, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases at Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have been fitting in the last few weeks running financial latin.
A woman who was calling in my Chinese tribal supermarket referred to Lehman Brothers with so much confidentiality, the Pleite went bank and their dismaying board chairman Dick Fuld, as if she was torn over a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my living block, has come from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going into a risko anymore."
Muslemic graves damaged during legal rush in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a Left-Director of the Austrian Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right Pertei Vlaam's interest, participates in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 in order to represent the organization "Städte gegen Islamisierung".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is pictured, stretched through a red line.
The police accuse legal extremists of grave damage at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, at the same weekend at the extreme right parties significant gains in the parliamentary election of the country.
In the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in an action organized, according to the police.
The offenders sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials believe that this is an attempt to hide the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said they were "intimidated" about the message of the grave shame that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan tends to end.
At the same time, in Austria, a round of conscience research is being carried out after the country slipped right in the previous parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the future of Austria, the two far-right-oriented parties who received almost 30% of the votes, committed themselves in their election for a strict anti-immigration law and some of their claims were criticized by opposers as opposed to foreign.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, set up for a ban of head towels and Burkas, even proclaiming his disagreement against foods that are commonly linked to Islam.
At his last announcement in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent Islam's growth.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarettes with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election and claiming that the extreme rights of the most politically strong block in the country are pointed out that this new development is based on young electors who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel bar for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star, who was sentenced to sexual abuse of children, was sentenced to travel to France and Spain.
Judges set up a six-month block after informing the authorities in charge of traveling to Spain via France.
The police in Kent were granted last Thursday to hang a foreign travel block after she presented the judges proof of Glitter's precautions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Office in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning.
EIn spokesperson of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, September 25th, the police Kent asked the Office of Ashford to prevent the permission to travel abroad from Mr Paul Glad to France and Spain until March 25th.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
According to the register for sexual criminals, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police seven days before his planned departure.
The absence of notification from the authorities could lead to a 5-year prison penalty.
The police in Kent said she would not discuss individual cases or glitters of possible residence in the country.
A spokesman of Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in that country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is the highest concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kents and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse to 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter fled to Bangkok, where he was supposed to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him go by passing control and he flew to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also refused him to enter, and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials were to return to the UK.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's Uxbridge office in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for approval, to demand that he register as a sexual criminal.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for 4 months before in 1999 because of the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the Minister of Interior Jacqui Smith was calm and satisfied that Glitter was held to travel to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no rhythms, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the large flame cottons that abandon the concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artist
On the other hand, personality
I look in private life, in these moments that are strange to the audience, I know when to find typical gestures for the personality, the depth of a stolen view or expression of the hands that are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', German photographer Günter Bauer represents alternating theatricals of some stages with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this site he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco display at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the Month of Photography of Flamenco, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which becomes increasing from day to day, against ', explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' can be any human, but if you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
All normal people in the portraits are artists who are capable of passion, sadness, joy and thus moving the audience.
To hold the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on the stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What I was interested in creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the largest flamenco championship with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, pictures created that remember classic photography.
The application of different stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea, as the Bauer Flamenco understands: `Music with traditional roots that change and surprise every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental game itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that is visible in the form of hearing, of being, and was the fixed goal of this work, presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the next time.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take this idea two years ago and realized it as 'portraits of the veterans of sport' ('SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me a great pleasure to photograph people, to know them and to put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genus.
You're up to people, personalities that you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realise my ideas.'
The collection of the flamenco portraits of today with the title `Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of the El Fotómata, located in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa recognizes that the Roma that he just writes is a greatness.
He still does not know where the novel's action takes place and what it's about, but Mario Vargas Llosa continues to try to advance the project in which he works just, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred nobel prize winner admitted that the project that he was engaged in is a greatness and `alls indicates that he would not have to write the novel'.
`If I had been consent, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel sometime', so he closed his participation at the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists, and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival's Premium and gave the most present their voice, is compared with the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and is seen in the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had a audience before himself, which noticed that the Peruan who has a wonderful memory and great humor feeling was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature was created, which was made of `extraordinary adventure pleasure', from 'Freude at reading' and from 'more experience than before'; how he writes and `Disziplin stands', in order to complement `the lack of inspiration', his intense work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; like Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas his vocation influenced and which 'Gednis' are the basis for his stories.
The hispano-American novel writer admitted that there is no way in which one can measure and wherever one knows whether books change life, but I refuse to believe that the literature is pure entertainment, a volatile experience', Vargas Llosa emphasized, who claims that it produces 'effects' and 'the people brings even more apart', so I asked the writers not to leave ease' and 'the responsibility' for his vocation'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bulleries fell partly.
After the announced bull fighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bull fight with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be completed was placed yesterday morning.
The organizer, with consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to move the bull fight.
Thus the festival of inconsistent weather was exposed, so two of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, for what reason the second planned bull fight could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días, and Juan Bautista, who continued to enter the bulleries.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who triumphed three ears after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same night, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which was more successful by galopping than by his bull-fighting art.
And even worse was El July, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After so badly fought, a large part of the audience responded in his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of Haschish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police forces called on the drivers of the car to stop, and then they took the escape.
It looked like they would not have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of Haschish.
The police persecuted her and took one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as it told the Interior Ministry of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the Álava Transport Police of the region had already completed the N-1 traffic control and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police began the persecution until the car stayed after a few kilometres on the border trip. At the moment the drivers rose out of the car to flee over a road to a forest area.
The police of Ertzaintza took one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of Haschish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with haschish bundles, which were later directed to the precise laboratory analysis and to the weighing of the bundle to other police stations.
In addition, officials noted that the mark was 'doublet', so that it did not agree with the mark specified in the car papers, and therefore a arrest was also made for the failure of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned above, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the drug in possession.
The 28-year-old A. A. J., was taken to a police service. He will be presented to the prisoner in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The actress Heather Locklear, known by the role of Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
A Witness has observed how she tried to get out of her park gap in Montecito in a rather strange way, so spokesperson of the California Transport Police reported to the magazine `People'.
The Witness told in detail that Locklear ` pushed Gaspedal after 16:30 and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forth from the park's hole, and when she reared, she faded her sunbrille several times.'
Something later, the Witness, who at first the actress probably did not know that Locklear held on a nearby road and went out of the car.
The Witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had lived `Anxiety about Locklears'.
When the police tread came, they found the actress sitting in their car, standing across the street and blocking traffic.
`They seemed to be unoriented', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress showed cooperative, excessive alcoholic genus was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of officials resulted in, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medicine', says the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an undefined substance which could not be determined and brought to a local investigation at nine o’clock.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona Hospital after treatment, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares relies on the fact that the Andalusian Association of the United Left becomes responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the Chief Coordinator of the United Left and United Left, has now assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the City Hall in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had withdrawn last week after he was accused of making business with family members.
`In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out what approach the party must have to do to the party who is still sitting as a council in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the Chairman of the VL defended the need for 'transparence' in the possible investigations of the rule infringements that Silva might have started: 'The VL was always aware of the maximum transparency of such cases'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public authorities.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero Book of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spanish against the French. This is a marvelous film in filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for the filmworks.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to present a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he has always admired in the works of the famous novel writer, today, Carci explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in cinema and later shown on Telemadrid as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, the great fan of the literature of Galdós, assured that thanks to this film, he was in fulfillment of his 'childness space'. This is due to Esperanza Aguirre, which three years ago commissioned him from the autonomous community of Madrid to turn a commemoration film to the second century celebration in Madrid on November 2nd. Especially because the story was based on `Episodi's Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was presented by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for spinning, provides Garci, as he added, the 'one-time possibility' with the help of decorations and similar clothing, the picture of the 'confusioned Spain, which sought the false leader for the fight, because the people had been reversed by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII.'.
However, the Cineast regrets that you couldn't expect the financing of `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as with `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', was involved by his ordinary operation: he was on the stage to the actors with whom one must first try before you start turning and for those who did not casting appearing humiliating and respecting, `a part of the career of the film director is to provide help in the theatre and the cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many performers, on which he stuck in `Sangre de mayo', have to repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), believes and assured that no one of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither 'Sangre de mayo' nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' nor finally the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci expects no awards for this movie.
`In the beginning, you think you're working for the offspring, later you notice that it's only for good, and now you're satisfied if you've produced another film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tortola Valencia
A flame cotton from Seville adorns a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: Her father was Catalane (Florenç Nathanola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusier (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), who was born in the triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhistin, vegetarian and set herself for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
`We don't try to tell about her life without keeping her esprit,' said the flame cotanist.
Your dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco.
`The dance of the butterfly' appeared to me, for example, like Guajira, or `the dance of the serpent' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensible and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area,” she claims.
The stage expects two extraordinary cooperations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel in one of her ideas, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who would work exclusively with one of her ex-school women.
`Matilde plays Churtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The stage also counts with musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas in whom he is always in love."
This work also tells us in a certain way about the life of this woman, which was known in as far places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
`I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a particular epoch and their works no longer today and for this reason she is even less aware of it', says Bayón.
The presentation will take place today at 20:30 in the Theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to remember the fifty anniversary of the awarding of the Literature Nobel Prize and the death day of the two.
`The Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international convention that takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and presented during the international convention.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The USA can imagine badly without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in `Sensation Reporter', and from the then reigning idea of the American cinema, which was imprisoned, came from all of America to Newman with his enthusiasm and followed her.
Now see what it cost to give him the Oscar.
And when he returned in 2007.
And he knew he was very ill.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
"What sometimes feels is much more than a expression, and now I have lost a big friend," said Robert Redford crying, "my life and my country were the greatest drifts of his life."
No one feared not to make himself ridiculous or to exaggerate.
As a 'father' of the cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment in which fear of terrorists and the market breakdown, where the devastated self-evaluation of the Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to maintain dignity.
If, in this hard time without virtue, only a few people can be admired, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he almost embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses both gains: from the foundation that prescribed the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage that died of overdose was founded up to his own brand homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to fight a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of surprise is about to take home high over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize winners, said that the work with Newman was no longer or not less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`We have left the largest of all of us', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who want to live today as Paul Newman lived: receiving high demands of justice, leading a responsible private life far from the cameras.
This is not always simple or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone trying to do it, and Paul Newman was an example of it.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
`What should I eat a hamburger on the street if I have at home Filet?', he often shake himself.
In heaven, he will be proud of the fact that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
"From all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as on those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentionful opa and the Philanthropen," they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not right!
She was called the perfect road, and after my assessment, she was the worst road with everything over and over there.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it, that is what was obviously not done.
But, we're going through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick-up that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem to be bad to me, but if they let you do it, they should also give you everything (including chips to avoid the barrier on the road).
So don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense, which is just going there for this reason) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it so that after the crisis, only small, much cheaper shirts were decided to buy from less fabric?
So well, things like these are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting snake of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road started and we had not let our backpacks lie behind, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to recover.
In addition, it looked like waiting for rain in these 40 minutes, so it came to the temptation to organize a people's uprising and overlap the housing.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear in the classification due to this chip I have received in time, I can already think that the outcome has been mismarked.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, this road would never fall into me.
So I think we will dream for a long time from a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image identification system and the human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the campus of the company). The system observes what it hears during entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face detection system, this 'Receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were clothed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also group those present after the discussions into the groups.
In the presentation video `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not associated with the group that leads to her conversation and that neither is a business employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will soon listen.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impossible
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its operating system Windows.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most needed, instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will be only for the few.
Everything is only one detection if you remember that Microsoft added some function and `Extras' in Windows versions.
The change in direction is worthwhile
Microsoft has the right, the operating system gradually loses meaning, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared in the network, this was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Certainly, many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to allow hardware and software to function at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or his husband when it comes to sharing something with his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of his `Death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention every time to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to perform the Firefox, the Explorer or chrome and we spend more time on surfing every day than in the surroundings of the 'window'.
For what do half the computer serves in existing applications?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need this, without any doubt. I give a small example of it.
I made the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the restoration rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refresher drinking machine, a sign is attached: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google used for the research on the network.
By the way, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso used it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing a well-built pastor.
When we start counting the countless stars appearances, we can resume the image of a very strong man, with a tipy bart, which had raised heavy weights in a hiking circle.
In fact, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, inferior and tailled.
The English speakers call it `tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, exceeds all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, even though it is called in the close circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the origin of the name is connected to sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surpasses all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive Unisex cutting, and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (nearly recognizable) which these T-shirts have as a detail on the neck cut.
And respect, the Belgian company focuses not only on the production of `tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kaschmire, cotton trousers, T-shirts with stripes, babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very harmful to use it as underwear.
You're very charming.
"I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate."
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monthica Cruz is delicious, but full of joy in life.
At present, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monthica, this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, where she is located, and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in the fashion sponsoring the Spanish fashion house.
Blessed and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner of Valentino's honor.
A very intense working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis for your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s, there we find many ideas.
I'm happy to go through a city and watch women as they are clothed, how they combine their clothes, that's what I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe, but finally, everything is in one and these areas have many commonness.
Since I was young, I was enthusiastic with the clothing; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to pour around the garments of my aunt and see her clothes.
That was great to go almost better than to a recreational park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the clothing.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in teaching and in the samples to look into the mirror and feel good at it.
As a actress, when you get the costume, you get into the real performer role.
Finally, everything is connected to each other, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionality.
Recently, you've become 30, didn't you get into a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever, I feel good than thirty-year-old.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've been trying to do since I was young and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, don't you think you're going to be a mother, aren't you?
For a long time, I have already known that I have become a mother because that is what my body demands and I want to be a young mother; that is not what I want to let go.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried about it.
I'm gonna give my child great feelings of happiness and learn it with a lot of love.
With regard to film art, you keep in mind the works you participated in and the last year have been rotated.
That is the same thing, and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and uncalm and wants to have everything at once, of course, that can't be immediately.
I very much wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A few days ago, you appeared on the climb with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the climb to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the well-being event of their organization `Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothing pieces from our collection for Mango were auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
Many things are told about them, as the one she knows would tell you that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this grandhearted thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a hand stand, I will do that too.
To support women in the third world, whatever is necessary.
The drivers who can be relapsed because of the alcohol level will need to install the `Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol level, installed this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholised, the car doesn't jump.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is now part of the General Prosecutorship report, which is a pilot project that will take for a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, and therefore it gets a course for the rehabilitation of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the General Prosecutorship, experienced, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Safety of Cars will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the car drivers who were displayed more than once because of driving under alcohol influence, went back to taxation.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents autostart when the driver has made alcohol test; or if a alcohol concentration is detected higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1 000, the costs are borne by the one imposing the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevented by 65% of the rules in the first year following its introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to attack this behavior before it becomes a crime.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required for the criminal prosecution process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been built in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Members will be voted tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Worker Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been made in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-tos'
With British punctuality at 17:40 p.m., at the time planned by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF Airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force, traveling with Prince and Prince of Asturia.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple that went out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before I asked a taxi driver on the street, whether he knew that the prince and prince of Asturia visited the city to formalise the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people at the airport around this time you're from here or something.
No, she's the Spanish, but she lived a couple of years here.
-Aw, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and prince of Asturia is and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the Hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 soldiers of the Marine, giving honoral salve.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the prince, with long hair wounded by the wind, without ordinary `peep-toes', maybe she was told that it is expected a thunder in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official sequence is waiting.
At the door of the hotel in which they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from the Mexican television awaits them that likes to make scars.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no very excellent fashion designer and bonuses than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and internationally increase young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, yesterday saw her drawings in the show window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
So many events have occurred that are associated with the fact that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken down by pain, because his brother recently died, hurried together. He attracted the suit from the fashion house and occupied some jewelry of ELAH that were stunning. He kept on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters large and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended with the baron of Rotschild without jackets, for they borrowed the lady.
Dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a stange and made a kind of `grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the rooms of the palace, but before she showed us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always calls for a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own beds and towels) at Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starous sky of Paris.
Oh, la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There is not 1000, but a possibility more to forget us chaotic everyday life.
And if there are few, all are gathered in a book in which it stands how to get to relax. The book comes into the books on September 30th.
The wicker is a penalty when he sounds at 7:00 a.m., but even worse the idea seems to come back into the hectic rhythm, which requires the current life to come in.
The office is called the tension and the computer that lead to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to fight the daily exhaustion and the problems of turning off the working world.
However, the number rises, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to Yoga clubs, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents the entire list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual in the book.
The work against stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and thus the rest that the book gives comes into the books of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Who thinks that it is impossible to reach the rest in the areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refuses such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or suggest the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance of the body and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Speaking in Sleep
Some children speak at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be shocked, but in reality this has no significance.
This is a positive sleep disturbance called the talk in sleep.
She is quite widespread, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you were told that you talked at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the child can remember nothing the next day.
There is no single reason that causes this appearance.
There are often links with other appearances in sleep, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, Enuresis noctura (bedding at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fibers, stress situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper, or it can be quite a opposite (shouts, wines, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended that the child be monitored and advised by a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus arises.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleeping disorder that can be treated (for example, sleeping apnoe or stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple prevention measures:
Do not try to stimulate the child before sleeping.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are horrible and something too wild.
For the nervous children who are recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
Once the talk occurs in sleep, the tranquillity is trying to keep.
Remember that it is harmless for the child, and the next day it will not be able to remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you'll get it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
If it shows anxiety after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to consult or find out what reason the child has for fear.
If they understand what it says (what isn't that usual), the child does not put pressure in order to perform a hearing and get out more information.
So you will not be able to achieve this because if the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says, that is why they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you're hearing it at night and knowing his secrets.
Not even as a shit.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that takes just a few minutes.
Illusions...
After a long thirsty stretch, ill houses on the field are finally back at a success course.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played numerous torchances and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, when the attackers had hard to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot was close to the angle, ill houses should dominate the game with lightness, and it was only a change of fonder flick with a distance shot, then herrn with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the footstep to challenge Denmark's defense.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, leaving only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second mid-term should be decisive with first two torchances fought by Riahi and temporals, and at the same time with the first gate for the ill houses through Marais, which was exactly right to accept a ball that had been defensed in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the illhusian gatekeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about 12 minutes later, so that his teammates had to continue to play underpaid.
However, Denmark did not know how to use this and did not encounter any major problems of an illhaeusian elephant, which only took a little back to their defense, except in the last seconds of the game, where the ball passed very close to the late after a great intersection.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flee to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another abstract into the Bretagne.
In view of the determination of the fishermen who blocked the access to several Bretonian and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to find themselves in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him `with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'concreted proposals'.
The president's visit will take place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee established by the British fishermen in order to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the Diesel Prize, which has achieved an average record value of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies become competitive again and secure the working conditions and the payment of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led to the Morbihan and Calvado's protest fairs, which caused barriers of almost ten kilometers of length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not abort.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated with a lock.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning from the early morning to tyres and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvers of the trade ships.
The fishermen of Turballs and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before choosing possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec crisis committee has to decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the debate planned in the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
But some of the British fishermen do not want to be represented by the representatives of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give up at any point' and 'will not go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel costs the litre currently about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be achieved with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died from the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut at the age of 83.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes also adopted by the cinema legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer holds his delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 airplanes delivered this year, despite the threatening recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, holds its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 airplanes delivered, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is expecting a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its planes in the size range of 30 to 120 seats.
So far, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider spending more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of Financial Times, the insured American International Group, which was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, considers to pay more than 15% of its assets to return the 85 billion dollars that were proposed to him.
AIG is willing to control the sale of a large part of its businesses, beyond their life insurance at international level and their age provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the Administrative Board of AIG met Sunday evening to check possible sales.
There was no confirmation at the AIG.
Among the assets of which AIG might separate, their aircraft-leasing-Filial International Lease Financial Corp., their share of 59% in Transatlantic Holding's return insurance, as well as their real estate and their investment in the Private Equity, further explains the FT.
With regard to this sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG has to act quickly on sales in order to repay credits of more than 85 billion that you have granted the Federal Reserve, also on the risk that the US authorities receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders are lost at the same level.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday after the Representative Chamber had rejected Paulson's plan for the saving of banks, a historical case of courses: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of almost 800 points, and the afternoon 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As far as the points are concerned, the strongest case of his history (684,81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of trade decline after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final payments, the Index of Nasday, mainly technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1.983.73, and the widespread standard & poors index of 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan for the saving of banks through the Chamber of Members, which should again allow some stability on the markets, Wall Street, which had already been attacked at the beginning of the quarter, broke together.
On the other hand, with 228 votes, and 205, the Members refused the financial secretary Henry Paulson the means he had asked for.
Nearly two of three republicans rejected his plan.
`Here is a bad picture that represents the Congress as incapable of adopting a plan', said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan', she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days `te late' comes.
`If the project is actually condemned to fail (...), it will be a quick task of the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, Red.) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would restrict the conditions of credit," said Brian Bethune, Head of Economics at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day that passes, the ruin of a financial company' in the United States 'take up'.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the American authorities planned the purchasing of Wachovia's banking business by its competitors Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are not just a American but a global crisis, the analyticist of FTN Financial added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenues of the State Bank within ten years have decreased Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and the revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner for points in the first TV double
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House from Friday followed another to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory for the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats in this television dish, which was to be persecuted by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although very likely, was not `brillant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the election surveys five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, from which a survey was published on Saturday, according to Obama with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
With the unresolved electors, so those on whom it comes now, Obama showed with 39% as winners from the surveys, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as winners.
Obama should be able to confirm his prize on Thursday with the good performance that his competitor Joseph Biden expects at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
`It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not stop to focus on his inconsistent experience in the field of foreign policy and clearly underlined the 'naturality' of his opponent in these questions, which was the center of this first television document.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he emphasized several times.
`I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become President', he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican advertisements since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without being able to get out of the text.
He stressed his ability to make good decisions and renew the image that the world of the United States has.
`McCain has still not understood that Obama already', on the other hand, put a democratic advertisement point on the other hand, in which Republican was accused, not to cover the complete extent of the crisis that lasts on the 'American of the street'.
During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama pleaded before 20,000 people last night who had gathered in streaming rain at a election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'center level' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, which the Americans thinks most suitable to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
`The next week could represent a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative of Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the good economic instincts' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is the final judgement of an eight-year poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After re-emphasizing that he would even be able to reduce the taxes on 95% of Americans despite the variations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energetic independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, was the priority for him.
On the other hand, McCain wanted to create a 45 nuclear power plant by 2030.
The two candidates take care of the questions that were taken on the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (470 billion), which was adopted by the Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
`Have you noticed that a choice took place in Minsk?'
Youths and Opposites demonstrated Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Some hundred white skirts gathered Sunday evening since the closure of the elections on the Minsk marketplace to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, numerous youths had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator is supposed to reverse'.
Some admit that they have not chosen at all: 'What's useful if they do with my voice what they want,' says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown the foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is willing to take place a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-representation of Visa for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the cessation of certain assets, could be repealed if these elections were estimated by the observers as clean.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
`We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the censorship', regretted Potemkin, press speakers of the Union of democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetical change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of pro-Europe movement, because it is important to tell the votes, and this is the executive one with us.
If Members of the opposition take part in Parliament, then because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of intervening in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is strongly debted to Russia, is in a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we are at risk of becoming a protestorate in Russia.
Well, we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the organisation of security and cooperation in Europe, which has persecuted the process of election, does not recognise the choice as valid.
It emphasizes that the number of votes is too high and that the extension of votes in advance (26% of Minsk's voters) has made the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that a choice took place?, the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the two last political prisoners who were released in August this year.
No one was in the electoral places.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most closely in line with the government's ideas.
The silence of the night decreases again over the October square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Disapproval - From blood that was back safe
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her founding, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the most safe and efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she regained the public's confidence, which was severely shocked by the scandal of blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, national blood reserves managed by the blood donation service of the Canadian red cross were contaminated with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Given this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, Canada's government launched in February 1994 a public investigation conducted by Judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and drafting directives to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever still hesitated to submit his report, several provinces at that time set a committee on the legs whose aim was to develop a new system for the administration of blood conservation in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee completed this order.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, almost 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was destructive.
By the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood conservation and through the work in this field during the following years, we have regained public confidence before proudly stressed that in early 2008 almost 94% of Quebec’s trust in Hema-Quebec had in the beginning of 2008.
However, Dr. Décary maintains in consciousness that 'trust is something very fragile'.
Since its founding on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec acts according to the principle of caution.
At this time we experienced the emergence of numerous cases of human form of bovine male in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, which has been headed since the founding of 1998.
`And we did not have the least idea whether this disease could be transferred over blood.
So we called on one of the main directives of the Crever and Gélineau reports, which, as a result, is to apply exclusion measures if you do not know and if a disease is only slowly progressing, as is evidently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which is inevitably leading to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had stopped in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proved that this disease is transferred over blood.
This event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has quite a sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique appeared on the market to detect HIV: the nucleic acid tests (NST) allowing it to demonstrate the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the previously used tests.
The NST enabled it to shorten the incubation time between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be demonstrated by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it was significantly reduced, and one could not recognise this.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via blood.
Today, one of 12 million people is in danger of receiving HIV-infected blood.
`In other words, this means that 12 million blood conservations should be distributed before someone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec spread between 400.000 and 500.000 blood conservations each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case where HIV was transferred over a blood conservation.
I think you can feel comfortable today when you get or write a blood transfusion to restore your health," says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to get the safety of our products.
You never know what disease agent can get into the system.
Only last year the Chikungunya virus has appeared on the island of Réunion, which, just as the West Nile virus, is transmitted through insects over the blood.
We have to monitor continuously," continues Dr. Décary before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec, in addition to a safe supply, also has to provide sufficient supply.
`The need grows because the population is ageing.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or blood plates.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which is an average of only 3% of Quebec's blood donors.
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the appropriate criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On the average, 14% of those who provide their blood are not accepted because they are, for example, sick of AIDS or malaria, and whoever traveled to a country where malaria is spread is excluded from the donation of blood for a year.
`With this 3%, we create an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
No stocks are very rare.
But you need to renew the members of this donor network when they grow older and donate blood.
It is hard to convince people to spend blood, but especially to keep them and to make them become regular donors.
Nowadays, life is so hectic that one rarely finds time to spend an hour in the donation of blood," regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conservations but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which are almost exclusively used in heavy fire injury.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public navel nail blood bank of Quebec.
In the navel snail, previously considered biomedical waste, stem cells are rich blood that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
`A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousands of navel blood samples, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand annually.
`We should start making it available for transplants at the beginning of the next year', explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of navel blood loss as very popular.
"Many mothers are convinced to have no access to it," because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals of Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinal
Montreal's Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1-page (4 to 3 with all gates) against the sounders from Seattle at the second and decide to play the Quarter Final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the overall gate ratio was counted, qualified for the semifinal round of the excretion games of the first league of the USL.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the ninetiest game minute.
After a first half-time without gate for both the one and the other side, the middle field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other matches for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the sounders.
Remember that at the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact, Starfire Complex in Tukwila had introduced a 2 to 1-back in a suburb of Seattles.
In the semifinale Impact is measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 victories in the replay in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps still moved into the semi-final round with a total gate ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
Number 1-Trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Last night, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Placeanec and Andrej Kostitsyn pushed the attack on the Florida Panther with a storm fire, which led to a 3 to 2 win.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, placeanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only gate of all shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, the Russians warned.
I need another game so I can feel. '
`He has fixed himself too much on it in the first half, said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a stormy applause. '
Charest sits on the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the initiation of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister for Health, Yves Bolduc (Linke) attempted to be elected in today's sub-election.
`In the course of our last large border in the north: This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following all the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected after him.
On three huge screens, spectacular pictures of hydropower plants, mines, viewed by Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large resources as during the election period.
By the way of the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he will hold the elections this autumn, even if he said that his calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision', which the Prime Minister is supposed to have for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic space' which provides for an agreement with France on workers, a agreement between Canada and Europe and agreement with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned in recent times in the speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the north - the northern area in the 49st latitude - had never been a topic of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explain why the north was a jewel with enormous potential, but did not call a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
Mostly some views of what could be done more: mainly on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr Charests, the North has `Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `Gebiet twice as large as France' is nearby, is in Quebec.
It is not just near us, it is in us', he emphasized how to show clearly that he is looking for a national reasoning room.
Quebec has grown very well through his connection to the north, he stressed: the road to the gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
`It belongs to us, it's our future,' he added after he had put a theatrical break to look at the huge card behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always requested, said the Prime Minister of the Press.
`This is a traditional attitude that persecuted all governments.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is given, I will resume this position on behalf of the government," he explained.
In addition, `With climate change we have to reconsider our vision from the north', he explained and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be available all year long because of the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the region, the indigenous people and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that Quebec's government would handle them very carefully and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pecist representative of Ungava) have already initiated consultations with about thirty communities.
The work has been taken by a ministerial committee, led by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Transport and Bodenschätze) takes an important place.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity in which 'man will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also go in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan of North will be 'proved, regulated and environmentally-saving', he promised.
Jean Charest described this `Vision' as being a continuation of those of the liberal Prime Minister who were in charge of him.
`As the liberals in front of us, we have thought about transforming the challenges into new growth and development chicks.
By the way, this was one of the ever-introduced topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the adopted decisions provides for a rename of the power plant of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
`Von Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about Lesage, who reached the silent revolution and the state of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James-Buch, always knew our party to determine the future', Jean Charest explained.
The press against he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the program `Roads to the North' from John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Mr Charest stresses that its operation was planned for 2012 in relation to the project Water Power Staudamm Eastmain1a-Ruper.
`This remains among us, but I'm about to be there', he trusted his party members, which caused those controversial towers.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, in fact, has not yet excluded the possibility of holding a choice this autumn, which is possible from the law.
He stressed, however, that its calendar is full, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend gave the Liberal Party Chief a platform of nationalistic plans, especially from ‘the Constitution’ targets, which were adopted without delay: The PLQ calls for the recognition of ‘specificity Quebecs’ in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canada's broadcasting and remote communication and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the Nord Plan were included with Skepsis.
The Chief of the Partie Québécois, Pauline Marois, has re-established the policy of developing the Nord-du-Quebec, which the Landry Government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done it, we would already be much further today, Ms. Marois judged on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has decided to support the adoption of a Nord plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this is not just a big idea," said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letter - A renowned country
Mr. Vic Toews, Ex-'Justiz' minister (the irony) in the Cabinet of Harper, it was the last summer that allowed Louise Arbour to say that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has led a non-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with smash, says just as much about the people around the Prime Minister, as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do this with a government that was the only one in all the countries concerned who did not get home to her countrymen in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was another younger than the things that were being provoked to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its words and lets a child's soldier fight under inhumane conditions.
The only one who goes down to a parody of justice to assess the debt of the defendant.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian lawyers are calling for Omar Khadr to get home so that he can get a fair process in Canada.
This government also closes its eyes to the torture: It doesn't matter that after so many years of pain, a young adult will certainly have been breached forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are just here with a heimly tailored circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly wears like a flag in front of itself, and that sounds so nonsensible from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen can be polluted, tortured, and locked up, quite after gooddoking of a head of government, who is only supported by the minority until now (may he be entirely part of the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation at a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has dismissed the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this dismissal, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The orwellic speech of Barrick Gold
In her edition of 17 September Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orwell logic that the world's largest Golden Winning Society sought a complaint of more than six million against three authors and a small mediumless publishing house, with the aim of opening a publicly transparent debate.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of blasphemy, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely evacuated by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to make a public debate to push everyone into ruins who dares to represent one of their opposed opinions.
No matter how the process is expected, the authors and the publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight against a army of lawyers paid from the almost unfavourable bags of the gold mine.
The tactics in these inequal struggles are, on the other hand, often to ruin the defendants in order to force a consential regime that causes the opposite side and also scares anyone who dares to review the question again.
If Barrick had really wanted a public debate, she had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast, what is going on and going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually carried out in Canada by the exchange of ideas and not by knuppels.
So it would have been sufficient if the gold mine had opened their books and documents and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams that could have brought light into this question.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wise the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a public debate at the same time, but do he not consider the opinions of this public?
It seems that this word in the world of the Vice-President includes only the generous lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very beautiful view of the term.
In democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not understand - is that the public, who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does this especially because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many observe as a knees complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold just addressed a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they ask them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, the complaint of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the truth founding that is fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies in this world, who else can do this then?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment, which we are, has long been aware of getting into control of debates and disagreements and resolving conflicts.
The unproportional complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, unlike what it says, it does not like a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that restrict this kind of unjustified action.
Rescue action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The administration of Bush and the leading Congress Members, Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement over the most extensive economic restoration plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s yesterday.
The new version of the plan of more than 700 billion US dollars to stop the financial crisis that has been shocking Wall Street for months has yet to be adopted by the two congress chambers.
The main content is: a better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new resources to reduce the number of houses held on the basis of payment residues, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the leading employees of the assisted companies.
U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
`We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the market', said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
`It happened everything to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis at Wall Street', said democratics.
`This is the basic point: If we don't do that, the dreama, the chaos and the distress in the daily life of the Americans will be enormous,' the Republican Judd Gregg explained.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that had had been a re-establishing failure on the mood of investors.
The time limit agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who had recently participated in the negotiations, showed themselves rather as advocates of the agreement, but without failing to express their discontent that they had to be met in this extreme way.
The democratic senator Barrack Obama was on the addition of certain arrangements for agreement, especially those to allow the owners to keep their houses, and those who concern the salaries of the leaders of the companies saved by the State.
`If taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the lack of responsibility of certain persons, this is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on the American television stations.
When he was asked on another broadcaster if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details, but I hope so.
`The principles I have read [show] that this is one thing that we all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at using the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis caused by the placing of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage credits (subprime) before extending to other forms of widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally in a freezing of financial power and in the ruins of banks and monetary institutions.
A group of Republican Members was making the first attempt to reach agreement last week fail.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `toxic' assets of companies in distress are only secured by the government and are not to be purchased, one believes that they escape the sackgasse.
In order to round out the perspective for everyone at the congress, one has also added a possibility which states that if the government had to make losses with this programme within five years, it would then be able to raise new taxes in order to retain its capital used.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which can add to another 100 billion if the President sees it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be adopted in a renewed vote of the Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him into dividends in the case of profits and can sell it again when the storm has passed over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to halt the payment procedures relating to the housing bound to the real estate credits covered by this plan and to set deadlines for the repayment and deliberations paid to the leading employees of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Members to vote on him today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not sure that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday there were further votes against this project, both of the Republicans and of the Democrats.
`Ganz obviously doesn't understand Washington', said the Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, his electors.
`Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are trying to ask the taxpayers for the cashbox'.
The democratic deputy Brad Sherman, head of a group at the Congress called 'the Kaukus of the Skeptics', represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three nobel prize winners, have written us to tell us: We ask the convention not to be under pressure, and carefully consider what way is going on,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, we again got the evidence in Europe that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial statement of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The entry into force of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank announced BNP Paribas that it would fail to buy her competitors who are in great difficulties since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis by risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'That's not a lost money, explained yesterday by Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos.
In order to compensate, we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savings and households appreciate, now that insecure times are announced. '
During this time, on the other side of the channel, the British government was just trying to state another bank brought into distress by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that she would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to Northern Rock, which the British government has to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty with the azur blue eyes was his trumpet for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free himself with the charming smile from the narcistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensitivity, and a obvious talent would also have kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly fearful monsters to the world.
But what a big lasting runner!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 on the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he liked and for a long time a kind of rival on the canvas, more careful in his act, certainly also more fragile, but likewise an apostle of freedom and the sponge of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
In 1925 he was born in Ohio as the son of a German Jews and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should arise.
Without excessive ego, extremely quality feature.
Because in him a whole country, in love with the self-made man, was reflected in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War, who studied acting art in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s and then visited the Actor's studio in New York before he had success in the theatre, television, and soon also in the cinema.
Even this man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became second in 1979 at the 24-hour race of Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a show relationship with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also the unknown facets of this mysterious, reluctant, engaged and against the glamour of showbusiness oversensitive stars, whose puzzles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman moved the cinema lovers to dive this weekend, while on the dark screen of memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with him.
Then the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) recalls, and the young man who rejected his sensible wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot sheet roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memorial (1990) is called up to his sensitive Lord Bridge, who is disturbed by a wedding at his high age, which did not fulfill all their promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were in history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graciano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a handful of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean, was resumed after his death and made the Newman in 1956 correctly known.
This sympathic ganove in the superb The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar in 1973 for the best film.
As a bitter and revenge billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, he was.
He's still.
In his course, epochs are united.
The youth knows him mostly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox trainer of a ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen.
With a last role in 2003 as a pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Contrary to several cinema legends, who have withdrawn early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his assets, his prime and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to `Underplaying' when he assessed his all too expressive performance.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, who only flew the roles for a long time.
However, he was rarely playing Sunnyboys as an outside side: neurotics, alcoholics, fieslinge or desperate, with their perfect representation he reflected his abstract and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true feeling of sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, characterized a peculiar women's portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of fine feeling and sadness.
During the flood of honors that took place yesterday about Newman, his close friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) explained extremely: "His presence has improved my life and this country."
Generosity and enjoyment were essential properties of the deceased actor.
Apart from its legendary career, a great fighter of civil rights, environmental protection and the independent cinema, a opponent of Hollywood's abdrift, is now going to go.
We may have seen him often with the foot full of vinaigrette, in sauces, bakes or other foods, and this was quite tasteless, although we found it funny at the beginning.
However, the profits from his sales fled into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Immer and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. '
And for us it was an honor to persecute the lives of such intelligent and generous American actors.
An exemplary citizen, in the closest and most wide-ranging sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of surcharge &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal process begin against János grant and its complications.
In particular, the defendant will be accused of participation in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent injury and business fraud, and other offences, including document faking.
According to the prosecutorship, the funds qualified by tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often carried out with counterfeit invoices.
State funds and grants from self-management - a total of HUF 65 million - are supposed to be partly flown into the cabinets of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly into the private cases of individuals.
As the inquiry authorities announced, the payments of tenders were subject to fictional invoices, and the associations should not have complied with their obligations.
According to the claim, a large number of invoices should have been faked.
The invoice blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies should be issued the invoices was decided on that round trip north of the Plattensee to which Isván Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices on consumers to be able to issue invoices based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Management of Budapest.
These invoices should have been manipulated by István Lados and his complicities, András 北ri, with the latter responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tours" was a beer site.
As two invoices issued by Biztos Pont Egyesület are to be found in 2003, the gastronomy business is supposed to have preserved the ninety-country group of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company indicates that such a large group wouldn't at once fit into the local.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation Jobb Jövůért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can not accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests should have stopped according to the invoice.
The imagination of the invoice counterfeiters was apparently no limits as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose accounting documents of the clients Jobb Jövůért and Hoppá did not appear at all.
As Managing Director Gyůzů Farkas told the hvg.hu, he immediately realized that it was false documents when documents were submitted by the Prosecutorship during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were wrongly fitted on the stamp."
And further: In addition to form errors, the fact was also wrong that the operation was supposed to have accommodated one hundred people after they have a total of eleven rooms that impossible to offer so many people space.
Also on the account, the restaurant has been no longer in operation for a long time.
The emerging counterfeiters have also absurd to check that the Budapest Travel Office taken by them offers travel abroad exclusively, and thus they have indicated Hungary-Reisen on the cash payment account, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
Moreover, as it was known during the investigation, they have also referred to the invoices of VAT, although travel agencies relating to a country outside the EU are free of added value tax.
In total, the amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Stichting Jobb Jövůért, since the company accounted for only 25 percent of VAT, the employees also issued exclusively machine bills, but the falsified documents were handwritten.
Another error that had been interrupted by the reporting agents was that in a case they had given "war transport" as a performance provided, although this was not offered by the company specialised in investment consulting, the prosecutor notified.
Further form errors - false invoice format, wrong stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be revealed as counterfeits.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Sports Camp Kunfehértó, whose managers regretted to have never issued the invoices.
Another "defect" is the falsifier at the hib Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was in resolution at the time (2001) when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore indicated that the invoices were not issued.
Conscious False
The other group of invoice investors is persons who were quite aware that they would have to put fictional invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, at a height of about 4 million HUF.
According to the claim, the Managing Director of the Colla Kft. was persuaded by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to the exhibition of the fictional invoices.
The Biogate Kft, currently also in liquidation, is supposed to have co-worked with surcharge and co.: In 2003, the GmbH intends to provide the Foundation Jobb Jövůért Alapítvány, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vorösfenyů Egyesület with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which relates to non-profit services.
However, there was also little payment traffic, since the invoices were canceled immediately after their exhibition, which the persons concerned have forgotten in their documents.
The third group of invoice investors shall include persons directly linked to the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postal boats of the Ukrainian Managing Director of the Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company located in Budapest, but not found there.
This company should have issued several invoices about the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF from October to December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment kft from Kiskunhalas was supposed to have operated as buyers of these invoices since 14 September 2005.
Managing director of this company was a Romanian that Iván Kubatov also had to issue the company documents between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Cubatov has been presenting invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their counterpart.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. are supposed to have been founded by Romanian Maurers on Iván Kubatov's explicit wish.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the complaint, was of lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: on request of his complicity, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned to prepare the company's foundation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with award, such as atlas and Y-Generáció.
In total, Cubatov is expected to have issued 15 invoices in total of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations.
The prosecutor assumes that Cubatov could have collected 10% of the total of the accounts and VAT each.
Kubatov should have even misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional invoices - in this case the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért issued their applications to the socialist organisation, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500.000 forint, but benefited from these amounts.
In order to hide this, they presented five fictional bills of the Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
In addition, these invoices were ensured during the examination of the office of Árpád Kemecsey at the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, a number of defendants are now charged with a consent on the practice of fake accounting, as they have already been filed before the prosecutor.
A sensation could be if János, the main indignant, decided to grant a comprehensive consent.
His previous information was less detailed, and even though he had already agreed several times to report extensively about everything, his consent is still out of place.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in its interest, whether the Socialists have completed a pact with him with regard to the rehabilitation of the large part of the damage caused by HUF 50 million and whether the grant is willing to take responsibility.
It is possible, however, that surcharge now plays the "familiated" after his attempt to alleviate the imprisonment and house arrest had hit deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused far greater damage with economic offences and have not compensated them are on a free foot, or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains denied.
The psychology of the overboy - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, the buyers tend to spend more and thus to over-evaluate the celebrations.
Neurologists and economic researchers of the University of New York have now been able to discover the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to give themselves in a competition, such as a auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play lotto while the other participated in a gambling action - in both cases the active brain regions of the volunteers were investigated by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain ring, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the opponent’s overboying plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore said that price increase was explained by avoiding an overreaction of the Striatum.
In order to undermine their thesis, the economists in the research group have further investigated the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups should offer to a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, and then they made their interventions.
In addition, another group was promised $15 reward, in the case that they come out of the game as a winner.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which were also lost in the case of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, only that the emphasis on the one was on the win, while the other was on losing.
As evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologians, however, the members of the group playing "contrary to losing" were ready for higher inputs than those in the control or "winn" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
They have only founded the practices observed in auctions so far with the joy of gaining, or risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved thanks to the illustrative neurological process, so that we now have a third explanation parat" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor be consulted?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected persons is estimated at a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the concept of collecting for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellow insufficiency are common, but the pathogens and the diseases differ from one another.
Depending on the pathogens, hepatitis viruses are spread into two different types: in hepatitis A and E, the digestive tract (e.g. by contaminated foods or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, secret or speak).
Travellers are advised to vaccine against viruses A and B, in any case, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are about two-three weeks after the consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by inconvenience, weakness, abdominal pain and breeding.
Afterwards the yellow addiction occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery may last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from the diseases caused by hepatitis B, much more severe, such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected in medical treatment is.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, as the ignorant destructions the liver cells in secretly - in many cases the first symptoms are shown after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who have been subjected to blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of patients with chronic hepatitis C is estimated to be 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease is already demonstrated in routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the doctor in the first signs of unknown origin.
It is recognisable that the disease is healable, the virus can be eradicated, causing the risk of infection and preventing cancer.
The 30th September is the World Day of Hepatitis, for the first time in 2004 of patient secretions worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen the consciousness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research results show that religious faith is acting like a kind of "smalling agent" that has already had the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: It has been examined how much faith in God affects human sensitivity, the British sheet "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks each, while studying a painting of the mother of God.
As the results showed, believers were able to disable most of the pain.
By means of a brain-scan technology, it was even possible to prove that Catholics could activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for pain-regulation.
The investigation was the first to participate in a research project, alongside scientists, as well as philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
When trying, a funky device was connected to the left hand, which gave the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: one picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the vision of the virgin Mary would cause a kind of religious trance among the believers while they chose Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from other paintings and felt soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and at this time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should see either the religious, or the other paintings.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "in security" in the sight of the mother of God, as if they were "caused" and they had felt "calm and peace".
While considering religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in sight.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also tried, said that you could also produce similar effects with other, strongly active images in the atheists, you would just have to find the corresponding photo.
"We have to find a picture that triggers very positive feelings like a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality and do it in many cases," says Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question of what effect a Madonna image Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulating of believers.
Would the high-quality virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're telling about you
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with fug and right: it can be found in the bags of people just as about her heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what they move.
And so still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of Google.
In the direction of skeptics, plagued by Orwell's horrorvisions, he lets you align: these would just overlook the essential of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main goal of Google is to collect even more personal data about users and thus draw closer to the original target of the company, which they want to "organize all the information of this world".
Schmidt said that after ten years of changing work, Google was still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked for the status Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished that Google would be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits to me?" but are software programs not yet able to know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which were searched, and the visited sites.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and to take back on it later so that the results can be generated much more precisely, and on the same logic, the so-called "recommendements" that the system recommends customized products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, the users wonder what happens in the case of data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company, which is frightening, and less the sense of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire for the power that arises in many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed to third parties in the case of the occasion, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet users.
A parade example of this has recently been the action against pedophilia in Brazil, where Google provided information to the Brazilian government collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the pedophilia.
However, for personal rights concerned users were still able to breathe up in May when Google, together with the Civil Rights Organization, was successful against the FBI in court: so Google can also be forced to publish information to the FBI on a secret request in the future with no point of the Constitution.
(In fact, the Federal Government has successfully produced the issue of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms referring to the youth protection law adopted years ago, but it has been reserved the list of individual users, or their web and search terms lists to two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who dismiss their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimacy by using the Google services, scourge the company with the conservative embarrassment.
However, the American "Geek culture", which is present in many countries and enthusiastic in computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even if both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require any identification codes to its users, in contrast to Microsoft, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, continuously updated source code and program package seem to be much more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software guitar.
On the other hand, the Geeks look through the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet knife - a relationship which has been centralized in particular in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" concerns nothing but collaboration, speak, the users will deliberately leave tracks and use the available communication channels, and even if the sizes are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show itself publicly.
An average youth can simultaneously manage his profile on several Community portals - from Facebook over Xanga, it can connect through other services such as Twitter, or musical services such as last.fm, and can finally integrate all of this into a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. Furthermore, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are geosted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples proves: When considering the party photos last night, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is abandoned because in his blog he is only too honestly making his anger about company management - one is sure: The term "Privatsphere" has been completely re-interpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he gives of himself - such as you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even to handle the Google Monopol, can do this - such as with Scroogle, a tool that, although attacks Google's search engine, will not deliberately leave any traces behind.
Not a few people are deliberately not registering on Community pages so that they are not found, but also Google's online applications, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be dealt with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and thus not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the fasterly introduced services not only make Microsoft but also other software developers head breakdowns.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counterpole: For example, the company's management has completely rejected a protest from the employees after doubled the fees of the company's own kindergarten, and the management also said that the multi-payment of the employees is too costly. However, all of these are quite gentle against the fact that Google went into the knee in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement that all regime-critical hits, or those who violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal regulation of the Group is that no new service will be applied in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could reverse somewhat strongly: While some think that Google's book and magazine scan/archiving project now assumes that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the "Health" system that enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors already delivers the fabric - e.g. "Scroogled", which describes famous novel by Cory Doctorov in best orwell Manier a future in which a person will be frighteningly close thanks to Google's data.
Two youths help the double killer of Ózd to remove tracks
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police has now interrogated two young people who are suspected to have helped to remove the traces, the spokesman of the police commissioner Borsod informed on Tuesday.
The young people were ordained, they are currently being accused of the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, it is two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened by a freedom penalty of up to five years.
The suspicion of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was investigated on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having murdered several people out of money greed.
In the course of the investigation, it has been shown that the 23-year-old had debted a larger amount of a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to compensate for his debts, so he lured his believer to a site in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murder with a gun hidden at the place of crime.
Together with experts, the police are now examining the weapon of action and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers purchase for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw stock exchange offered for the hundred percent purchase of the stock packages of the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warschauer Börse, confirmed the offer that Poland had put, despite the fact, that they had previously been excluded by the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw stocks belong entirely to the state.
99% of the shares is in the hands of the Polish State, but they want to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily newspaper "E15", Poland's offer includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have been offerings so far.
Petr Koblic, Chief of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that from all the interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner, and he did not exclude that this could even lead to the closure of Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of Prague stock exchange to 5-10 billion crowns.
According to shareholder agreements, 90% of shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent investment, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their ever-increasing international financial crisis comments on Tuesday, some leading European leaves already spoke of "Two September 11".
The global financial disaster has been due to the American President, for example, to "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to reverse his own party for the draft law which should bring some relief into the distressing situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the milliard-hearted investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "two September 11th".
Parts of the press in Madrid also ordered the Sinbock in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of collapse.
The American financial system threatens to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, it is now threatening the danger that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy is in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
You can no longer overlook the threat, for example, the Geneva says "day advertiser".
While some countries could still provide their banks with rescue packages in the wake, saving banks from bankruptcy with the money of taxpayers.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are or more banks are pleading, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, the EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weakening money institutions, the Vienna standard recalls. Furthermore, the newspaper continues to be more realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers would have to take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not been seriously confronted with the crisis which is now fought like a tsunami over the old continents.
The "returners" would not have to "wedle" immediately with several hundred billion euros, but it would be advisable to hold in which case it would be reasonable to take up the money of the taxpayers to eliminate even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies for accident prevention if not to imitate natural obstacle sensors?
For example, those of the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired to create new accidents of preventive systems.
In collaboration with the Tokyo University, Nissan has built the biomimetical system of type BR23C, a mini car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that prevents any collisions.
At the flight each bee forms its own oval "Private Area", which is very similar to our own "Shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology-PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in every direction and in an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers picked up the idea of the laser controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a 180-degree face field within 2 meters, calculates its distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately initiates the collisions avoiding process.
The obstacle is recorded in seconds, and the authorobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this manoeuvre takes place purely instinctive.
"If it wasn't, the authorobot couldn't react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the authorobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innerest and most vulnerable part of the protective sign - a layer within the accidents currently considered unavoidable.
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of bees when they avoid other bees.
And that must be in the fraction of a second.
However, retirement, unlike the bees, cannot be up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, in the direction of the tyres.
While the bees here are infinitely open to avoid other bees, the scientists were able to use only the rotary movement, or acceleration and abbreviation.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and energy-efficient and therefore have a longer lifetime than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less to the processing of the data, and less to the ability to store it.
This device must only process some inputs per second and respond to them accordingly.
It doesn't have to save it, or on the basis of previous manövers produce an intuitive, logical reaction, so it's taking only a handful of KB memory in the course of time.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collisions prevention technology, which, according to Nissan's assessment, will be in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the driver around obstacles and thus leads him to the target.
A name for the sinful child
Now, the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar's serious rescue package law is available, which will be applied in several stages and aims at buying the poor credits of the banks.
In the first pass, half of the money will be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight, East Coast, the Congress Delegates, after multi-day debates, went through to an agreement on the 700 billion dollar heavy rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the American House, and said that the agreement should only be put into paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the program will show effect and it will be efficient, but it will have to do more. According to Pelosi, it was not about the rescue of Wall Street, but about the restoration of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, so Washington's time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European Time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), but has not triggered an altitude flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Members first agreed on the draft law on the stabilization of the economy of 2008, then the Senate is on the row.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration that the $700 billion should be issued at once for purchasing fabulous, with loans of charged securities.
In a first tranche, up to the half of the 700 million contribution will be issued, with 250 billion immediately available after the convention is expected to vote over the Causa on Monday. This sum is intended to be used for the purchase of credit-related, bad securities, and the next 100 billion USD is intended to decide.
The programme is reviewed by a Commission of its own, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactics: It can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-loaded securities, or other "toxic" credits.
As responsible persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the undertakings concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying resources and pays the undertakings due fees to the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said that the law defines the necessary resources so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as immediate aid to the American financial system, whether for the large purchase of bad resources, insurance or the avoidance of a system risk triggered by the collapse of a larger monetary institution.
We set the steps we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it was signed, says Paulson.
However, the bosses of banks who are in trouble and now dependent on state aid can expect that their completions, called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas-snake salopp, are reduced by the government.
A reduction in salaries will only exist in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry purchases in the context of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed unless the dispatched head of bank is deported to the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of fabulous loans, the government will aggressively act in order to ensure that managers will not be exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions only refer to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts are regulated by law on manager salaries, the Democracy Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the action.
The State gains participation rights in participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank gets better.
The draft law provides for the President to submit a proposal to the Congress for the next five years, how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
That is not what the American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect the money of taxpayers at all, says the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said that the measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapses of Wall Street.

Prices in paper production as well as in the publishers and in the printing industry remained unchanged.
In other branches of the processing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the major domestic sales markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, mainly as a result of the gas price increase introduced on 1 July.

In consumer goods production sectors a price increase of 6.8 percent was noted, with investment goods a price reduction of 1.4 percent.
The export prices of the industry measured in Forint increased by 1.1 percent compared to the previous month in August, but in the year comparison there was a decrease of 3.9 percent.
The domestic currency became by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, the dollar decreased by 7.1 percent, and compared with the rate of August 2007, it increased by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, even 15.9 percent in the dollar.
No more visa in the US from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-Hungarian Visum Agreement to enter into force around the 12 years, as the Foreign Minister explained before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
They believe that "all things are still dependent on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in overseas in time."
However, it also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The director of Hungarian diplomacy will take negotiations in Washington from now on.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will give her the "Midtlere Conservation Cross with Star" to the Republic of Hungary, and also conducts discussions with the foreign policy consultants of the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the large American parties, have granted their support to the 700 billion dollars rescue package for banks on Sunday. However, there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and Representatives of the Government have announced after day-long marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they have reached an agreement on the Banking Regulatory Package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the uptake of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country from the economic crisis.
Following recent surveys, Obama has been able to further expand its prime thanks to the economic themes, while McCains Hoch, who has swept the presentation of the Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention.
At a election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will quickly accept the law of the $700 billion.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passages of consumer protection which it supported.
"We have to act now, with responsibility (...) - your jobs, your savings, whole industries, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened" he said 35,000 spectators before.
He hasn't missed calling McCain's economic visions as "obsolet".
In an interview given to ABC, McCain explained: "We will all be difficult to chew... but nothing is certainly not an alternative."
The Republican senator said that the plan also prescribed the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the completions for top managers - something he had to do with.
The CBS said Obama that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, informed that the House of Members will probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking room
The right camp is intact, only the voters became self-conscious within the camp - so commented "The mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-sided German news magazine Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria over decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch breakdown is at the same time a problem of Christian democratism, as well as for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the desaster of the CSU did not come, but on Sunday something has ended, but it was quite exactly ten years ago: the unquestionable Hegemony of a State Party
For ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell for the first time under the 50 percent mark since the 1950s.
This repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestags elections, so still in the many quoted Stoiber-Ära.
The consistent modernisation operated by the CSU in the federal country has ultimately destroyed her own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but at the pace, considerably estimated, but without effect, the secularization, education success, the accession of East and North Germans to the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain on the faithfulness of the CSU elections.
Modernisation is always taking place with options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the electors within the camp became more critical and more self-conscientious.
It is noteworthy that in recent weeks the classical civilian groups expressed the largest distance to CSU: free professions, commercial citizenship and electors with abitur, such as university degrees.
Here the support of the CSU dropped to even below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in her "Who with whom? Party chiefs holding back in coalition issues" titled articles on the chaotic domestic situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions for discussions, while the Greens do not want to define in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders hardly let their cards look.
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very well possible - in some federal countries and in the social partners, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP Chief as a Vice Chancellor, was open to Faymann.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the Schüssel-Molterer-Kurs.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
However, Molterer has responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said when Faymann tried to intervene in internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in coalition, is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed within the framework of the ÖVP.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are willing to accept government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The Devil of Poverty and the Segregation must be broken through
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which is being oriented by the President-in-Office of the European Council of France.
In its speech addressed to the plenary session, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEPs of the European People's Party, particularly the education segment, since it is one of the most serious violations of the law that the Roma children face, this is also the greatest obstacle to their needs.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civilian organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the EP Members of Fidesz noted, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job-seeking, Roma would be forced from the labour market mainly because of their low level of education.
"The predominant majority of Roma youths have no middle education, and thanks to poor basic education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree."
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right which has been a key role in applying other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
According to the Members, it is important that these connections become aware of as wide as possible, i.e. Roma and non-Roma.
As soon as a Roma student starts school, its chances to become a productive member of the labour market are increasing, and through income and turnover taxes they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma have to be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - bad and segregated education needs to be discontinued" says Lívia Járóka.
The honourable Member said that a common, target-oriented and negotiating action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the deregulation process in the education sector, and that the proper compliance of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"We have to break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic possibilities to contribute to the future of Europe as fully justified citizens," Járóka demanded.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the preparation of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national level in the sense of the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the decouple of elections, no heads still roll, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the personnel debates were dismissed.
Vice-President Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace takes.
About the fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17% voting loss is decided on the last October week on the extraordinary party day.
However, the much sheltered duo has already made it clear that it does not want to stick on their chairs.
They want to reassure the angry group and the party base, which demanded a day after the "Bayerian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of individual consequences.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career level - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
The CSU was 46 years of "all-in-regulators" in Bavaria, which produces 18 percent of the German GDP.
The conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern country, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party internal restructuring, the potential successor Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Agricultural Minister Horst Seehofer is also involved in the exploration team, which leads with the liberal FDP, or the legally directed "free electors" broadcasting talks about a possible Munich coalition.
One irony of the fate is that with the list "Free Electors" the Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature, whose anti-Stoib appearance first used the Huber-Beckstein Duo to serve the deliberate politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilization of Becksteins.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the threads out of the background, has become an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called "the bitterest day of his political career" on September 28th.
On Monday Huber made a few poisonous comments towards CDU - he believed the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed much to success at national level in 2005, should not be put to the legs with a joint force act, Merkel cannot again become Chancellor after the Bundestags elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a healing from her disappointment over the Fiasko, believes that the terrain loss of the CSU will not have a negative effect on the large coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of social democrats continues.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no Member of the opposition has succeeded in the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers think that this lies in the prosperity and stability in the country guided by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects lawlessness in the counting of votes.
The OECD, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million-inhabitant state has come out for decades without opposition. Nevertheless, the counterparty gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before the votes in the past seriously hoped that Lukechenko, who renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the unfair elections and a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "let" some Members of the opposition in the Parliament.
Therefore, the ODS even took distance from the previously planned boykottes.
Ukraine is increasingly dependent on the rising prices of natural gas imports from Russia. For the reduction of price increases, even loans have been received, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country, to the Russians. In the light of the expectations of opposition, the Ukraine wanted to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukaschenko and other high-level politicians have access to the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
For a temporary relaxation, the evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements, rather than the deficiencies, such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticized the campaign on Monday - that is why oppositionelle should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Nevertheless, the opposition is able to recognise a improvement in the political system: Political prisoners were set freely, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to recognise the independence of the deceased Georgian provinces of South East Asia and Abchasien, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on paper, has regarded the two territories as independent for one month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our sheet.
According to the 2006 presidential elections' opposition candidates, it is desirable to continue, although "the mighty have been afraid to leave only one oppositional in Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in the light of the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for an economic reform to voters.
"We have to fight with many problems here - the opposing newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities will put us in the way of distribution stones, but yet I see that more and more people support the change, even the older ones" said Milinkewitsch in suggestion that not even the most supportive layer of the pensioners agrees with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only earning is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the debt of the country and to the increase in trade deficit, it is just a question of time until the "social security" compulsory to the silence of a cemetery begins," says Milinkewitsch.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of Mission of the Community Independent States, the news agency Ria Novosti stated: "The people believe the actions, and not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore evidence of the maturity of Belarusian electors.
Brunetta: "From now on, it's being frozen before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are turnable doors for the entrance and exits of officials.
From now on, the measure will enter into force against those clauses that are first stamped off and then go to coffee drinks during the working time.
The new 'Anti-Faulpelz-Gesetz' was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Ministers.
">"Drawable doors are a means to increase labour efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," Brunetta underlines again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of the turnable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no opposition from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, therefore, there is no more breakfast during working time; end with coffee or Croissant.
Brunettas advises in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino works miracles at 7 a.m.".
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Publica Amministrazione)
by Rome, the Minister announced that "in three months the absences of officials have reduced to 50 %, i.e. 60,000 people per year are more present at work".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"The wage dynamics - the Minister said - have been twice as large as the private sector and far above the inflation rate in the last 8-10 years."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined together to counteract the Brunetta Decree in the context of the call supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Service profiles itself with figures on lower reductions in work - according to the Consumer Centre - the people grow uninterrupted by the 'activ fauls'.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have gathered together in order to explain the conflicting standards of the Decree the war."
In particular, before the Regional Administrative Court (TAR), additional financial compensation for work-related diseases will be combated, and the planned extension of the compulsory home arrest of the sick worker, during which checks can be made and further aspects of the Minister's renewal will be contested.
Napolitano: "Research against accidents is crucial"
Every day, 2500 work accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 life-long disabilities remain.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents of work were about 1200.
These figures prove to be the seriousness of a phenomenon, which causes almost twice as many deaths as caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazional Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will take the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents in all the provinces of Italy in order to direct the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention at work is.", the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirms in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its "great appreciation for the constant commitment to preventing jobs, protecting the injured workers, supporting the victims' families and awareness of public opinion".
"A devastated "basta" has raised itself in this regard; understandable for tragedies that, measured by their size, cause some spine into the media and participation of the public. However, the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is, at least, a resource problem: there must be decisive investment in education and information."
A special significance is the numerous initiatives for more direct consciousness in school frames by young people who feed themselves to the working world.
It is our duty to focus the attention on this phenomenon and not to distract from his social seriousness.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "as the phenomenon of the work-related deaths represents an urgent social emergency which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all the institutions to work on decisive rules aiming to put an end to the problem".
"The data of the work accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is too high," stresses President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy at the end."
"How do you think that you are doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against it by various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting at school".
"A further effort is needed - it adds - as regards communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility from employers is required to face a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli also spoke of "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the accident victims of work" and pleaded "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a warranty on insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident is not dependent on voluntary or random donations decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player under charge: Danger of hearing damage
Sound music over a longer period of time with portable musical devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This will report to the European Commission, which is quoted by the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report that is distributed in Brussels.
"The report, says a note, makes it clear that 5-10% of those who hear loud music with portable musical appliances for at least five years a week longer than an hour a day, risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am worried that such a large number of young people who usually put portable musical devices and mobile phones on a high volume, are harmful to their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – it is said by the Eu – show a clear risk that pushes too fast action.
What is really important is to sensitize consumers and make this information common.
In view of these scientific insights, we need to review the already existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep step with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"The scientists, thus conclude the EU Communication, confirm that one is too concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other members of the European Union and the affected, will now examine the necessary measures to protect children and adolescents better from the noise that comes from portable musical instruments and similar devices."
There is already a European standard, which limits the level of noise from portable musical appliances to 100 dB.
You can limit these damages very much, in which you take solutions such as the reduction of volume and length of sound.
In their report, the U.S. Scientific Committee pointed out that if users of portable musical appliances hear only five hours a week (lauder than 89 decibels) music, so that the legal limits are already exceeded, which apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross this border risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
So this was 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Roma, Alemanno gives the start of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, we're supposed to be over in March, in June, we're gonna get out of balance.
This is the expiry defined by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". The Commission has reached its new seat this morning behind the Caracalla thermals.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the Guidelines for Rome.
Once the project will be completed, the City and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Oberbürgermeister Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," says Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains in the City and the municipal council.
There is no re-distribution of competences, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March its task will be terminated and the Commission will re-establish as such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June - the Supreme Mayor announced - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the Commission's work."
Anyone questioning the competence of the Commission, since its opinion is lacking liability, responds to Alemanno: "Everything depends on the Commission's work and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is dealing with the everyday problems and emergencys that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The captain mayor of Rome is of great importance to clarify the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to reflect. It will address the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetically nor statically to enable our city a quality jump - which it really needs - and thus to do a common step in the future".
A future, according to the Supreme Mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself to the current local borders, but will look much further," not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American President?
A well-known American politician who is much about being regarded as independent wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-american president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, decimated the economy of the US and kept relations with the opposed Islam (and still does this as a private man today)".
The attacks against Obama are becoming increasingly stronger, just now where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a web page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very frequent: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!".
However, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; all say that Obama will win with a great prize.
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in her editorial: only in the election cabin we will probably know who the true American patriot will give his voice.
Here is a mentality of the US, which has been concealed to the end.
"Say what you want, then we will decide to whom we will make our crews, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll move from America.
Something you never heard before – only now where the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What error has Bush committed during his term of office? 89% replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a step in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its traces with journalists: In the newspapers you can already feel the reductions, and many accuse the Internet, the "mother" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control about the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really worry about the information concerning the competent authorities because of the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems come through the shortcomings of the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that must be solved – the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, does not significantly shrink.
A clear but complicated pessimism is today fulfilling the American journalist.
Six of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalistism at national level is on the wrong way.
In the local field, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in what direction the web is going on.
The main publishing groups take the way to the Internet, which is considered by many as the "ciller" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to want to join the new technology in hope "they bring something good for journalistism".
Today, the biggest risk exists in American journalism between the head editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of head editors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level only 23% are.
Some think it has to do with the "Security in Work".
The operators who fear to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists have 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "redacters", Anm. d. Red.) is always a topic in the US.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as it are the US, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and Internet operators, employers like it offer them popular and so it will be a question of taking it or leave it.
The chief editors often get very high wages, but the editor can sometimes get only 10000 euros per month, including pensions and insurance funds.
As far as the holiday is concerned, the matter is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they admit themselves, are often "ill" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: IN THE ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the second chamber of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate broker, which had been asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola because of bankrot in the context of the investigation on the counter-compliance in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the course of the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the Province City to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such impositions (contrary to which the prosecutor had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence of accusation to him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Members voted against the 700 billion dollar parcel of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the previous edition of the New York Times, which reports of how the crisis in the course of the course of the Republican Party is divided into its old and moderate East Coast-Seele, which always favored the state institutions and the business community, and that neoconservative, which is hostile to the "in Washington" and the financial world, and wins electors in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise by the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is known or even already present: not only in the USA, even in the west, and perhaps beyond them will be affected by them.
Both in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-time feared events which finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of this phenomenon is the new discovery, the unheard renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a degradation of banking and financial institutions, which have close links to abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of assets of private households living in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments: how it is to behave with the families concerned, which are also a huge electoral mass.
So the crisis appears economically global, and politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been so disadvantaged and lost its right of speech: the clear evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its disagreement, has not been able to find a common path in various national and international conflicts.
Therefore, all of them now expect the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, for example, distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become more serious, only the US are in the economic situation to save themselves without foreign aid.
In addition to the resources, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two non-experienced conditions – in certain circumstances – which, otherwise, no international organisation or market will be able to withdraw in a similar way.
That new repression, which is put on the state-national element, is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing significance which is recently linked in the economy with a very closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is now when we were so convinced that we have ever entered into a networked realm, in a realm of ever-different technologies, the immaterial that we have to find at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although they can certainly all be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are still connected to an extremely defined piece of earth – one territory.
That is why the person who has such a territory is beneficial to another person living in an unacceptable, waterless or oil-free area.
I am now coming to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short intake.
Whoever territory, whoever government, who says politics, also says Leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergatory phenomena.
On the one hand, the knowledge of the need for respected Leaderships is the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is a wave of disarmament about the existing leaderships, e.g. those of the economy, which have escaped as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, industriousness, an image of inefficacy, a feeling of distance, which all focuses on a whole class of managers of Western countries.
It seems to be the way of conviction among large parts of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their ideas world, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is the majority of which is always foreigner and overcoming.
The demand for Leadership thus nourishes underground a tremendous but powerful movement of the destruction of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the electors and in the unmeasured revolt of the collective state of the last time: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the U.S. Members against Bush (and may also play a role in the victory of the right in Italy).
One gains the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems, and therefore less representative value in what is going on in the lower social layers of the West today, and is still strengthened and driven by the financial crisis to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes far open is surely not.
The super sticker that lets go up on walls
The forces of gravity to defeat thanks to a adhesive and to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, of which one of them seems to have reached almost the target.
With an adhesive on a surface of only 2.5 sqcm, it has been possible for the researchers to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material found by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanor tubes.
"The principle of the adhesive can be imagined as a series to a pile of spaghetti-ordered tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, covered by microscopic hardships that give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with various materials such as Glass Teflon and Schleifpapier have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "let it be easy to remove from the wall," says Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
AN MAUERN ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as a versatile adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Something like Spiderman to get up on walls? Perhaps already, but the researchers think more of a less fascinating advantage, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanor tubes are as well heads of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application may fall within the area of space.
So for the moment the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF THE FORSCHING – also the University of Berkeley, California, devotes itself to a new type of adhesive.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, the California scientists present a glue made of micro fibers that clean themselves like hair by moving on a surface itself from dust and thus always maintain perfect liability.
Medicinal products: Never take with fruit juice
Caution for grapefruit, orange juice and apple juice.
These beverages, which are consumed because of their refreshing quality and their vitamin riches v. a. in summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken together with certain vital medications, as they can affect the intake of them by the body in extreme ways.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaging and fresh fruit juices in connection with medication. In the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he repeatedly made alarms: A glass of apple, orange or grape fruit juice is sufficient to reduce the ability of certain vital medications to eliminate them practically and thus endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medications such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiolytic medicines, anxiolytic and neurologic agents, up to to to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS IN FAHR – The same agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago against the dangers of this mix and stressed that what is drunk in conjunction with medicines such as Diazepan or Metadon.
It's NOT GRAFFRUIT – according to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of the active substances occupied by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, Michele Carruba, Director of the Università Statale di Milano, appealed: "Some results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers who are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still uncertainties, to have no shame to ask an pharmacist or physician," the Expert of the Ansa Agency emphasizes.
Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel price is to the American Paul Krugman for its analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the economic and foreign policy of Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of enron breakdown, Krugman claimed in a editorial article of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the US than the attacks.
A prediction, which was given little polemics as an answer and was presented to the economy years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked about how fast the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public field," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economy of great value", but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style, which is especially directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software as a free replacement for Microsofts Office wins an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both under freezing and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the audience with some new features: in addition to a revised and now economically designed initial menu, a reason for secure compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x is finally achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, which is the latest standard ISO version.
In addition, attention was paid to compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which e.g. facilitate sending via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time keeping the original look of the page.
Thus you can also generate "hybride" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed several times by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a fragment to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just trying to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the next few weeks the definitive result is to be made public.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
The program for Windows and Mac OS is also available for Linux operating system.
On request you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
However, free of charge may be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme into the private households, so it is also in the field of business where OpenOffice could succeed in the great throw: in the end, several public administration and schools have already transferred to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training offer, which means optimum help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text generation program; Calc, the table program targeting Excel displacement; Impress, for the creation of presentations such as Powerpoint; Dbase for the operation of databases instead of more known access; and lastly Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can also be easily exceeded by 3 million and 600 thousand already.
Coal also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens a new Dopingfall mi framework of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athletes Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is a third-classified and winner of the Trikot of the best climber.
The message published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who has been tested positively for Cera, the third generation Epo. Previously, the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher met.
The analysis from the blood samples of coal belong to those performed by the laboratories of Lausanna and Chatenay-Malabry in recent weeks.
If the counter samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The Chief of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and according to the Associated Press also the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans to the podium and also claimed the tricot of the best climber for himself.
THEMA INSTITUTION: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRAGT: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the single country of the emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only recorded with countersight.
Does this make from the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is the question of the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the whole theme of racism in Italy and of the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after clapping a package of cookies.
The case reflects what the Times calls "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and work opportunities" exist, yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by Lega against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement, which also underlines the Pope and the President of the State, "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope to cooperate between Church and State to combat racism at a meeting on the Quirinal."
Students victims of the high rental prices of up to 900 euro per room
The market for apartments for students does not know any crises.
According to the last study of the Sunia, the tenant work, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"These phenomena have already taken very serious trains.The entire number of students loses their right to study, since their families are not able to support them at this level" – says Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities the great demand of the students leads to a deformation of the market that also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, without rental price limits, unauthorized undermines.
For the Sunia there is the need for exceptional measures that lead to lower rental prices by revision of taxation.
When considering the investigation, it is found that a sleeping area in Milan is needed in the Brianza quarter of around 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 Euros (in the district of Nere) and ends with 800 Euros in the district of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 Euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence a sleeping area costs on average 350/400 euros, one room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the quarters around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the quarters around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
Little deeper are the rents in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Eastern and Cinecittà.
Only those in the outer district can save money: 300 Euro for a sleeping place and 450 Euro for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quartets.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Voero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, one single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to foreign students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent of 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historical cinemas are closed due to the beneficiary multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the great multisale complex in the periphery, in the long term means death for the insaal kino in the center. A process that appears not only inevitable and irreversible, but also the goals of a cultural crime.
Most of the historical places of memories are affected, "it is like losing a friend with which you have put down a piece of road full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which brought him in 20 years ago the Oskar and the great price of Cannes. It is the history of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well lost cinema world.
The figures that the Anec, the central commercial association, delivers, speak a clear language: over the last five years, the huge amount of 316 traditional cinemas have to be closed; for the most part, these cinemas paid the cinemas in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardei with 41.
This proves that the main guilt are the multiplexkinos, because it is just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 over the last 5 years, Lombardei has the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "that it is useful that new structures also arise, but in the first place the receipt of the already existing, because a hall in the city is closed, not all its standard customers are ready to look at a multiplexcin in the periphery instead of the old.
And here is still the lack of food for the founding of the commercial association out of sight: the debt charge recorded by the State is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame of the ethical-moral view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be necessary."
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to fears about the old cinemas, has decided to protect them by an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy that aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical center and in the periphery.
The proposed measures include tax advantages for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in connection with transport: it will be allowed to drive to the centre's bordered areas and park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a delightful initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also create new concepts.
However, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, as the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to build the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had played with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; when I crossed the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to avoid seeing the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Piromalli group of Mafia.
The accusations of the lawyer of the Antimafia Authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his alternate of Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who was arrested in Mafia business this morning, are major.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and its nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clans, had already been sentenced to a compensation amount of 10 million euros for the processing in criminal associations of the Mafia.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard disregarding," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
"The Mafia Group was therefore made it possible – the judges – to enter the Council's houses on the official way and to vote in the public administration's policies."
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not mean that in its region it is "all other than an exception to encounter connections between local administrations and organised crimes." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white west."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police of Clan Piromalli, was defeated.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but in 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – the local politicians of their municipal offices had been dismissed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected the head of the middle-right coalition after the election of May 2006.
He screamed Skandal as the prefecture ordered the resolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in the Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of finding everything for political-strategic reasons. The judges, however, explain in connection with the warranty of this morning, that the Piromalli clan even dared to request an amendment to the A3 project.
From a hearing action related to the investigations on the Dal Torrione case, the willingness has been shown to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – which made the public administration's actions identical to the interests of this clans."
When the energy emerges from the waves, suddenly the big ones start
It is a non-destructive source of money, which covers more than 70% of the planet's surface, and only now this seems to understand the great energy companies in the world.
Waves, flows and tides are the new renewable energy sources that now all look, and also seek to okup, such as gigants as chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years, and these studies have not randomly intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
As the price of oil broke up around 1980, the idea of marine energy was forgotten, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pressing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy demand could be covered by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to the double of the current energy produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the flows and tides were still coming.
Gigants in the attack.
The first company, which now puts on marine energy, is Enersis, who signed a contract for the establishment of a power plant in the north of Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are more and more companies from the traditional energy industry who are putting on marine energy production.
"Chevron examines these technologies" – the spokesperson of a company known to the U.S. Gigant in the Wall Street Journal – and considers the possibility of working with us."
This concerns the procurement of an authorisation from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that is not to be underestimated, e.g. if one considers that oil is still being promoted by the US, and President Bush has recently launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the company Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which invests in the new industry, are also not known as the details, so observers speak of an increasing interest.
Enhanceable technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in the breach, which is not least because the last doubts of environmental protectors have not yet been clarified.
To date, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimension and do not seem to cause serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy in a large scale, technologies are required with a much greater impact on the environment.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected Bojen.
The shaft of the waves, which moves the bows up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimming pool via collars and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which, in turn, operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four plans of this type, which are only waiting for state approval, and some of the energy gained could also serve for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a warehouse and a park latze using underseas turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines that feed the generator through the resulting rotary movement.
According to Verdant, a long snake of potential clients has already been waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
A particular interest, according to the Institute for Electriculture Research, is immediately worthy of the potential in the tides.
Even though it is an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind flows, sun radiation and waves, and therefore a more reliable power source.
Especially the tide energy is which states such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states have caused to invest 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
