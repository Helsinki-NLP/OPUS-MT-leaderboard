I'm #PRS_ORG# Grandma and so it's not a problem for me.
Need only a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so that it can be trampled by you as a return.
I ordered #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today she costs 179€.
I really think that's very angry.
Should I cancel and order the order for the better price or is there another possibility of credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be devoted to taking a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the young.
Let's look a little bit, help a little bit, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be a child for themselves, I can't see a problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it's okay for him, it's good.
You're best able to determine whether this fits for your children.
It's not like he's gonna turn K2 and accompany it for hours when he sleeps.
Just legally it is probably questionable.
So maybe the statement of the psychologist is also coming.
For if actually something should happen like a fire, collapse, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to enter is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a criminal / triller a few years ago, and although I can remember almost all the action, the title partout no longer wants to take me in here maybe someone decides...
The story dealt with fear and therapy.
At the beginning of history, an animal carer commits suicide by surging himself with feed and going to his robbery.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation of his therapists, is arranged to operate a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a small niece that also has anxiety (for fire) and lands at this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is entrusted anonymously before every suicide to go to the place of the suicide and document and put the photos into the Internet.
In any event, this therapist finally shows that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is planted a chip that suppresses anxiety center in the brain and ultimately put patients in the most extreme way their fear.
(a woman jumps out of the window another is going to die with intention)
This fear is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the gross act I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can betray me the title of the book I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the password for Wlan.
Just need to contact my husband.
But that can take time.
What steps do I have to do after that?
Is it also possible to withdraw the price difference?
Child, 4 j., splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years, has over the entire length of wooden splitters under the thumbnail (outside).
Have tried to pull him with a pine plate.
Very hard to grab.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow's going to the doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to push up refresh vaccination
Always new omicron cases are getting politics and science in the UK.
Therefore, until New Year, all qualified adults in England are to receive an vaccination offer.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move even faster in the Corona vaccination of vigilance in the face of rapidly rising Omicron numbers than it is to date.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose until the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
The target date was to date at the end of January.
The British Government will also provide support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One faces an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why vaccination protection must be increased urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection could be increased with a third dose of vaccination.
"Let yourself be mad!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in Great Britain, with the total number increased to 3137.
Compared to the day before, this was an increase by 65%.
is the full amount reimbursed from the purchase price at collection?
I am convinced that everyone imagines with pronoms
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not a "peter", but a more complicated name.
I picked him up and depending on where he/she has a cultural background here, it's either a man or a woman.
**I don't know how to write the email now.
Can anybody help me?
** I am foreigners and don't want to stop officials.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine with pronoms.
Got a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them.
Only that one I've bought today is not going to
Obviously, the chair had an unseen lack of sales.
How can such a pollen damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Only try on #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working since ca.
No longer 14 days.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG#, but I wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are again available and I would like to add 2 chairs to the order and invoke it to me.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content warning: I will write something detailed here about domestic violence.
I just have to write something about the soul.
For professional reasons, I (21) get more frequent contact with the victims (and offenders) of domestic violence.
A topic that really naked to me and, unfortunately, it is too common that many victims do not let themselves help or think we couldn't help them.
I'm quite clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation with four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range I can't reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's anxiety to fear revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fearing to withdraw the children from this.
Whatever I want to make everyone clear, partly even very close to the tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
I often wish I could help with it in any case... I know I can't.
But this never makes it easier.
Please, always remember, you're worth living without violence, that's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the series about "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debakel of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster John Patrick was abandoned.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
In front of the game, Ludwigsburg’s coach John Patrick had said with a look back to the Pokal deposit at the Hacro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October: "We have a little wrath in the abdomen."
But it did not lie after the game - but increased again in the light of the 61:72 (28:38) - lower position in the Basketball Bundesliga.
More than the naked result was disappointed by the way in which the performance occurs.
Deputy is called a statistics that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-year quote was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all of the young John Patrick) at say and write 31 trials - more questions?
The answer was John Patrick: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife and did not implement what we trained."
It's the ball to move.
Another thing was his counterpart about Sebastian Gleim: "To win a game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
On Saturday in the Hohenlohe-Arena, only 750 visitors were allowed, but they came at their expense.
Not least also because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, which marked 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team, even the performance carriers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already put back 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon came on twelve points.
Fortunately, a lot of time to haven't stayed.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giant is receiving the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have another addresses, but I changed them.
Yeah, I've been reporting a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all guarantee claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed again and have written them again.
We originally reported ourselves half a year ago.
As poured out of the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He can enthusiasticize his audience with new interpretations of strokes from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on his way with the program "Good day, lovely luck" - if he can happen.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there's nothing about it.
The planned concert was moved in May 2022 - "on administrative instruction" to embrace the Corona virus.
Other of the events planned in the Advent time must also be seen once, as it is on the website of the singer, who becomes 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists then want to retrieve their dates that have already been postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has already sang much and enjoyed singing as a youth.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, in 1986 he founded the Palace of Orchestra with Kommilitons.
Since then, the bariton has established its repertoire of strokes and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded a lot with prices.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of the charts, just like his success album "For women, this is no problem" (2013).
He made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair chopped back and thought on labels, Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music landscape is no longer to think out.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by disability
The new Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has expressed itself against the defiance of large housing companies, as it was requested in Berlin in a referendum.
"With a disapproval, no new apartment is created, it only changes the owner structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sonday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent remains affordable in the next few years.
By the way, a bubble mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition from SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission, how to deal with the outcome of the national decision.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not exclude discussions with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further enhancements in the rental law.
The coalition contract provides a rental price brake up to 2029, a limitation of tenants increases in tenant housing markets and the expansion of the rental level.
I'm going to talk to the Minister of Justice to implement it as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 dead by Tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornados have been drawn through the US.
Only in Kentucky could be more than 100 dead to be complained.
The pictures from there remember a war zone.
In the night on Saturday, several tornados in the U.S. have set up severe destructions and may require up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave about 320 kilometres of desolation, especially in the Member State of Kentucky.
After a visit to the disaster area, the governor Andy Beshear said that wherever the Tornado was pierced, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He expects only in the Member State of Kentucky, with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rise hourly.
Hello, I've just seen that she's sold out Vitrine #NAME#.

If the delivery cannot be made in my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand, just can I order the ceiling now and deliver it to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned a Artike via the contact form or gave up a return and wanted to ask if this was arrived or processed, since I had not received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for an vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees for vaccination premiums.
They are therefore on a line with the ÖGB and Economic Chamber of Socialists, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising logans to vaccination - according to German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to corona implications.

Assistance at first own campaign
Boron to the barbecue!
I just lead for a group of 4 friends the adventure About the grip pass and wants to lead my hero seamlessly into a special campaign written for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the evil weights and their motivations written, the individual records devised, and now I am writing the entrance adventure and stolper already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a flock of grain from Gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran Sea.
There the further action is to develop.
Some miles from the village are supposed to lead the hero up a group of Goblin's and lure them into a backhold.
I would like to give the players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognising the danger early, which also affects the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bowls and seals
If not, the Goblin's runs up the hero in a hollow path and flanks to three left and right-hand bows me arms the flock, while two with spears stop the flock.
If it comes to the fight and the hero are subject, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are found and healed by the son of the village school, a half elevator.
Of course, the car is gone.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable just this half elevator with two of his servants, and come to help the hero in the battle.
The cars are still here, all right.
How fitting do you hold Deus ex Machina from solution 2?
Is the encounter as an entry into the adventure too much?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I hadn't expected so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I'll guarantee many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I've built the lamp out again.
And put it together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I would like to send her back anyway.
Then if you can let the backlights come, I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am generated by Sky Sport F1
Hi, dear F1-Fans, over the season, the quality on German sky has increased, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was canceled to start the F1 pre-reporting timely.
Although the delayed start and the initial accident of the timetable was far behind the planning, the last (planned) ten minutes and the mastership decision (!) could still have been shown.
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 has priority and therefore needs to limit everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Even so stupid, since Sky UK sent the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Schwarzyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then, in the F1, there was a regular insight with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that the tyres may be changed under a red flag.
Although there was this situation in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both of them only came to the conclusion that stepping can change the tyres when there were corresponding radio claims on this topic to Hamilton.
With Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for stepping.
I think that such basic rules should be known simply if you comment on the F1 on a pay-TV sender.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both have constant uncertainties in the matter of rules.
Generally, not like the artistic comment style of Roos, but admit that the taste is a matter.
But there I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
There are constant nausea, which both simply let unprofessionally work, such as ordering coffee at the (even unfamiliar) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a lot of distress into the comment that he seems to not take it seriously.
Not least, the advertisement simply takes over hand at Sky, in the runway Sky is the only broadcaster who goes to the advertising, as you can listen to F1TV because only the German sound track without comment has to come out right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as free TV channels.
Although you have to praise glock and tree gardeners for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very short and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the poorest German-speaking channel that transmits the F1.
Unironic makes RTL to the advertising a better job at the four races they are still allowed to transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendellight, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I've been contacting the chat twice and not yet.
The First Lady told me it was sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has shown a defect after a relatively short time (the substance has a hole on the front of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent to provide an aquarium additionally with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole plants with it.
If you have a large aquarium, you will have pumps with 2 or more outputs so that you can connect more flowers.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model ventilator pump, but also offer to put an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure trump, shell or similar.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The ventilator pump is connected to an Auströmer o.a. by means of an air hose 4/6 mm...and it can go away.
The ventilator pump should be equal or higher than the water level and be administered outside.
If the fan pump is deeper than the water level, you should put a relapse valve between it.
Just cut through the air hose and put the valve between it.
This would prevent if once water would run back that the water runs out of the pool through the pump...
If the ventilator pump is placed in the outdoor, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily, and the packets are also picked up daily here.
It's all right on the road, it's gonna be very fast.
We just want to avoid a little, so that no one is voted, just because it lasted a little longer.
It would be like, not everyone understands all the employees who work in the supply sector too... of course, no corona does.
Please don't evaluate the same badness, just because the delivery is delayed, that's exclusively due to the package services.
Of course, you like to be shaken about these services, even if we say at the moment... they've got it fucking heavy.
This is also very different regionally.
If no one is evil, stay healthy and we all hope that there are better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can you order the legs in hell too?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut subsidiary and moderator to the worldall
The daughter of the first American in the world, a TV engineer and four other passengers have made a short trip into the space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the Blue Origin company of Amazon-founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the United States of Texas.
Under radiant blue sky, Bezo's most personally took the freshly tanted astronauts after their return.
"Will come back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were travelling ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of 1961 as a Nasa astronaut in the Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV engineer Michael Strahan were honour guests of the company who paid four passengers for their tickets: Space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
As much as they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after a short flight.
He had to work hard in his efforts and do everything himself.
She was just like that, said the 74-year-old with a laughter.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He'd liked to return to the All once again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers of height
The "New Shepard" missile system is largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with gravity before the reusable object was burned off from large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres above the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third mandatory all-out of Blue Origin: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old U.S. pilot and a 18-year-old Dutch country.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Criticians suggest Bezos and Blue Origin to drive business with space tourism largely without scientific interest in the welfare of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemia or has studied biochemia
I'm currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and actually find the subject quite exciting and even in the laboratory I'm not disturbed (has already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, before studying, I also thought about professional prospects at the time that I would like to study and become until the promotion.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, particularly impressing the prospects of work.
On the one hand (study check etc) you hear great occupational opportunities and the job is totally searched, on the other hand you hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I would really be interested:
1) What are you currently working?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do this all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really insecure and consider 2022 to break off the study and to make a training as a specialist informatist.
If you have experiences, they also like to write times :)
Extra Stress Before Holidays & Holiday Weekends
This topic came to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only a pocket.
Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
As it seems, it's the day before holidays plus bridge days.
It was so: last week, Mariä Himmelfahrt, which is called "rising" at us in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week it was a long four-day-weeking in the house.
So what was going last week?
Stress all over.
Lauter e-mails that needed to get out of front of ascension, order here, all *unconditioned* before the long weekend.
Because... because?
Because "nearest week" sounds after so much time and that can't be?
Or because people want to pay all serious things in a shorter week as much as in a normal?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday then, but also was powerfully nervous.
What is this self - spiriting about holidays?
What do we have to do with holidays if we are not allowed to give them right?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so independently on it.
My question is simple: Are we just like that, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical kind?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) looks forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, you can simply drive to Ilmenau into the Thüringer Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree on the festival by baking and basting with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the psychic days, however, she has to do something: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to get rid of now."
NECTON-Bio supports a smooth process of mouses and feather reformation.
NECTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of feather damage occurring in birdkeeping are exclusively due to nutrition failure.
Since the feather consists of protein-containing substance, the bird’s specially rich and balanced protein nutrition is a prerequisite for the formation of an easy-to-use feather cloth.
For a working metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occur during the mouse are based on lack of protein or unbalanced supply and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON-Bio, the unfavourable proportion of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NECTON-Bio.
NECTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be administered easily via drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you, I found it.

DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locust was in use in Schlesien and Central Germany, the very rare locust is probably derived from the reconstruction proposal of the model iron trainer ME Heft 11/1968, used with game tracks and miscellaneous parts see photos, function good, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electrocomomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal gants in the Spanish network, may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Sale) and we operated
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG in 1924 to present proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200 tons of coal and 530 tons of passenger trains with 45 km/h travel speed.
As a maximum speed, 65 km/h were required.
Thus, in March 1926 the DRG defined the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' Locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the supply of the mechanical component, the Siemens scooter plant with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives received the E 95 01–06 operating numbers was made.
All survived World War II and then found themselves back on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives came to the Soviet Union as a repair property.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Dessau Reichsbahnenverbesserungswerk, the rehabilitation of all six locomotives was established.
[4] When progressive reelectrification of the Central German network showed a growing need for locomotives for the heavy freight service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed in 1959, while the other machines served as a spare parts donor.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 were preferred in larger numbers.
Only when the E 94 saw that the number of work could not be further increased, the E 95 came to the point of the workout.
[4] The locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to Halle P.
They were used in their own circulation plan mostly before coal trains from the Geisel Valley towards Hall, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematicly, with increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be.
Thus, it often happened that shooters were sticking in circuits.
Then, on this locomotive, the constantly enthusiastic beeman with hammer and wooden bowl had to re-solve the shooter during the ride.
Damage to the motors often occurred and led to monate long eradications in the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s enough new construction locomotives were available and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at that time, the emerging line could be disposed of on old locomotives and the majority of splitter holes, so that the E 95 were dismantled.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn only wanted to put electric locomotives in a single manner, which had resulted in a problem in the train operation due to the difficulties mentioned with the machines and the views of the leadership.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were postponed in mid-1969, they followed the E 95 01, which quit the service on October 5, 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
All locomotives were demolished until the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a Weichenheizanlage on the main train station Halle.
It took some time to convince the responsible people at the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was worth a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the outer work of the locomotive began to present it to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then she was part of the Dresden Transport Museum as non-operable museum locomotives.
In 1986, the interior completion of the locomotives took place.
In the DB Museum Hall (sales) the locomotive is provided with museums.
Since 1995, Bw Halle P has been working on the working work of the locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotives could be presented for the first time as an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and external lacquering, with the transformers being checked and five drivers are capable of operation.
- The locomotives were in use by 1945 on the Schlesian Mountain Railway and the declining subways, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945 the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main area of use was first Schlesien

Residence fire with two light-injured and high damage
Two people have easily been injured in a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage occurred in the six-digit euro area, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire was probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were sent to the hospital on Sunday with light smoking poisoning.
The exact cause of fire was not at first known, but the police did not deliberately burn.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it's coming much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To develop Fake-News - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Çahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Biontech Chief Uğur Çahin had not been publicly expressed as his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo that shows his Corona Impact.
The illness of a friend moved him to this, Çahin informed.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Çahin, published a photo that shows how to receive an vaccination against the Corona virus.
In the social media, there was wrong information that I wasn't supposedly vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of BiontechPfizer vaccine," wrote Çahin on Friday in a contribution on the "LinkedIn" network.
"Since a few months, friends have forced me to post a photo of me, on which I am vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he refused that because communication should not turn around himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply sorrowed when I learned that an old school friend from me was currently fighting for his life.
He fights against a severe covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not imprisoned, Çahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most frequent cause, however, seems to be anxiety, often caused by misinformation and distrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experience.
On the Internet, an interview with the German wave, in which Uğur Çahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was developed in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not allowed to obtain the vaccine myself," said Çahin at that time.
In Germany, there is a priority in vaccination of the vaczine.
In the meantime, priority has been lifted long - and the Biontech chef has been impaired three times according to appropriate information.
Fire in circulation plant: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had a circular station lammed.
After a fire with severe damage in a circulation station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg cruise in North Rhine-Westphalia have to come out for about 24 hours without electricity.
The fire left the lights in several municipalities with 41,000 people affected on Friday evening.
The West Network provider reported that on Saturday there were numerous power aggregates in operation until the large-scale disturbance could be completely remedyed late evening.
Firemen and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care sites in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked the persons concerned for their patience and the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
We also thank the municipalities, the circle, the firearms and the THW for the unfortunate use," said the head of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take into account a few days, since the West Network moneurs had only been able to use some lines for the first time, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company information.
Power flows again
The fire broke out on Friday at 19.15 p.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10,000 volt scalt system in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid Surrounding Station.
Extensive cleaning and repair work are necessary there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt-spacing level was created.
With the help of this adaptation, the power supply will be restored.
Since Saturday, 18 o'clock, over 2,000 people have had electricity again in Much and Ruppichteroth.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually assigned from 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 a.m., the last ones still had electricity affected from the failure.
More than 80 Monteures of West Network and partner companies were in use.
After building an emergency supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that the citizens take care of older or single people in their neighborhood and tell the local firearms houses when there is a need for help," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the construction and operation of emergency power aggregates, the residents of Oldenheims were focusing on it.
Furthermore, according to the authorities, temporary care places in schools have been established for those who have not been able to provide themselves or who need the power-dependent medical devices or who need medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euro?
It is the day deck #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a beautiful day and please stay healthy
But I can't assemble it on the tableboard.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of that.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I cannot put it together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me?
Otherwise I would have to send them back because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased with a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then we'll do it.
Do you send me the return ticket by mail?
the repair is now completed.
I had tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I'm almost ashamed of such a low credit.
We do not agree with this.
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combinations Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have been printed on the podest at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.

Retour of order number #NUMBER#
When is the money transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have made both of them new and use the version 4.5...
Maybe they have already heard of problems in many cases.
Got directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it seems to be on it too.
Sobal I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be incorrectly reporting to the customer service.
As far as I can recognize it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in the meantime.
To ensure that the colour order becomes equal and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, wash and dry with clear water.
Before bringing the brush the first time with a new color to the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 stripes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly along the line.
Light overlap of the color layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid swiftly swiveling with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden sun.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could look through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colours come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to stunning metal slides when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them.
Originally faithful appearance reaches the models through the decals or detract images.
From high-quality signs on airplanes, through boat names, to drawer bars and marks at car models: The Decals give the model the last sleeve.
Put the decals in the right order as long as the components can still be reached well.
A plane cockpit can or may be easier to clothe before it is installed in the romp.
Even more important than the right tool, such as scissors, pinstones and toothtokers, are time, patience and a calm hand when cling.
Cut each required decal and put it up to you.
Decals are also called watersliding images, because you are humiding their backs shortly with water until the carrying paper is darkened through the wets.
Then you just slew the picture a small piece of paper and put the piece on the corresponding position on the model (which you have also flyed before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the wear paper side by side.
Attention: Always check if the image is sitting right before you move it completely from the paper so that it doesn't stick to the finger, knitter or even zip.
Sucking oversupply water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book shortly as soon as I look at something else then I don't read the book anymore and I need to log out and log in and reload the book and search the place to where I read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 single packages
Thank you very much.
Then I'll buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
But do I get that back without problems?
Children's wish treatment in PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together.
We were in child quest treatment for some time now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it is suddenly quenching.
The row after:
We had requested the child winning in advance at the PKV and received the commitment over 3 trials.
The trials have not been restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was counted with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (successless) trials, but they did not yet count on the PKV.
We once again requested the cost acquisition at the PKV and received 3 further attempts.
Following some further attempts (we have made more attempts than agreed, logically expect the most expensive with the PKV) we entered the invoices at the PKV and received the evil surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3), the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 trials.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise are lost.
The second child's wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to Terms and Conditions, "The insurance case begins with healing, it ends when treatment is no longer necessary."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 trials are refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Should the PKV have to point out in the commitments that the further trials occurred with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (conditioned by closed egg ladders) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by e-mail and tell me how to make them the best
All right.
We won't order anything with them anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they obviously have lost good customer.
They'll be happy to pass that on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was triggered and now tell me I have to send back the thing.
I'm sure I can't do anything for the cocktail gets completely disturbed with me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear and clear that the repayment has been triggered and I have still not received a refund by #PRS_ORG#
You can justify their manager that they have now lost two tribal customers.
My friend has also ordered several furniture for our apartment via his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
A office chair must keep a normal use.
Otherwise they can't sell him as an office chair.
In any event, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, I'm not able to create another type of packaging.
I will cut off the cabinet and be able to make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be applied with additional hockers, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget movies
What a low-budget film is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has to say:
>A **low budget film** or **low budget film** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the network you can find rich lists of low-budget movies, such as zB on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's the matter with you?
And what do you think you don't like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, already have 2 apartments completely furnished with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey Ledersofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it also reliable?
Thank you.
With friendly greetings
There's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes to the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Halfer Sieg" against Belarus linked to high costs for the EU
The EU can, in conflict with the Belarusian regime, proclaim a "half victory" to the politician Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
After all, the EU has not solved the confrontation, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP).
This state of silence - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels as a winner - is probably going on for a while.
The relationship with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
It seems that there is an "increasing normalisation of Pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decisively oppose it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It is evident that it cannot take place when a Member State is headed to make its thing," as currently Poland, which does not even allow access to the border to the EU border protection agency Frontex.
In addition, the EU pays another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, Bossong said that a principle agreement on asylum policy is difficult because the line "Great protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Retry of the cross-border
According to Poland’s border protection, migrants have attempted to reach Polish territory across Belarus again.
55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokesman of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials were struck by the migrants on stones at the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was faced and had to be cared for by a military physician.
Overall, border protection registered 52 attempted crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border locks.
Thousands of countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months or have tried to.
The EU suggests Alexander Lukaschenko as a power officer in Minsk to have attracted them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania stated that press reports collapsed border sections.
The EU sank Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to stop traveling there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the scale and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard ban days and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also needs to take into account internal policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not observing that the security device regularly slid thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula-1 Final
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula 1 finale, Mercedes claimed.
The silver pills suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety-car phase when he is supposed to have repeated.
A second objection was filed against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes view, the protocol was not regularly followed.
In the last round of Lewis Hamilton, Verstappen had been frozen in the Mercedes and was frozen to his first formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre was taken shortly after the end of a safety-car phase in which the Dutch had conquered driving cars before him.
I'm checking this.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again.
Thanks for the support

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
In the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read in the Blue Note sold out on Friday from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitive to the nightly sounds at her door.
I gave up yesterday the contact form for returning an article but received no e-mail confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my question was entered.
It hasn't everyone's time for your clopped chat and wrongly delivered billets from China.
Your mistake you fix and not all out of our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had appreciated yesterday and agreed that I or Ms. #NAME# receive an e-mail with a 60 euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# night table and a return label.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-semit, it doesn't mean anything.
That's as if an abdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
I don't give it to them both.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distant yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yeah, well, then you're just as little serious as Kollegah.
Whoever seriously questions evolution is simply completely lost.
That's why a God has launched the whole thing.
But as soon as you are creative, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is only insane.
And with that you are a scientist and not to take any more seriously, like Kollegah.
In order to get an optimal view field, the magnification should be close to the eye as close as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the lupe to the edge zone practically forgiving and colourless.
Lupes are often marked with magnification details.
However, this information applies only to precise conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your lupe optimally, we ask you to note the indications in the table "Technical Data" (See instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices – also in the case of lupes – light reflections.
By an antireflex layer, these reflections are significantly reduced.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (in German and English).

Tanning sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curiosis situations when selling tonnes.
One time, a man even without his partner was supposed to have gone home because both couldn't agree.
Every year he plants well 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curiosis situation.
That always makes the pre-devotion night a bit funny, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I have received a broken delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I'm going to evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to talk about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spider.
And therefore both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be as much as the "dreher", which doesn't sound so delicious at all.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber closure in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have now problems building a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit until a few accidents.
The new fibre closure sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also arrives.
However, at the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, no longer reach the full 500, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less comes (e.g. use a plug-in which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fibre closure is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which seems to use a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than DLan, there were similar major losses here too.
Could anyone explain to me why with glass fiber so much Internet speed goes "lost" over the power line?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely difficult to put LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, so I've created an account here extra.
That is why I would be more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to switch the giro account
Anyone who thought it was the first time to be quiet with the girokonts, looks foolish.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm their customers' fees increases in the past with all sorts of tricks, the free amounts for negative interest rates continue to fall.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered to be relatively generous with a limit of EUR 100.000.
Now she just halfed the free amount and even celebrated for the day's money.
In a first step, the border was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 Euros for Giro and Investment Accounts and to 25,000 Euros for Day Money Accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with stock customers".
The Commerzbank had already dropped to a border of EUR 50,000, which still applies, as well as to the ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, currently popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less according to numbers of the Internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at EUR 25,000: however, there is still a legal conflict with consumer centres that have even been righted against this regulation in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin.
The banks are already discussing whether the institutions should make provision - in case the upper instances also explain the negative interest rates in principle for inadmissible and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.
The table was delivered for 8 people instead of those for 6 people.
The lower is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at Hollywood's top.
But their lives are like mountains and valleys.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who made Furore in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continued series of "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers cares about their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, they give themselves a chip on the day (yes, read correctly: a single chip from the bag).
That you still flee to the hearts of the female and male fans in the same way is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has pech with luck - and still looks for the great love.
And the baby's quest removed from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she now becomes mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Stay hoping that also make success and glory happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was still less than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled out the gloves and wise the sweat from the forehead.
That's it.
After a riding error and a light band contact, the renown had to postpone his Alfa Romeo at the Great Price of Abu Dhabi after not even half of the racedistance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children were also traveling to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was the profit of the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He created 21 Grand Prix victory, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich holt 60. World Cup victory - Nolte victories in the Twoerbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björndale with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I thought this once, I had to win nine and a half per season, then I could create it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympiager from the BSC Oberbeburg, who booked two successes in two days at the Winterberg race.
Only on Saturday he refused the attack of Johannes Lochner at five hundredths, in which he ran from rank three to one.
Then he changed something about the material setting and went out a larger jump on Sunday at 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbeerburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he went in front of the British Brad Hall.
==References====External links==
"We have gone greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22th victory in series.
The Berchtesgaden Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came to place two times before this time at Range five.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in the first race at the place of eight.
"If I knew what he did differently, I would do it like that," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte took the third season victory on her homeway.
On the day before it was only for the fourth place in the Monobob, she cracked on Sunday at the German Triple success with Deborah Levi to the world cup victory.
Mariama Jamanka of BRC Thuringia, two olympialists from BRC, came to rank with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic Qualification, she booked the first podest place in this winter.
Kim Kalicki, Wiesbadener, landed with Leonie Fiebig on place three.
For me it was supercool, first podest place in the world cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama's taking me.
I'm superb with the development.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times were okay today," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just moving, but there's also enormous much to do."
Jamanka annoyed a little about the not quite fault-free rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I had the blanket already in the cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get him and therefore I couldn't make it so I finally asked.
By Corona last year I had quite different problems and never time for it.
And now he said it was expired what was very angry with me.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seating bank.
I would like to give it back and order it again because it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipping only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No until I get on tippe an extra field with the message
Was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered beard.
But we want the regal module anyway, just a new uninjured
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, only until XY...
Hello dear girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write, and maybe the one or others are...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog emama - except that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, a burning 2. degree has taken on Monday and has been depressive for years (but now in therapy).
Yesterday, I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel, we have a lot shaken and it was nice.
I helped him to shower (because hand is in the band wg burning).
He is cooled up above and we are currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me feel very much to cope with my needs for affection and love.
My dog's kid just got buckweh, I cooked for him, and now he's lying in his cock and has relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and strangle for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and it's just a month away.
Now we will also have homework, which we will of course divide.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is very well maintained, I am halfways well therapied and right.
Not good, but I'm right and almost symptom-free.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h, I have a written test for which I haven't yet done and over-morrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I'll have a oral trial on Tuesday, and then what's coming in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space anymore.
So my week goes like this: only until over morning, then it's weekend.
But after that, is this all going on?
Just until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Just to the weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'm packing that ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I don't...
Is that what you're doing?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely thankful, I can't put that in words at all.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs elsewhere.
I think that also has some of the things to do with Mental Load of Women, and that's why I thought I'd surely find people here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today, unfortunately, the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
In the first delivery, the colour was exactly as on the website.
We're very disappointed!!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to exchange the table now, I get another color or how?
The mail for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
For the rest two times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
At that time, I found that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them, such as mathematics or Earth science.
It was always a strange thing for me, perhaps because I was raised Christianly and I always believed somehow.
What are you doing?
You may also be able to tell about working and study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate.
Is there also a curriculum, etc.
But simply find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the relativity theory.
If you don't believe it, what then brings you to teach religion?
True culture or something?
Hope you're not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Write like English I understand that well
That's a very long time, then I'd disregard it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a feedback by the beginning of the next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Search for movies Please help
Hello, dear people.
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (in 24).
I think it's been a movie for adolescents.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
First of all, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths are crossing and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live myself, I mean.
The transition is also believed to be the tomb of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers fight against each other.
If you say something I'm grateful for any answer.
Our little one just slept on the stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
That's how a child keeps much more than you think.
Make sure everything's right over there, no cupboards, often going in and watching, but not a minute of monitoring.
That makes you mad!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and we had no sleeping bag, but always a ceiling.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it get up from the abdomen?
Or is it with the face ahead right in the mattress?
That's what you can do. It's all right.
We have also all grown up, and when my husband came to the world, it was for example going and gave the kids to be put on the belly to sleep.
In addition, we are already "Stamming" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I've already written with a colleague from you yesterday and no feedback yet.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I'll ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used at this time.
To say it quite clear.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply so that the policy of this broadcaster is now under all sauce.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a large bedling tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Zitat Arno: You want to be "no running litfoot pillars".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertiser who tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elitefan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don's.
The natural ones apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking of empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms is trying to make ashes.
How can you find this all right?
It's great if you like it, I think it's horrible.
I'm asking for a call, because my delivered wooden table was defected.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so I should still work.
I thought that the net part alone was enough to operate.
Error display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged power.
Then I've grown up the battery, but even here's nothing.
Don't you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network operation?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seating area is....
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 backpack of Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of version also swallow larger photo equipment without problems that can be safely disturbed with the polstered FlexFold participants.
And what else you need on everyday items remains well organized and separately from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2) the series is still present in a new look.
The skillful, minimalist design has it in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that protect the backpack's interiors reliablely and still offer access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: once conventionally via the lid fold, which can be locked with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent thoughtful solution for effective protection, which has already proved itself in the messenger bags.
In this case, there is a closure handle made of metal with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of different "folding stands": there are 4 anchor bars, stablely destroyed, which can be hacked into the shutter.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper.
Lock and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be closed reliablely without delaying the hooks.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack basically from others, photo backpacks: Alongside the lid fold, there is still a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from the top - you don't have to wake through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail enormously increases the daily fitness of the backpack: not only if you take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or baggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the interior (more below) and so both easily stew separately - and access independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side from the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main case, while the everyday things are safely staying in the left backpack and don't come between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable wear straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely produced from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# has left me yesterday an e-mail for confirmation for the commission of
Contact from the supply announced to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
I haven't received a message until now.
I'm asking for immediately finishing.
I already write with the third support staff, nobody else I came beyond the promise that I get an e-mail as a confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
It's gonna look off when the closet could be delivered again?
It's not an option for me to keep him like this...
It works.
Thank you very much for help
Do you want another nice evening?
hallo, my order is #NUMBER#. When is the article delivered?
Order and payment was 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher to me, I will give up a larger order, but I have kept the damaged furniture piece and not sent back.
And that last year I couldn't know that I was going differently than I thought, and I couldn't make it timely and clear.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the claims of the dynamic driver to appreciate reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast and processed mechanically (burdend and cut).
All thin discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical properties, which are owned for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which focuses on the characteristics of the original assembly with the elimination of the disc.
The thin discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
In addition, openings created increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, while the cuttings improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake locks.
Aesthetic properties of our thin discs underline the character of each car by attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event represented the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered in the southern gift of the American River shining bricks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and dissolved the so-called "California Gold Rush" from ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were disposed, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels came almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share in the wealth of the country.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, get horses together and build businesses.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding river runs and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You need to overtake your pioneer colleagues not to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, you need to build budgets with your resources and a tableau that is more and more "working" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules for your benefit.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridges, you can develop your individual style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California acquired official state).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will select a location on the schedule in which they can perform actions.
Afterwards their selection is discovered and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, he gets a lock!
These deactivate the half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then players perform alternating actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolverhelds.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the awarder turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This continues until the awardee has moved five times, so every location has covered once and ends the year.
There is a shooting in which the players must defend Coloma before a attack of anger bandite.
If the players have contributed enough revolts and the bandites are payable, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end at the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player wins with most victories!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychic violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is pleased to see a guest in Talkshows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrannen" (2008) he triggered a severe debate on education.
Former patient: women and teachers now raise serious accusations of him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible ones must never, never, go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for its development and to make the frame for the child as large as it is in the situation as meaningful and possible.
Brerr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise about the failure of the test obligation for three times vaccinated
The Ministers of Health of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a federal failure to test obligations for three times vaccinated persons.
"We countries need rapid clarity, whether and from when for three times vaccinated, the test requirement can be avoided," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Minister Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The loss of 2G plus for three times vaccinated is "not only medically useful, but also provides additional vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed that "he will make a proposal to the Minister for Health in the next Tuesday". − afp
So I want to send the lamp back.
How do I do the best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more about my #PRS_ORG# shopping.
Display: Ups, there was an error.
Purchase via the #PRS_ORG# page goes on the computer.
I've updated account data.
What could this be?
What you describe is a *Awareness*, meaningful perceptions under full narkosis.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing sounds/stimmes, more rare to see pictures and most rare to perceive pain.
Relevant for this topic: Emperor cuts are surgeries that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep narkosis is avoided to protect the child until the renewal.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the narkose interview.
Certain anaesthetics such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, although this comment of me describes Awareness correct, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition no.
Have read their comment wrongly.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ do not help us either.
These are legal guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be that they take the defective chair back.
This is, in addition to the legal obligation, standard in the ecommerce sector.
Please check them again if they take the defective chair back at least.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
That's where we're losing some money.
I sent you a mail you didn't answer.
The question again.
The order and the bill indicates that the product is delivered into a room of my choice.
The specialist is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they were delivering only before the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know a person who can wear the heavy furniture in the first floor.
I'm not gonna call?
I had raised a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97-year-old
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intent.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's still the new book on the table, printed: "An old man gets older."
The shocking diary of a slow departure from the world, which led the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the message comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I've been witnessing my thanks to life here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most frequent are Europelette, common wooden pallets, which are mainly used in the European area as charging carriers.
They are certified by the European Palette Association EPAL
According to statistics in Austria, in 2020 over ten million pallets were produced.
The production value was approximately 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually will not be collected
New York takes the first MLS Championship
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in the regular playtime against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the Elfmeter shooting with 4:2.
In the finale of the Eastern Conference, New York had continued against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Raw Tips & Tricks
I had got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect Gulasch.
That was there for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butter kind!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I came to the taste and want to cook for the first time rouladen.
Tomorrow, I'm gonna put on a bovine fountain for that.
Do you still have any tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but only a big pot.
How's it going?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer so good, but I get that
I'm about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until now, the money hasn't come in with me.
Please check there.
Where there are still Christmas breads in Lübeck's room
For many people, Gans or ducks are among the Christmas days such as the tanning tree and the gifts.
You haven't got a poultry yet?
Now the time is getting short.
We'll tell you where you'll get a Christmas bread in Lübeck's room.
The "drive" of a tube end level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor Continuing.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME regulators, you can set the desired peak and, on the one hand, the cutting content of your sounds.
In addition, VT+ amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator that can reduce the sound level without changing something on the "gain" and the distortion.
The above already sounded that the POWER LEVEL regulator can even fleet a power reserve when it comes to loudly.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL regulators, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphones can also be used as a line output.
This signal is processed with a box simulation so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or direct recording.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX book so you can jamme to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
Those who also donate a VFS5 foot-checker can also easily call the sounds by foot, turn the impact blocks on/off and "lap the speed of the compatible effects".
This is essential for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX goes another step in the future!
But it saw it with others like that.
Is it possible to send the lamp back?
Because it's too low for a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me?
And the cocktail?
Do we get another update for the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it wasn't, I would be satisfied with a deposit or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are a bit much.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know whether screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (Turn) on the intended hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on the renewal of the International Atomic Agreement, Iranian data indicates that progress has been made.
"The two sides are shortly before agreeing on the topics to be held on the agenda," said Iran's chief dealer Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the Irna News Agency.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first, there has not even been agreement on the subjects to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna discussions on the renewal of the agreement were continued after nearly one-week interruption.
Undertakings of Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia take part in the negotiations.
A U.S. delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia conquered Sachsen - Free State now state with highest Corona-Incidency
Thuringia has dissolved Sachsen and is currently showing the highest inzidency across Germany.
The only federal country is the value above the 1000 brand.
As a single federal country, Thuringia was located at the Corona-Inzidenz on Sunday above the 1000 brand.
The Robert Koch Institute announced the seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100.000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always shown the highest inzidency in Germany, this value was 99,5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, new infections with the Sars-CoV-2-virus and 16 more deaths were reported in connection with an infection within one day.
200 severely affected by Covid-19 patients were intensively treated in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are barely afterwards with the collection of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is done only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick on the package and give it to the post, that was it, or?
I don't have to click on/pay up here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a frequent in my eyes.
It's time for changes
###MBundestag I have been greeted, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can find one: it is not extinct.
We have come into a winter bar and have expanded the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this is simply related to dissatisfaction, as some things have expired here and as we are generally present.
In the last days, the impression has increased that many here really still have bock on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the Community is asked about the MBundestag which it wants to live.
The attack came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last days and has found one, just said, screws.
After some, several people have found themselves from the Community who are pleased to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on all to participate in this project, only so can this project have an existence in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How is the MBundestag supposed to work in the future?
* What existing orders must be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we appear outside in the future?
* How should new members be purchased?
* How do we create a fair choice system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but what's not bad, we've got the discord at the end.
If you have pleasure and time, come on the discord, work with and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered you a lamp screen that's still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/kloby for it and not suitable for my taste.
I already ordered a different suspension for that.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day deck #PRS_ORG#, are there also in oversize, i.e. in 240/240, for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty closet will be picked up at a time.
And I'm asking you to make it now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for collection - they must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to agree a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get these and decide to return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She himself has lived for a while vegetarian, at the moment probably eats very rarely meat.
I myself was also a few years ago vegetarian.
On the question whether I always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarism had been a planned intermediate step, I have answered honestly without a lot of thought.
And although I long thought that as a vegetarian, I would support the animal welfare, but at some time I reflected and understood that I finally support animal torture.
That's why I'm going to be vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that came up on her side, she then defended vegetarism and thought she knew where her meat came from and they were reduced as a vegetarian animal grief.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a veganer you are quickly put into a corner and that conflicts will arise without creating it.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not disconnect from the statutory requirements for remote sales.
I am on the assigned date at which #PRS_ORG# my return does not take place.
Since I can't be on the spot because of a funeral, that can't be changed.
Please, an alternative pick-up date can be assigned to me.
From 01.02.#NUMBER#, I have to meet again.
Lahnsteine Wehr for water restoration equipped: 45,000 euros of the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Pfälzische Innenminister Roger Lewentz in the Lahnsteiner Rathaus gave a grant decision of 45,000 euros for the new appliance car Water restoration of the Voluntary Fire Force Lahnstein to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonnet.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rheinland-Pfalz supports us with this," says Lahnstein's Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, you are constantly expecting rising inputs: The tree of hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the loan as a leisure flow contributes to this.
I bought a book I could only read 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, have synchronized, removed, and the app reloaded NOTS has worked.
I'm frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and hopes for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in order?

Thank you for putting the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we were also armor carriers in the executive, I don't want to go on with it!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
But, in principle, one should say that, of course, the minister of State rather comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, that even in the special uniform and weapons wear people on the right of conservative magic should also be aware that these people can hardly deal with the living reality, of course, because you have, of course, in addition to the average white, many Germans with migration backgrounds, women and also homosexuals (and so I don't mean now, the exaggerated feminine cliché swubles, because they are in the executive rather fewer than nothing but quite normal men and women to whom they don't tell them) and even these people can and I have to rely on, because in doubt they will save you your life or put it on you.
However, even if it sounds weird for the first time my experience sounds like a conservative attitude, it is proud of Germany and feels rather less collapsed by exaggerated left-hand policies, even if this policy is supposed to be used for them or if it is right to make them, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, as police and forces of course are also a cross section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly smear any state-threatening plans, medial is completely exaggerated and angry me too.
Of course, police and soldiers who were often in foreign use often start to pause because of negative experiences, and also say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It is also possible that right spiritmates also meet who make a real exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, my opinion is well opposed, and it is also counteracted with political education and education.
Germany is so twisted internationally, and it is also my view that we couldn't afford to have right racists and Nazis in our orders at all!
Yeah, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered it in November.
but it was so confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order that's no longer available.
I've gotten it with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could supply the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black still to Germany or this basket is also available in Germany somewhere.
I always find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the wooden part are two deep candles that have been filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Orderer by child?
Hello, I've been working a thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (in self-employed, very little leisure), but already my lifetime I get it more bad than just to keep my household permanently clean and decent.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and clean.
But it is never so “that somebody could come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband isn't better either, but it's usually going to disturb me somewhere, but it's just losing my household against work and distress.
The kitchen is always cleaned because we like to cook.
Now on my question, have you managed to become more decent with child?
We haven't done anything yet, but we've been working on it and this question's been doing me longer.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't disturb me so stupid as long as no visit comes and, for example, it's always fresh clothes there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger stimulus with a child or you stay slippery?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality and anatomic pre-formed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and allows virtually unlimited freedom of movement.
Preformation with special, further exploration of the joints for improved freedom of movement (in arm and knees)
Focea Comfort 4 was more than doubled in the Flex System 2 area covered by the Flex System to increase the comfort.
Nearless stretch panels on the joints reduce the friction (axis, arm and knees)
High-quality preformations in the lower back range and in the step ensure an enclosed, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the Lendenwirbel area increases the flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves the comfort, especially in the ironing and mounting of the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex zone which is around the shoulders and on the back guarantees increased flexibility in movements of the arms and the back.
Fireskin is a warming, water resistant material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Nearless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face on the hood increases the comfort, sealing and durability (separate cap)
Weak, in the craving zone, improves the sealing with a refinable wheat adjustment by means of a flexible, sparkling closure which does not hold on the casting or the seams
Double-mankets with zipper to arm and foot joints combine a convertible interior canvas with a soft, coated neoprene outer canvas
45° incorporation at the conclusion of the inner cante for increased elasticity and loadability in dressing.
Long zipper on the neck with an elaskin amplification, for an anatomic cut with increased comfort on the overall without haube
Long G-Lock P back zipper (all without haube) with metal sleeve and built-in Water Dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent)
zipper of arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zipper to prevent zipping if excessive force is used.
Neopren panels bundled with external and internal overlap
Edges of the outer canvassed for greater loadability
Edges of interior canvas occupied for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer at its place, especially in the case of deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as a person with self-insured personality disturbance?
I have been training in software development and have now been learning for about a year.
Sadly, however, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right thing for me, why I have been considering it for a long time to start again and study social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecurity (or preventive) personality disturbance (ÄVPS).
This means that I have no feeling of self-evaluation and that I am thus shy.
I have no problem talking to people at a real level, but I find it very difficult to talk and I have been told more often that I work inaccurately (which I believe has already become better).
Can I become so social workers?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or in the open juvenile step, but rather in the advisory or family assistance, for example.
I do not know, however, whether the specific workday is really the way I imagine it is, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it takes me down every time I have something to do with my code ("should get the simplest things up again") and I find it hard to ask for more experienced colleagues to ask for help ("I should really know how this is going"/"I keep him with my stupid questions from work"/"which really needs to consider me to be misinterpreted" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it in the place.
But you've kept the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you think they're giving back?
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message will not be authorized for your #PRS_ORG#
Are there problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein absorbed with the feed (protein) breaks the bird into the individual protein compounds (amino acids) in its stomach-darm tractor and builds its body-own protein materials, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation of nestling and feather rebuilding in the mausering bird are extremely complex processes and associated with a particularly high demand for the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NECTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as otherwise disturbances may occur in the gross run.
Following this curative administration of NECTON-Bio should be reversed to the daily vitamin supply with NECTON-S (Multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NECTON bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare as much drinking water/milk feed as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A stripped measuring spoon (incoming) corresponds to 1 g NECTON-Bio.
In the event of severe feather damage, the double or threefold dose of NECTON bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of feather reformation is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is adjusted until the feather reconstruction is complete.
Storage: NECTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun radiation, between 15° and 25°C.
Please apologize, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months ?
The guarantee claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to tell you that my order has arrived damaged and images have been attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a community employee in the revokation of the statute
Hello r/Journal AdviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is supposed to be liked on our property.
So Fällan bid to the municipality.
One employee writes me that the case of fruit trees and thus the Walnuss is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the Walnuss is explicitly indicated as a protective tree.
Can I rely on the staff's statement or not?
On the one side, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we'll use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a retirement or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that only the question is whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the ceiling to Germany
Can you check that?
Eil notification: Severe traffic accident at Selb
Recently, a severe traffic accident occurred at St 2179 between Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police's press alarm is currently reporting (14:03 o'clock), a car has come to counter-trading.
There's injuries.
I understand.
Well, thank you again that it was so easy!
Council and ideas on further vocational life
For the first time, happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head just crushs everything you can think of.
Before I get out of here now .. shortly: I need advice and best of people who know somehow my situation - that is, of you.
I'm just doing the Ref as a Querrainer.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in one area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't call more precisely here).
But this whole thing was too boring to me and I looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
Sometime I landed at the Teaching Office and was sure that it is - even if the conditions are clearly inflexibler than in my previous profession, but I didn't care about that.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job invitations".
And it's just half a year around.
At the times before, I have always decided to continue and at least to finish the Ref, after that I can still swallow.
But right now I'm absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I've been completely run out.
Now there's vacations, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was my weekend also my weekend and my celebration evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work did not matter at the moments.
Now I'm too stressed by the family celebration.
And then there are these starous structures that nervous me in addition.
Basically, it makes fun and from outside, the Ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely cursed and wondering how much stress my body holds before he's completely close - if he doesn't.
I wonder if I would like to have this the rest of the work life - just if I read some contributions from you here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area where I was appreciated, I could take free time if I needed it, and although the work was somewhat boring, but was adequately paid for it, together in a team that worked and not as a single fighter like this is the most time.
But then I wonder if I haven't arrived at the same place in one year as now and I'm not satisfied.
You realize it's all kinds of tricky, but maybe you've got out as outstanding advice or ideas, how I get out of this situation, which I'm totally finished and that I start to cry about it in the smallest thought.
I'm not gonna make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thanks for reading and apologizing to the waisty underton of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has developed steadily, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" feature, which perfectly reflects the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the latest in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amps, the VTX amplifiers are waiting for with an authenticity which is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage valvetronix tube amplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this cooled switch, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances are just so spraying.
With the "Tone Room" software of VOX you can even correct and prohibit historical facts on the virtual level until the Amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined it.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to satisfy new sound requirements, which has led to a power-shaped VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 – with more dynamics as well as numerous and more decisively improved amplifier models.
From handy VT20+ to VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed in such a way that all guitarists are looking for a maximum sound diversity here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuancated play dynamics and string attack as well as a prompt talk.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers have discovered that the final stage mainly determines the character of a amplifier and developed VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The Valve Reactor-scending of each VT+ amplifier fitted with a 12AX7 tube perfectly eliminates the behaviour, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points by Wagner: Losing Magic at Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner Brewers can shine - however, for the victory against the Los Angeles Clippers it is not enough.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz, Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main issue is also adaptable: with three individual plastering and folding clothing participants, it is oriented according to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any kind of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror cameras.
Finally, what fits in the backpack depends of course on the size of the camera and the objective.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with a positioned lens, two to three alternate objectives and a mount flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can still steal a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras of Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Serie) can use the backpack for his equipment and for photo-friend things.
Drone pilots also meet an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L because the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulcan breakthrough on La Palma: probably longest history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava streams on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic outbreak on La Palma has been the longest in the famous history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
To date, the outbreak of the volcano Tehuya was considered to be the longest on the Atlantic island on the west coast of Africa in 1585.
No reliable data are available about previous eruptions.
The activity of the unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased something in the past days, but volcanologists have continued to dare no forecast when he could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best message is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the State TV channel RTVE.
Injuries in millions
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the eruption, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 housings and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Knapp 1200 hectares were covered by a metre thick lava layer.
This is almost 1700 soccer fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, Lava produced two new landings with a size of about 50 hectares together.
Especially the major banana cultivation for the island was affected, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 people live directly or indirectly, and which was already in the crisis before the volcanic outbreak.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is in front of the door, and especially the children will hardly expect the celebration of heaven.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree are connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crushing tension in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional events that still hold together our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift, so that the gesture of the gift, which after French sociologists and ethnologists Marcel Mauss had been a peace-founding "Gesellschaftsvertrag of Nature Populations", could escape the steady routine and be refilled in the context of this tradition.
How the Christian Child became from Nikolaus
Strictly, it was the Protestants by which Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Previously on Nikolaus Day, gifts were given to some kind.
The background of this still popular moral is that the Holy Nikolaus, as Bishop of Myra, had thrown three women secretly into their window in one night in order to save them another life in sin.
This unconventional kind of gift came from the popular custom in Germany to fill the boots, especially the children, with gifts.
Protestants stumbled in this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and humans as "healthy worship".
For these reasons, they are against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child from Nikolaus and founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the bacon thus swept on the Holy Night.
However, since most Protestants do not see such detail issues so closely, it is only the least annoyed that the custom of Saint Nikolaus is similar to Martin's use with Martinssingen and Martin's conversion is still an integral part of the past night.
Today you will find in boots before the doors and under the Christmas tree from socks to desired luxurious watches all that the heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources have proved a tradition of gift since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nikolaus.
With the reformation, the day of the gift was going on the Holy evening.
However, in all Christian countries, a cheerful cheerful muddle exists on the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region, whether the Christian child appears on the Holy Night or the Christmas man, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, to whom some own species were assigned with the time.
This includes, for example, his white ruce bart, which has little common with the rather stringent assyrbart of the historical figure, his sledge drawn by pensioners and the favor of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nikolaus remains the central figure at the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy there is the Hex Befana, who should have given them the way to Jesus' child.
In Scandinavia, sometimes fabulous creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought fathers' frost to some glory.
Here it is not pensioners, but three horses that draw his sleds as troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for giving the gifts.

Police shoots suspicious bank robbers near the King's Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told the callers that they had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookmaker.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
They had fallen shots and the man had been hit.
He was declared dead in the town of deceased.
The police did not go out of a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other royal family members also live there.
Which one?
No matter where I click, I'll be directed to your side immediately.
The decorative light fits into every beet, garden area or sting species harmoniously.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored with 2 peppers in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lamp duration max. 10 h.
- The robust plastic performance can be used throughout the year in the external area.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from remote galaxies that lend interior color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light is fascinating – optionally in white or coloured light (in six different color tones).
The cantless, amorphic design is consciously chosen: As a naturally shaped large peasant, this modern light object is presented by day.
Its organic rounds fit into every natural environment – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone beet.
He also makes himself well in the neighborhood of larger pedestrians and finders, where he knows himself thanks to his size.
You can save great pre-works: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require any transmission or batteries.
Set the "light stone" to any day of sun shining place.
Two Earth sprays delivered, if necessary, ensure fixed hold.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already loading when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the event of collapse, "Smart Stone" begins to illuminate itself; in which color you choose it yourself: Just six attractive light colors – besides daylight white – are for you to choose.
Also, the disabling is automatically done as soon as the battery load level is reduced to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins from the front the next day.
That's what I've done several times. It doesn't work.
Sadly, I'd like to continue ordering you, but if the voucher isn't counted to me, I won't be ordered in principle anymore.

Pillen Problem
Hello, dear female people,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, after a year, actually my first post is reddit.
To my problem: I started taking the pill about five years ago again, mostly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shake PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to leave this again because I have to take enough medicines through chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had got from 0 to 100 explosion-like pickel at my last about two-year break and they everywhere.
As far as superficial, but I was very stressed, and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe anyone has any tips to avoid this once.
My cosmetics are already free of parfume and without dunes, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, I haven't taken so seriously and Hautarzt's appointment is coming.
Thanks to everyone who has read through the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is so nesome.
Prebupertary had bad Neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-flake squirrels and the acne theme.
I also tried in the course of disease everything I could and remained hanging on no sugar, milk and meat-armed mixing food, because otherwise nothing works so well.
It may also be good that hormonell is simply the worm in there, but if you like me everywhere have a place of construction, you would prefer to stop looking for what else is going wrong.
I had all of her colleague semina o. a.
Written and now I lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concerns.
I always have to work in the meantime and to the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What's there to check if the money was there, I'd have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong
But there is it in general in large
because it is available in black size

110 kV earth cable is rebuilt 2022
The approval for the movement of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legally powerful.
The plan fixing decision of the government of Niederbayern frees the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was now communicating to the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometre long earth cable will combine the Tann circulation in the north of the community and the existing 110 kilovolt direction between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of the release line.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts.
The blue betsell number:#PRS_ORG# with the broadcast number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the note "not possible delivery".
All three other packages have arrived so that a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the other process is now?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget that, I've already explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a co-mode of glass and all sides are placed up, so there is everywhere glass and the cardboard is broken
The commode stands in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to get into the apartment due to the #PRS_ORG# provisions
This means that the cocktail can't be picked up because no one can get in my apartment
Thanks for the message
But why only EUR 20?
The origin value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's for all books, that's why the question to #PRS_ORG# is because it's probably a general problem
Ref: Planning teaching (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in Ref since summer, teaching has been fun, but I have currently have big problems to plan my teaching in the field of Earth.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped so that I can in principle only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can also only copy s/w free of charge (what nerves for exploration).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the theme of geo factors, and with me it is actually every hour for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always go out of the goal of learning (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I have a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
That is why the worksheets are also available.
Well, maybe I can do a physics teacher how to work with the book time-efficient.
I'd be glad.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I really decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to take the return as soon as possible for the first time.
The trade fears Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most shops only who is vaccinated or healed.
The trade considers that this is unnecessary and complains about turnover breaks.
He has a possible solution, too.
The 2G rules, from the viewpoint of the German Trade Association (HDE), ruin the retail trade the important Christmas business.
In the case of transactions with articles of non-day needs, sales breakdowns should be complained, HDE chief business leader Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a current HDE survey of 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already deprecated the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive highlight of the year is often a hole without soil," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost one third of their pre-crisis revenue in the past week.
Well it runs only in food retail and online.
The association demanded consequences from dramatic development.
Purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the main business leader.
"2G when shopping does not bring us further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations scared customers and required high personnel utilization.
It asked that the volume regime should be approved throughout the country.
Afterwards, each customer should only be controlled at 2G (vaccinated or restored) once and would have access to all businesses with the retained volumes on that day.
In addition, in retail trade, as already in public transport, sampling controls should be sufficient in the case of the 3G rules (vaccinated, genesed or tested).
The German Euroshop, specialized in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at approximately 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said Chief of Director Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economy Week".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the center is attempted to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called volume solution, where "for example, visitors can once enter all shops at a central location in the center and then – equipped with a bracelet similar to in a club hotel – uninterruptedly".
I have recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried to be chopped with a yellow filler.
That looks stupid.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it into the package and sticked it back.
How do I have to go on for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
The setting of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp provides a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light produces a very light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flash-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large surfaces at relatively small distances is excellent.
By the way, even in reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the colour temperature.
It is a great tool to work both at the film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in TV studios or when the lamp is mounted on hard-to-access places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of keys and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery range)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply pressing one of the storage keys will be pushed and finished.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that when new switching on, the known situation is restored - very practical when studio work is when the camera is set to certain color temperatures, for example.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality is the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can access existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery teaser that is built in with each of the two batteries a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlamp over the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very easy.
You have a 16mm cavity as a connection to fastening, so you can directly access your phototative.
The inclination shall be reliably adjusted by means of fixers on both sides.
It has been observed that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a cocktail is included in the range of delivery.
Great that is also included in the range of delivery bags.
So you can transport or store the light with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Shame that I have given and she is too small :(
"Party we wanted to taste": Frankfurt celebrates after a great comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series victorious Hesse was supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga Pleite.
But then the SGE turned up, in a good hour, the frustration about an enlarged season start of the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner exclaimed at DAZN and spoke a "Pauschal-Lob, to every one who was with it".
At first, it looked after a new damper for the Frankfurter who was now on rank nine still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the liver kissors with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players returned then and showed a fantastic performance," said Glasner.
I am madly happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Christopher Lenz, who was able to reappear the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overwhelming muscle injury, stressed the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old and was pleased with a look at the result especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to make today.
However, for the coming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself now, but is also well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top version.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now you want to "go step by step and remain modest" and to "do the tasks at this level" until the change of the year.
Next, on Wednesday, during the English week, there is an outward play at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky) on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you because of a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it be redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent to me again directly or do I have to wait until the money has been transferred back and give up the order again?
Sadly, I would say that I will not be ordered again because it has lasted very long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for handball women before quarter finals against Spain
Germany's handball women shaved after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views from the parquet.
The DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers, to the conclusion of the WM-main drunk a defeat and must now run in the quarter final against host Spain.
"We were too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," judged Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must be different against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danishs (10:0).
It's a pity that we couldn't take the Flow.
This was a bad game we have to delete from all," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entry into the semifinale, against the World Cup Seconds of 2019, a significant increase in the next Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German advertising in the Duell with the three-time Olympiager Denmark was the backspace player Alina Groseels with six gates.
"We weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," admitted backspace player Xenia Smits and asked: "We have to look forward quickly."
Not at height from front to rear
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the height with the attack.
Defects and technical errors in attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 backstand after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some paradens.
The first gate succeeded the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when greys successfully concluded a quick counterpart.
However, the expected initial inflammation was not.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women, the German women could hardly sit in scenes - and if they were, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandina Quarters.
So at 3:10, the game was running early after 20 minutes, since backspace player Mia Zschocke saw a little later red because of a hard foul on her counterplayer.
However, in the quarter final, it may take part again.
Only in the final phase of the first mid-term, the DHB selection was slightly better in the game and until the break at least on five gates.
The only quiet hope of a retirement after the change was already after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener-Schützlinge sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-founded opponent, who is among the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to increase performance and went as a clear loser from the parquet.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in Christmas

How was that with you at home at that time?
How with your partner\*in?
Do you want to share your traditions with your children?
What's the most beautiful for the kids?

Is musical?
Is the Christmas man, the Christian child, or is the gift of Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, all give up and around Christmas effort to have it as beautiful as possible as family.
Whether this is solid traditions or even something else every year: tell us how it was in your family!
Please send me some transaction number or something else that could help

I'd like to make a voucher code
as in #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Is that going to be with them?
The title suggests that I am active as an vaccine in mobile vaccine teams, where the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is (to date only) vaccine v.a. in nursing homes.
Since they are soon done to a large part, partly in vaccine centres thereafter continues for me.
I like to answer questions without time limits on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are personally related (e.g. "I take medication X, this complies with vaccination..").
In my task area, the vaccination information, the indication position (person is entitled to vaccination according to Coronaimpt vestment and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (not yet happens).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, such as medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have "only" (for God’s sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, which can't perform vaccinations (should?), so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations themselves.
Serious "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What, please, is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an amberger, the BR TV broadcast "We in Bavaria" has been provided for severe thoughts.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unearthed this time by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "human who's nervous."
And no one, "that everything has to go fast."
That, the people heard of the TV engineer, was totally wrong.
On which the man from Amberg told the solution and thereby also caused surprises in many upper males.
"The champion," the spectators learned, "is a lape with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by the Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical superficial term, derived somehow from the rather well-known word "children".
With which a gambling of education was closed - probably also with some who have long lived in the Amberg area.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After the confirmation, the following error message always comes: opens - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have started the #PRS_ORG#gel#PRS_ORG#n, rebooted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
tyre choice at the racing wheel- really so pann safe?
Today tomorrow I was awakened full of deeds because I wanted to train at least a little for the preparation of my bike tour in the next week.
Said, done, and I was driving with my racing wheel, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what happened in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) was lauded.
Glass splitters on the route.
Zack, loud cishes and my rear tyres didn't want to join the rest of the route at all.
Because I had no real opportunity to get my spare robe and spare hoses because of the week's day, I had to turn back with half a bad laune and take the first train home.
Then, too, launtechnically wasn't so bad, maybe it's better if I practice it again before the bike tour with the tyre change.
But now I'm facing a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days before me, I would get extremely unhappy of this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since the old tyres of the pre-owner (very nice old man, on the day when I came to pick up the bike up to 120km!) and who had already referred to it as sub-optimal because he had been rolling with them for more years.
But if I think I have to change a tyre when I drive to 80-90kms, then I think I'm really badly lazy :D
Now I came into the conversation with an older man at the railway station, wondering why I wouldn't have the marathon Plus tyres; they should be unplatable.
Now, of course, the whole sounds very appealing.
But are these really so incapable?
I don't like spending 40€/ripes now, just to be disappointed.
I also ask myself: I have at the moment on the racing wheel I believe 25x622.
They are also (likely?) at the Marathon Plus tyres, but most of them are already broader.
Is this a problem?
Or would you guess to me on a racing bike generally to other tyres?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Lie knows rather to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you beforehand for the help and dear greetings!
Car sludged against tree: driver fatally injured
On the B57, the 53-year-old was poured between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car from unclear cause against a central island and then moved to the counterway, as the police reported.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then slipped against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passengers were severely injured in the accident and brought to nearby hospitals.

After the publication of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a question of time until our SOLO series would again grow.
SOLO 15 is called the new vocabulary and visually reminds of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this proposal, a suitable designed foot is directly included in order to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in the length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in which the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role but is to be achieved an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such large sound pressure levels.
This does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears significantly grown and is extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
The SOLO 15 was voted with a slightly high tone increase.
This is generally common for broadbands to optimize the too high frequencies of strongly increasing bundling.
Exactly on the hearing square, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly rotated outside can reduce the high-tone range and thus make the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereodreieck is sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure an enemy dynamic that is looking for his same.
The SOLO 15 adds not only our SOLO series, but extends it in matters of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our sets, it is recommended at the beginning to make thoughts about the final optics of the speaker to plan appropriate changes in the construction process.
For example, if you want to furnish the housing, the reduction of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the furnace reappears material.
After all plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first bow a 8 mm hole into the ground plate at the appropriate place to be able to perform the cable without any problems there.
With the help of a upper froze, the speaker opens in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
Backside this opening should be fitted with a 45° phase to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100-6 OHM will be interrupted in the fibre, as shown in the image 'Detail Fibre'.
Afterwards, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these, the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now blew up.
It should also be used and adhesive the three displacements.
The fibres themselves may vary in the strength of material if necessary, for example, if you want to take back to finished powers from the construction market instead of making them themselves out of 16 mm MDF.
In the next step of work, the second side is fitted.
Afterwards all the plates of the foot follow, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circuit saw or a forest driller, it will facilitate the opening of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connecting clamp on the back wall.
Then you use a circular freezer to round all edges of the actual box.
The top of the floor can also be rounded off.
Afterwards, the footplate is sticked firmly with the foot of the walk and also screwed with long wood screws.
It follows the signing and proboring (2.5mm drilling) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connector clamp.
After the housing of wood dust has been cleaned (sucking / blowing out), you start putting the cable.
This is the easiest way through the 35 mm bass reflection opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncircumcised cable piece for pieces through the 8 mm boring into the foot to the terminal opening and leaves it out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker's opening, and it also makes it easyer to hang out there.
The frequency fluids are prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the frequency flux as well as the corresponding connection plan can be retrieved from the following document: assembly instructions soft solo 15.
If the frequency flux is built and the connection terminal is screwed, the seal of the 8 mm cable opening within the box, which is not completely locked.
By the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with something skilled, you can drop hot stickers on the opening and lock them so.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the contamination follows according to description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be solved at the Pluspol of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and attached to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
To prevent a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up a order now and leave it to deliver at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that we also organise the OSCAST this year again!
> For well-known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people by switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best, delay or other problems to avoid.
But hey, it is still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It's about 0:30.
Make drinks cold, plan good food and prepare for a long but very interesting night.
