Members of the National Assembly for Wales feared confusions with the Muppets
The proposal to amend its title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament) is abolished in some Members of the National Assembly.
The reason for this is to change the name of the National Assembly in the World Parliament (Walisean Parliament).
National meeting members of all political directions fear to become the target of the spot.
One member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name “reims with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.
For non-walisian readers: In the Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" for "aa".
A national meeting member of the Plaid Cymru Party indicated that the entire group was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was unlocked against the change of name, but pointed out the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is spoken similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly) which is currently drafting a law on the name changes said: "The final decision on names for the national meeting members is of course with the members themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Board published the results of a public hearing on the proposals for broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the National Assembly members, the World Parliament Members (Walish Members) or WMPs (Walish Members) were favoured, while the MWP option was the greatest support at public consultation.
The National Assembly members seem to propose alternative options, but the ring for consensus for President Elin Jones, who is supposed to present a draft law within weeks, could be a problem.
The law on reforms will include further changes in the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for disqualifying national meeting members and for the design of the Committee system.
Members of the National Assembly can finally vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonian votes in a referendum on a change in the country name
The voters decide on Sunday if the name of their country is to be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The Volksabstimmung was set up to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the similar name Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens' name has meant that this claim is raised in the Greek area, and has repeatedly expressed itself against its entry into the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a opposer of the vote on the change of names, said that he will not recognise the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's silence in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people with whom I spoke said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Adams.
"Today there is no longer both."
He said the disappearance of the bars could be perceived.
"The social life of people is different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly find themselves."
In the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets is not enough as long as the church leaders accept, and that they “will be back to the beginning or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with property apartments where people live who do not support the remaining refugees.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who enter into these property apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
In the 1930s, the original White Methodist community moved out.
A black community, which kept their services nearby, became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a Boykott of retailers in 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to set up or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's municipality members were planning rebuilding, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bell game as “the bells of the poor”.
The expert, who lauded the bell game in July, used other words: "A cultural treasure" and "an incredible historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game, played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was switched to the larger bell game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in the last months in St. Martin's is a complicated story with architects and contractors, partly attracted by the leaders of the church and partly by the Bishops Diocese.
In July, the municipal board, the leaders of the municipality, expressed written concerns to the Diocese, that the diocese would try to distribute the costs to the municipal board, although it was not involved in the commissioning of the architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some municipal members complain about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai hurts in California 13-year-olds when diving to praisers
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy when diving for praisers.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been with friends in diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's helping cry and riding with several others to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy was happy to have caught a praiser, but then he realized that the boy cried: “I have been bited!
I've been whipped!".
When Hammel arrived with the boy, he found that his entire key leg was rising up.
“I cried that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flew to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks before a shark had been seen in the area. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
For research purposes and for safety reasons, officials sperred the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but mostly they are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to prevent the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks cosmetical departments with specialized assistants, boats, superdrug and Debenhams.
In the context of a large-scale advance of the 2.8 billion British pounds comprehensive cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow while fashion and household records decline, the larger cosmetic departments in 11 branches will be tested across the country. If they prove to be successful, they will be extended to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics comes together with the search of supermarkets for opportunities to use otherwise used for television, microwave equipment and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's information, the extent of its cosmetic offer is doubled for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket performs a relaunch of its “Boutique” makeup series, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – a aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the parfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury's branch offices. The first sales office was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and a second will be opened this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to daily purchase of small food quantities in local needs goods shops means that supermarkets have to do more to allow customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the sales offices will increasingly look like shops, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight more services and non-food products against the discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has set up two years ago since the purchase of the chains Argos and Habitat in hundreds of branches of Argos sales offices and also a number of Habitat sales offices. This has increased food sales as well as the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganise its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
At the beginning of the 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats, which, however, ended after a discussion on the distribution of revenue from the drug dealer's branches in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branches comprehensive pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million UK pounds three years ago.
The company noted that Lloyds will play a role in the plan in such a way that in four branches a wide range of luxurious housing brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, is added.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Managing Director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the look of our cosmetic departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all the needs. Due to the lucrative surroundings and the favourable locations, we are now an attractive goal for cosmetic purchases that raises the previous kind of shopping."
Peter Jones “good” after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million British pounds
“Dragons” Den” Star Peter Jones is “great”, after TV engineer Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The “This Morning” engineer, 37, announced her withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby aroused “Dragons” Den” star Peter Jones by their very short-term withdrawal from their lucrative lifestyle brand company in order to focus on their own new connections with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was supposed to have been “great” when the “Golden Girl” of television at a tense meeting on Tuesday in the central part of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of their new businesses – in the value of up to 1.5 million British pounds – the common homewear and accessories brand Truly cannot devote enough time.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left Britain on the way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly, by far, had the highest priority for Holly.
It should ensure their future for the next decades in the long term.
Their decision to withdraw was totally surprising for all stakeholders.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, as soon as the market was launched.
In the centre of Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” engineer, which is one of the most promising stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions of market launch delays because of high investments in products from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, came as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a share of 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is supposed to become a brand messenger for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a moderator of the ITV "I'm A Celebrity".
A Jones nearby source said last night: “We do not comment on his business affairs.”
Hard words "and then we have fallen in love"
He was disgusting about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider "not presidency" and for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said that the voice of a news editor was imitating:
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore in June of Trump was a great step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
The denuclearisation negotiations have, however, been set up.
More than three months after the Summit in Singapore in June, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "comprehensive reaction" of the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the US held sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump showed himself much more optimistic in his discourse.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were standing before a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of the missile tests, support for the release of hostages and return of the mortal remains of American military nationals.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It is so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to come into this overfilled arena, about 200 people would stand here," said Trump and showed the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of human lives
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said they would not be used.
Although more than 10 percent of the population were displaced by Lombok, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilisation of international aid.
"In many cases, leaders have made them very clear that they do not require international support, so that is something difficult," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children compiles a team to travel to Palu, it is still not sure whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesperson of the Civil Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international bodies should participate in the assistance measures.
In view of the terrestrial shocks with which Indonesia is constantly fighting, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While in Aceh Tsunami protection accommodations were built, these are not a daily sight on other coastal stripes.
In spite of a warning that came into force, apparently missing tsunami warnings in Palu have contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia's numerous islands is already a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lazarett ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Wido has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure to the core of its election campaign and has spent plenty of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the next year re-election Joko suffers from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure by persistent occupational tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes and apartments when bands of Christians and Muslims were fighting on the streets with machetes, arrows and arches and other primitive weapons.
Attention: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a prime-League delight against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 level of his team in about 27 meters away from Chelsea.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the back punch.
The shot sailed high over the criminal chamber and drifted into the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the network.
“I've only tried to get myself into this position and come to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for me," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I have seen edge coming and had a contact with the ball. I haven’t thought too much about it and just accepted the shot.”
After a hit in the 25th minute, Chelsea led through the Belgian Star Eden Hazard to the mid-term with 1:0.
The Blues Tower returned a passport with the heel to Mateo, then turned down near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpooler half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good steep pass, so that Hazard came into the criminal chamber.
Hazard left the defendants behind and closed with a left shot at Liverpools Alisson Becker by the back of the network.
Liverpool plays at the Champions League's group phase on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the San Paolo Stadio in Naples.
Chelsea stands in London on Thursday at 15:00 in the UEFA Europe League Videoton.
Number of deaths of Tsunamis in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths of the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the Civil Protection Authority reported on Sunday morning.
Many people are supposed to be trapped into the ruins of buildings that had been brought into a collapse by the earthquake of strength 7.5 from Friday, which had triggered up to six meters of waves, the government speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was overcast with the ruined buildings.
Police arrested man, 32, for suspicion of murder after a woman was beasted
After finding a female body in Birkenhead this morning, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police invite the residents to report if they saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early stage, but I ask all who have stopped near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen something suspicious or heard to contact us.
In addition, I ask all people, especially taxi drivers who may have taken up something with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of utmost importance for our investigation."
A police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Today in the afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman have arrived at the crime site to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations run, and the police told her that she was about to inform the nearest members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now being informed that it will take hours until they can enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that now the whole area is treated as a crime place.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
It repeatedly, "this is so horrible".
At 2:00 a.m., two police vehicles were located within the lockdown and another vehicle before locking.
There were several police officers in the prison who monitored the housing block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call the number 101 or to contact crime stopers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and to refer to the 247 Protocol entry of 30 September.
The Cromwell stand in front of Parliament will be the subject of the dispute about the rewrite of history as the latest monument
Their exile would be poetic justice for its destruction of so many cultural and religious art products of England by its fanatic puritian followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "trustfulness" and "destination to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell was the target of the palace of Westminster.
The image tower in the English civil wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of the nineteenth century's view and part of the history of a figure that is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is more considered by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century than today, as a person who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course by monarchy.
Whether this is a completely appropriate representation is the subject of continuing history debates.
Surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents a side of this gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating them and remembering them."
Killer swine bites Chinese farmers to death
Local media reports indicate that a farmer on a market in the southwest of China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the name "Yuan" was called, was found with a decisive artery blood flown near a pig tall on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig tree is ready to inject pig vaccines in the province of Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005 in Xining.
According to reports on Wednesday, he had arrived with his cousin from Yunnan neighboring province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw a door open to a neighboring pig stall.
He said that in the stable a big male pig with blood was found on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pig had been dead to the farmers.
"The legs of my cousins were bloody and mutilated," the cousin, to whom the last name was called "Wu", was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
One market manager said the Evening News that the pig had been imprisoned to prevent attacks on other people, while the police gathered evidence in the Tatort.
According to Yuan's family and the market authorities, they negotiate reports on compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered severe injuries.
Ten years ago a 290 kilos of heavy pig tied up a whalesian peasant between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could slip the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012 in Oregon, a pig farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a "successor".
“They're just playful.
They like to grow and are very curious... they're not trying to hurt someone.
You only need to treat them with the right measure of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurrikan Rosa bring widespread strong rains in the southwestern United States
How predicted Hurrikan Rosa weakens himself on the way over the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding rainfall in North Mexico and the southwest of the USA.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a hurricane of category 1, and was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific begins to form a trough that moves east to the west coast of the USA. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the USA.
Rosa will trigger up to 25 centimeter precipitation on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture in the coming days generates widespread rainfall in the southwest through interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2,5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall can cause dangerous flutish floods, water-driven shoes and possibly earthrutsche in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeter precipitation is expected.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, the possibility of floody floods with rapid deteriorating conditions exists.
In view of the threatening tropical rainfall, it is urgently advised to walk into the desert.
Strong rainfall can lead to canyon's rising flows, and thunders bring local windbows as well as wind that leads dust.
The approaching trough brings locally strong rain into parts of the coast of Southern California.
It may be possible that the total rainfall amounts of over a centimeter, which can lead to low water-driven shelters and smooth roadways.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first individual tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, strong rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and continues on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the USA as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, in the middle of the USA, there is a good example of dramatic temperature differences.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next days, the persistent summer warmth is trying to re-establish and expand.
For a large part of the middle and east of the USA, a warm beginning of October with widespread temperatures is expected around 27 oC from the Southern Plain to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of over-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million observers have seen the hearing of board Kavanaugh
On Thursday, over 20 million observers saw the fascinating statements of board Kavanaugh nominated for the Supreme Court and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual attacks in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political Patt situation continued. On Friday, the TV channels interrupted their regular program for a turn in the last minute: one agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, which is the result of the FBI to conduct a weekly examination of the accusations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, she had beaten and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million observers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company assessed the average viewer numbers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcast the hearing, the figures were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring spectators in offices.
To return this to the right perspective: this corresponds to the number of spectators in a play-off football game or in the Oscar grant.
According to Nielsen, the channel Fox News Channel, whose mean-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the whole-day hearing.
ABC came in the second place with 3.26 million spectators.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.2 million.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republicaner had published a declaration that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as protesters in the elevator, on the way to hear the Judiciary Committee loudly threatened with words.
He stood with lower views for minutes while he was torn. The scene was transferred live at CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?"
"They have power, while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said that his office published a declaration and supplemented before the elevator concluded that he would have to say more at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks sent live hours later, when the Justice Committee was supposed to vote to the entire Senate on the transmission of the nomination of Kavanaughs for voting.
However, Flake said that he would do this only under the condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, demands the accusations of the candidates in the next week.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with a friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was evident that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes for the confirmation of Kavanaugh.
President Trump has initiated a FBI investigation of the accusations raised against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans for the withdrawal from the European Union in an interview with Sunday Times to use the future of Britain for political purposes and undermine the interests of the nation.
On 29 September 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Party Day of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In addition to the interview with her on the cover page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit, calling for a proposal that represents the mutual use of duties by Britain and the EU as "follow absurd".
Killing shots on Wayde Sims: Police captures suspicious Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
In connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU), the police arrested a suspect.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested by Baton Rouge's police for death.
The authority published video recordings of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
As reported by the WAFB CBS partner station, the police secured the glasses in the Tatort and said that the glasses of DNA were found at Simpson's glasses.
After a survey of Simpsons, the police announced that he was on Wayde the deadly shots.
The Advocate noted that the deposit had been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shoe wound on the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the criminal technical laboratory of the federal police, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU-port director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive authority for “their care and their pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 m wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season, he achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the Basket Ball Trainer of the LSU said, Will Wade, that the team was “deeply shocked” over Wayde's death and“ stand under shock.”
"You are always afraid of this," said Wade.
Vulcan spit ash in Mexico City.
Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital from the volcano.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the crater and had been registered within 24 hours of 183 gas and ashes.
The Authority supervised numerous cases of grows and shocks.
Pictures in social media showed thin ash layers on the windscreens of cars in quarters of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics found an earthquake of strength 7.1 Central Mexico since September 2017, increasing activity on the 72 kilometres southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before anniversary of independence
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after collapse between the willing police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the polarising independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, which was held back by the willing police, bought them with eggs and also slipped colour powder, so that in the streets normally populated with tourists, dark dust clouds were created.
In the course of the next day, hand joints also came with the police who used their strokes to impede the fights.
For several hours, pro-independence groups were scanned 'no forget, no forgiveness' while Unionists opposed them who called 'lang live Spain'.
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for smaller injuries in the protests.
One year after the 1st October referendum, which was seen by Madrid as illegal, but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very excited.
The voters had decided by an overwhelming majority for independence, although the participation of election was low, since the voters mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent votes in violent conflicts against the electoral sites.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors on Friday overnight to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists said that he sees the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence no longer with hope.
“ Last year we have experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could choose, but now we hang fast," he said.
Despite an important, though scarce, victory at the regional elections last December, the Catalan Pro Independence Parties this year had difficulty maintaining the vibration. Many of their most well-known leaders are either in exile or in detention, where they are waiting for their procedures because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was struck by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting increasingly excited," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been investigating since the end of last year, announced his candidate for the election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European election, the best way is to pronounce the degradation of democratic values and the oppression of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after house was framed by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been ramped several times by a car.

Menga-Treffer means for Livingston 1:0-Sieg about Rangers
Dolly Mengas first gate for Livingston secured the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hits proved to be crucial for Gary Holt's team to be able to compare Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team stays in this season without outward victory in the Premiership and faces the hearts that lie back eight points next Sunday.
Previously, the Rangers are hosts in the Europe League for Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase its victory series in the division to six games, i.e., Chief Trainer Holt has not yet been defeated since his acquisition of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for freely playing guests
Holt's team should have been in leadership for a long time before the hit, since his direction had the Rangers faced the most different problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, however, became slower in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could shoot far after he was infused to meet Craig Halkett's head shot by the gate.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play before themselves, as they knew that they could hinder guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive gate came.
The Rangers allowed a free collapse, and Livingston prepared a chance to bring Menga together with Declan Gallagher and Robinson in shot position. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the center of the criminal room.
In this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership but could not overcome the host's defense, and Torkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unilluminated.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced to defense.
Scott Pittman was defended by the Ranger Torhüter Allan McGregor with the feet, and Lithgow slept the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanken came to Livingston’s penalty room again and were regularly removed from the danger area, while two criminal offences were denied – one of Halkett’s consigned Glenn Middleton and one for handplay.
‘Phänomenal’ of Livingston – Analysis
Alaska Lamont from BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have exceeded the expectations of this upward trend.
Their style and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt pays great praise for the way in which he has wake up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led to an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held on track throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as they were under Gerrard at times, they could not reach this standard.
Her last ball was inadequate – only once they could penetrate the team of hosts – and that is something like a call for the rankings in the middle of the table.
Received Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) smiling faces and blue skys ruled when the government leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO associations.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of press and EU accession to Turkey.
Then Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security reasons for the fact that a 25,000 people were able to gather in front of the mosque. Many followers, however, found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also made hearing. They condemned Erdogan's politics as well as the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the polarising effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German doors as hero and swept by others as autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicycle driver dies when collapse with car
When a collapse with a car, a cyclist died in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. in the UK, near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a road in Deptford, southeast of the city.

According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and to notify his next family.
Road blocks and redirections for buses are set up, and the drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officials injured in injuries
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in distress in a high-security prison for men.
The turmoil broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still stopped.
Specialized Tornado officials have been attracted to terminate the turmoil that involves eight inmates and which are limited to one wing.
The officials were treated on site for minor injuries in the face.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: “It was specially trained in prison to remedy an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police will be handed over and may be spending longer time behind grids."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prisoner was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, office officials were called to prison in order to deal with severe distresses in which the staff had been attacked with pool balls.
Hurrikan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flut-like floods (drough areas may benefit)
It rarely occurs that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week when the remains of Hurrikan Rosa move over the southwest-shaped deserts and bring about the risk of flut-like flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for flut-like floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa approaches with rain on Monday evening and goes directly across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a Tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cycles as tropical storm or tropical depression have come near to 320 kilometres!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center forecast 5 to 10 centimeter precipitation with up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest-shaped desert, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5 to 5 centimeters and a total of up to 10 centimeters.
For those in which there is no risk of flut-like flooding, the rainfall associated with Rosa can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although flooding is of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, since drought is currently prevailing in the southwest.
According to the U. S. Drought Monitor, in slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drought occurs, the second highest category," reported Weather.com.
First, the path of the Hurrikan means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have a maximum wind of 136 kilometres per hour and will be 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Then the Hurrikan will move north with 19 kilometres per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will meet on colder water and thus weaken.
Therefore, it is expected that Rosa meets land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall may fall strongly in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora forests, precipitations are expected from 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible", reported Weather.com.
Then Rosa will move northward as a tropical storm over Mexico, reach the border to Arizona on the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression and then move through Arizona upwards to the south of Utah until the late Tuesday evening.
"As a major risk, very strong rainfall is expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora desert and the southwest of the USA, which is characterized by deserts," informed the National Hurricane Center.
As a result of these rainfalles, life-threatening flooding floods and water-driven shots are expected in the desert as well as mountainous terrains.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests attempted murders
According to the finding of a 16-year-old in Somerset, three boys in a teenage age and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teen was injured on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to the police of Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the wheelstock area.
The officials asked all who have records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered “under the community, the anger" of the Democrats.
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard tactics of the Democrats," said Trump at a exploration in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered “under the community, the anger” of the Democrats during the whole nomination process.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday before the convention and rejected the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford, he had sexually harassed them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also expressed accusation at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliantness, the quality and courage of Kavanaugh this day.
"One voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for confirming one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the general," he said the amount of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican electors in the intermediate elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our life.
I'm not going to do it, but I'm actually going to take it," he said.
"Therefore I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission to “done and block resistance”.
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate at the latest on Friday, said a high employee of the GOP approach to CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia, victim numbers rise
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were swept away as a result of a strong earthquake and a tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit gigantic waves on the beaches.
Hundreds of people came together on Friday at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when, when the darkness collapsed, up to six meters of waves struck the beach, and many people rose to death and destroyed everything they were in the way.
Tsunami had preceded an earthquake of strength 7.5.
“When the threat of the tsunami arrived yesterday, people still went on the beach and didn’t run away immediately, and they fell victim to him," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Civil Protection Authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami did not come alone, he swimed cars, tree trees and houses, he met everything on land," said Nugroho. He added that the Tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he met the coast.
Some people were climbing on trees on the flight from the tsunami and had survived, he said.
Some 16.700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Air recordings published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, curved and crashed bridges as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town was shaken by further descendants.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a declaration that the energy released in the massive quarry of Friday addressed the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb cast on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown, said the authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "sumptive" and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were crashed.
According to his information, the bodies of some victims were found under the ruins of crashed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damages along the coast could have been higher 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the vines.
According to Nugrohos, communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, and there was no information.
According to an explanation of the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and his employees and volunteers are on the way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse," said the statement.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticized that it had not informed of the fact that a Tsunami Palu had hit, although the waves had arrived officially at the time of the warning.
Amateur photographs published in social media show a man in the upper floor of a building who desperately warns the people on the street under him from the nearing tsunami.
Within minutes a water wall on the shore and floats buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not check the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The tsoenami and tsunami have resulted in a massive downturn of electricity that interrupted communication around Palu and enlarged the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send freight aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuates still need food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and was only opened for assistance.
A visit by President Joko Wido was planned for Sunday at evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees in tent accommodations in the courtyard of their office, but, in words, Dosebas passed on the scenes of desolation.
"They told them that they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the helping groups began to start the disaster aid, some asserted that professional foreign helpers would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and staff from abroad are only possible until the place of disaster has been declared as a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened until now.
"In the moment it is still a catastrophe at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, that is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but until now this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami decreased over Palu from Friday, friends and family members hoped for these to be missing on one of the miracles that illuminated the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a wastewater channel.
On Sunday, rescue forces liberated a woman who had been trapped two days in front of her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paraglider for the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Others in the Roa-Roa Hotel were prisoners, as Mandagi added, his students.
“As an senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional load to bear," he said.
Gendon told him how in the hours after the news of the inturn of the Roa-Roa hotel under the paraglidern, WhatsApp messages had desperately sent to the competitors from Palu who participated at the beach festival.
His news, however, resulted in gray questionnaires instead of blue chickens.
"I think that means that the news has not been posted," he said.

Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name – in Ye.
In announcement of the change to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The officially known being Kanye West).
West, 41, has used the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eight album published in June.
The change takes precedence at Saturday Night Live, where the publication of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
It is a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has rejected for 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not just a shortening of its current professional name, but it has a religious significance for the West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’," said West this year in a conversation about his album with Radiomoderator Big Boy.
“So I'm you, I'm we, it's us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only’, only ‘Ye’ – just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is more reflecting what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with the West earlier, has already written his name with and without binding and upper letters.
Mexico's AMLO praised not to use the military against the civilian population
The chosen Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador praised never to apply military violence against civilian populations during the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to “never use the military to suppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration on the square and killed 300 people. At this time, left-oriented student movements were involved in establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador praised to support young Mexicans by monthly aid for students and the opening of further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training have led young people to criminal bands.
USA should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double their expenditure on research in this field, says investor and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow on KI announcements of various areas of the US government, even if the US generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become No 1 by 2030 in the field of KI innovation.
"The doubleling of the budget for the AI research would be a good start in the face of the fact that all the other countries are so far behind the US. We are looking for the next KI breakdown.", Lee said.
The doubleling of financial resources could double the chances that the next big KI success would be achieved in the USA, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University at a KI system that defeated the highest placement American Othello player. Later he was leading leader at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee honored former technology competitions of the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), asking for the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Read words, researchers in the USA often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China takes away the academic top forces, but the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have set up Coryphes of universities in recent years to work on KI.
According to Read, a changed US immigration policy could also be beneficial to the US's KI activities.
"I think that in the field of the KI, professionals should be offered automatically Greencards," he said.
China's State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to reading, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations grants money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to be involved in the partner from industry and science. In addition, the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced the investment of 2 billion US dollars in the 'AI Next' initiative this month.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million US dollars per year in KI research.
In the meantime, US law regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not done anything for months.
Macedonian votes in Referendum on a change in the country name
On Sunday, the population of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to 'Republic of Northern Macedonia', which would contribute to a decades of old dispute with Greece which had blocked Macedonia's requests for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim is raised in the Greek area, so Greece has put a veto against Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum. A Boykott campaign doubts that the participation of the election will reach 50 percent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting list was: "Are you a membership in NATO and the EU by adopting the Agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of names, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs, argue that the price for Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth taking in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the screen of the European Union, as it all means a safer life for us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would follow the result so that it is crucial.
The change in the name would require a two-third majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports on irregularities by 13.00 p.m.
However, the election participation was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 percent of the registered voters had voted.
"I am here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a elector in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko give their voice in the Referendum on 30 September 2018 in Stramica, Macedonia, on the change of the country name that Macedonia would open the way to accession to NATO and to the European Union.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the elevated heads, not through the rear entrance," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others such as China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be for this, since more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his voting.
According to his words, a "Yes" result would be a "conference of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum. This number is below the necessary participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote with 'yes'.
To ensure that the referendum is successful, the election participation must be at 50 percent plus one voice.
A failure of the referendum would be the first heavy strike for the prowest government policy since its takeover in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero by Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Brighton defense to reach gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling travelled at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday the Brighton defense at the 2:0 victory of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hits look ridiculously in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a passport in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He rushed between three Brighton defense players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green tricots.
He played around a defendant and then conquered several other defenders at the edge of Brighton's criminal championship.
Then he shot a pass left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the criminal room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overlaid Mathew Ryan with his right shoe Brighton-Torkeeper and shot to the right side of the network.
"Aguero fights with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We had talked about him to play 55, 60 minutes.
This has happened.
We were lucky that he had reached a gate at this moment."
It was Sterling, however, who provided Sky Blues with the initial advantage in the Premier-League-Duell.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net shortly before he swept into the out.
City plays in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the rockies game
Since the nationals were excluded from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force a further use.
However, the always powerful Scherzer hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday but only if this is relevant for the rockies that have a game lead in the NL West before the Los Angeles Dodgers for the Playoffs.
With a 5:2 victory over the nationals on Friday evening, the Rockies achieved at least one wildcard, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we are not playing anything, we can at least throw the atmosphere with the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The nationals have not yet announced a start player for Sunday, but according to reports, they are inclined to let scissors throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, for which this was the 34th use as a start player, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington Right Handling has a statistics of 18-7, a ERA of 2.33 and 300 Strikeouts in 220 2/3 Innings.
Trump stops explosion in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in connection with the board of the Supreme Court, which he selected for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican electors in the intermediate elections.
“All that we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our life.
This is one of the big, big – I don't approach, but in reality I'm going to take action, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, horrible group of democrats, you see it happening now.
And they are determined to take over the power again with all means, you see the community, the abomination.
It doesn't matter to them who they violate, who they have to cross to obtain the power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission to “done and block resistance.”
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats as "wrathful and mad and dishonest and dishonest".
He named the most ranked democratic in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud calls for the audience.
“Do you remember their answer?
Have you let the document go outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer leaves all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party agreed to blame me, this came little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who are told that they are not welcome, just because we say our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly as she had energically raised against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the betrayal request that I represented a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, about the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, about similar issues that Jeremy with former top politicians did not agree.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that “the meetings should all be involved and productive”.
Mostly, the Friday evening GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour Member were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most of the sessions are not characterized by this sound, and the promised 'friendlyr, more cautious' policy has long been forgotten if it ever started.
It becomes increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed as to whether it is accepted by the top of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader. Members with whom I previously believed to share similar political views expected to make a turnover and take positions with which I would never have agreed otherwise – whether with regard to national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – where it doesn't matter what I say – follow a swamp tirade in the social media that calls for my election, calls for the political center and says that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better than some of my colleagues, since the comments to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of the colleagues, who face each day a flood of sexual or racist insults and never give in.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance last week.
In fact, we do not let all the opinions apply, and with any consent and any change in the rules of election, the party becomes more vigorous.
I have often been advised over the last two years to take my head and to express my opinion not so clearly, and then I would have "no problems".
But I haven't gone into politics.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, caused by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom in the overall school was literally broken apart, I have fought to join the Labour Party for better public services for those who need it most – as a municipal council as well as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a hole from my political views, not even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would only like to say to the supporters of the Friday application: I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I am proud to serve you, not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, regardless of whether they are Labour Members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many decisive threats or political thoughts will not prevent me from acting the best interest of you all.

Ayr against Melrose 38:17: Unslaped Ayr team rises at the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennt's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams at the top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as to their better use of opportunities, and trainer Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in our games until now, and we are still unspoiled, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Rekenning for Ayr, they have better exploited their opportunities than we are.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, led Ayr to the lead. However, because of a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, Melrose was able to speak the numbers, and Jason Baggot started an unincreased attempt.
Climo built the leadership of Ayr with a criminal treachery before he reached a hit directly at the mid-term and then made an increased attempt in all, so it stood for the break 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then a longer interruption came due to a severe violation of Ruaridh Knott, which was worn by the field. After the continuation, Ayr developed his lead through an increased attempt from Stafford McDowall by Climo.
Then the captain of Ayr acting Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again at the end of a phase, Melrose made enormous pressures to pay the additional man by a non-elevated attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson achieved from the crime street from a touchdown behind the leading Ayr package.
As almost since the interruption, Climo increased after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's Boxkick and sent off flank player Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
“Still Game” star seems ready for new career in the gastronomy
“Still Game” Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change in the host industry after it turned out that he was called Managing Director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles along with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next nine seasons will be the last of the mission, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in rising in Glasgow's "florating restaurant shop".
“The sea belongs to us”: The Bolivia, enclosed by land, hopes that a court opens the way to the Pacific
Matross patrol in front of the seaquartier in La Paz, decorated with a dew.
On public buildings, a lake blue flag is wounded.
Fleet support points from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon are the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Recovery is a duty."
Everywhere in Bolivia, which is included in the country, the memory of the coastal section that is lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is as much alive as the desire to go back over the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as it has been for decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a judgment of the International Court of Justice to be held on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Bolivien has the vibration, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
In the country, many Bolivians will follow the IGH's judgment on large screens, hoping that the Court in The Hague decides for the benefit of Bolivia. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate by sovereign access to the sea after decades of sporadic discussions.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial struggle for his re-election next year, the judgment on Monday is also at stake.
"We are shortly before returning to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts think it is unlikely that the court decides in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The UN organisation with its headquarters in the Netherlands is not authorized to address the Chilean territory and has established that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that IGH's judgment is already six months after the final pledge, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert, suggests that the case was “not complicated”.
In the course of the last four years, far from supporting the Bolivian case, there could also be a relapse.
"The current Bolivian government has resolved the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She pointed out that Morales' warrior rhetoric sent Chiles to any remaining good will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their conversations some time, but after these events, this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the decision of the Court was exceptionally rapidly taken.
On Monday, Bolivia has an extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile, and an opportunity to ‘ put an end to the 139 years of disputes for mutual benefit’, he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, use the theme of the sea as a political cruise.
"Bolivien will never give up his right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is a chance to recognize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament takes place only if it can trust the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never dispose of its nuclear weapons first if she could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the Heads of State of Rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time, at the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, more than three months after the summit with North Korean Head of State Kim Jong-un in Singapore seems to be in a short position to rebuild the firm nuclear diplomacy.
Ri referred to the idea that further sanctions and resistance from the US against an explanation to end the Korea War would ever force the north into the knees as “Hirnspinst”.
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the declaration without taking essential disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pjöngjang seriously thinks it is abandoning an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjöngjang for next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Mode views in Paris show the latest collections for huge head covers that will be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or shield the sun completely, you no longer have to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy over-sized head covers for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Except unpractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their exciting creations over the walking stage.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige-coloured hat with a spring-like wide edge that pushed the heads of the models straight.
As more overdimensional accessories, water melons, a magic hat and even an ananas were shown with jewels. However, they are not intended to warm their heads.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were fitted with embroidered lips and had more similarity with Hannibal Lecter than with Haute Couture.
A creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkels and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted squirrel.
And if you want to set another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Mode observers predict that the huge head covers could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The over-dimensional hat follows directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with 60 inches wide edge, all wearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractical hat, which struck large waves in the social media, sent another large creation over the staircase: a beach bag of straw, which was almost as large as the model wearing a bathing suit that kept the pocket.
The bast pocket in red orange with bast franses and a white leather henkel was the highlighting piece of Jacquemus' Summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris fashion week.
Prominent-Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect that large hat and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has so much excited that the demand for over-dimensional accessories will hardly be ignored."
John Edward: Indispensable language skills for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools continue to be characterized by academic excellence. This has continued with further outstanding examination results in 2018 and is only undermined by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other joint ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to serve their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools are aimed at preparing their students for education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as a world citizen.
As a sector of education, which can create a tailored curriculum and implement it, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we can not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current test results of this year are found that languages with the highest level of existence are at the top of the ranking lists of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved the note A.
From the data collected by 74 SCIS member schools, 72 percent of the students in Mandarin achieved the Note A in the higher exams, while 72 percent of the students who learned German, 69 percent of the students who learned French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish, also achieved the Note A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as electoral subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and other places.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons that employers mentioned for the problems of occupying open jobs were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly needed when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open languages require, these knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Depending on the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future by such a lifelong ability.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual persons will automatically provide a lead before competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to lead a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak several languages, in particular languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will be educated, which, in view of 2020, are the most important for the United Kingdom, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests are, independent schools will always choose a number of languages with accordingly specialised teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and provides them with the skills necessary for their success, as always the future looks.
At this time in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as ‘international communication capacity’.
Independent schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice, diversity and excellence.
You might be fair.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James arrives for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, waiting will soon end.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of the presaison against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes he will play is not yet fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48" said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twittered that James probably will play just a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked after training for his plans for the six games, a comprehensive seasonal game plan of the Lakers.
“I don’t need a pre-aison games to prepare myself during this stage of my career," he said.
Time for Trumps Kundgebung in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of campaigns.
This is the first of Trump's five constellations planned for the next week, among other things in well-hearted places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build up support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the convention.
When does Trumps Kundgebung take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trumps Kundgebung in Wheeling, West Virginia, is planned for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (Ostküstezeit).
You can watch Trumps Kundgebung in West Virginia as a live stream at YouTube online.
Trump will probably address the hearings of the board nominated for the Supreme Court Kavanaugh to accusations of sexual misconduct that were conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected senate agreement on the confirmation remains in the sweat until a week, while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this series is to support Republicans who have to make difficult choices in one November.
Therefore, President Trump’s group of elections against Reuters announced that these five admissions would serve “to mobilise volunteers and followers, while the Republicans are trying to preserve and develop their majority in the Senate and in the Representative House”.
"The control of the convention is so important for its plans that the President will travel in as many states as possible, while the operating election season approaches," said a Trump election fighter who did not want to call his name to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, on the advertisement of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and reports media from Pittsburgh" planned for tonight in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump attempts to support the Republican Senate candidates in surveys from West Virginia, Patrick Morrise.
“It is not a good sign of Morrisey that the president must come to try to drive him up in the surveys," said Simon Haeder, Politologian at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows a fighting willingness to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four parties on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the momentum is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one in which the players really believe, and that especially in competitions like this.
So where is the momentum of their opinion now?
“They were in leadership with six points, and now it's four, so I think this means a little momentum for us," said Jordan Spiet when leaving the playground.
Europe is of course in advantage and lies four points ahead, while twelve others follow.
However, the Americans feel something wind in their sails according to Spiet and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spiet and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show three out of four points each.
Spieth was insecurely strong from defeat to green and goes with good example.
The well-tural enthusiasm screams were louder in the course of his round, when he resigned an important coat to decide the fourth match with four points for both of him after he and Thomas had put back two holes with two points.
His cup, who chose the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar cry that suggests that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“I really have to kneel in and take care of my own game," said Spiet.
That's all that's still going to the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have achieved more points in the last two days than Spiet and Thomas and have no doubt written the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal, but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and cannot make anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who had not beaten Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the apparently between them and the exhausted amount of flowing energy undermines that they are the players to beat it on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who are sealing a possible European victory during the sunset over Le Golf National.
preferably both at the same time at different holes.
But to speak of European glory would be early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the Fourer Heroe of the morning, who played with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes brought the Spanish and Sweden into a clamp that they couldn't easily overcome.
On Sunday, however, nobody can help them out of the clamp.
The four and four couples are so fascinatingly viewed by the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or not, and the way a strategy can change rapidly.
The Europeans have played better as a team and are clearly in leadership on the last day. However, this four round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, had doubted.
Europe will go on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
After the four and four partitions, Europe lies ahead of the United States with 10:6 and goes with a solid jump in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari played two victories over Tiger Woods, who were able to book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the fours in the morning against the incorrect American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parts, the US was more opposed and won two matches, but couldn't pick up the back.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve individuals played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood, the first European newling, won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend, won four points in the history of Ryder Cup.
After they hit Woods and Patrick Reed in the four, they harmonized excellently and hit the decisive Woods and the American newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had been swept through two matches on Saturday, occasionally let his brilliant shine up, but now 19 of his 29 matches in four and four parts and seven in succession.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the fourth morning, returned and played the four parts as a partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, not everything went according to their ideas.
The three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measuring lat for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the four, they won 2&1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter for Spain and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four parts 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only occurred twice that a team returned after it had gone into the individual with a back of four points. However, as a title holder for Furyk's team, a difference is enough to keep the trophy.
After standing in second place for two days, it doesn't look like they could start a counter attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
On Saturday before the United Nations, North Korea's Foreign Minister said that continued sanctions would deepen their distrust to the United States and would not give the country unilaterally to its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that last year North Korea had taken essential measures from good will. For example, it stopped nuclear and missile tests, cut off the nuclear test site and committed not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We do not see a corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, there is no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances we will not first dispose of ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri trusted North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase-wise” approach in denuclearization, which would be rewarded for successive steps in North Korea, his statement seemed significant in so far as it did not reject a one-sided denuclearization from the front, as Pjöngjang had done in the past.
Ri pointed to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an official US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In this Kim had assured that he was working on the "deuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump had agreed to guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks an official end of the Korea war run from 1950 to 1953, while the United States said that Pjöngjang had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
In addition, Washington objects to a halting of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
'The US is on 'first denuclearization' and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even against the 'Declaration of the End of War',' said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into the knees is a brain spider of those who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not refer to plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Head of State had highlighted at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean Head of State Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea would be the other party in the denuclearization question, it would not have come to this abstainment in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
Nevertheless, the sound of Ris speech was enormously different from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target with North Korea missiles on the continent of the United States after “the wicked President" Trump Kim had referred to as the “Raketmann” for suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened with the "follow destruction" of North Korea last year, was commended by Kim to the United Nations for his courage with regard to disarmament steps. However, he said that there was still much work to do and that the sanctions would have to remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – doesn't matter.”
China and Russia argue that the Security Council of the United Nations should reward Pjöngjang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must in any case be energetic until we have achieved complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has strengthened sanctions against North Korea unanimously to dry out Pjöngjang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes financially.
Pompeo met Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pjöngjang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he said on the departure from Pjöngjang that progress had been made to be accused only for hours later by North Korea, he put “the most-like claims”.
North Korea praised this month at a meeting with the Moon, a rocket base and an atomic complex when the United States took "compensive measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the desired "relevant measures" were security guarantees that Trump had given in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at the University of Harvard ensures that all students in the basic study get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the widening Macho culture to keep themselves alert with caffeine and to learn about the whole night.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, and in his opinion is the first such course in the USA.
He was inspired to call the course into life after holding a talk about the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“A girl came to me at the end and asked, ‘Why do I know about it only now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, and that surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
This year's course for the first time explained to the students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's healthcare services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after she found that students suffered heavy sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a residential home and click on coffee bags, curtains, training shoes and books. They receive information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of sleeping deficiency on sports performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
Then they are encouraged to think about their daily routine using a map of the university site with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoking affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a "night layer" is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the increasing pressure on the students made a growing problem of sleeping.
In order to ensure good sleep, all students should be the “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. In addition, a weight increase could be avoided, as sleep withdrawal puts the brain into hunger mode, so that they were constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course. He had spent one of his courses last year in his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push on a university course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar study program before taking up their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, the students should put themselves awake for sleeping time and wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light, e-screens and LED lighting, and can bring the circadian rhythm out of the tact. This leads to problems in sleeping.
Livingston against Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forced Gerrards player
The Rangers lost another outward game, when the hit of Dolly Menga for Steven Gerrard's unanimous team meant a 0:1 low position at Livingston.
The Ibrox manship wanted to book her first outward victory since the 4:1-Triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's first second defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team is back to eight points behind the leading hearts in the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before the mid-term, and the inspiration-armed Rangers seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers are now falling at the sixth place, Livingston rises at the third place and is only behind Hibernian during the Tor Difference.
The Rangers also threatens further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by a apparently thrown object from the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that Ayr conquered and reached the half final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players who took the hearts a point last week, and would have to be thrilled as his well-trained team held their opponents on a step and tread under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball ownership, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
After just two minutes, they should have reached a gate when Mengas first levy Scott Pittman led to Allan McGregors gate. However, the middle field player missed his chance and shot right there.
Then a long release from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was able to shoot only on the back punch.
The Rangers took over control, but their game worked more hopefully than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos evidently felt that after a quarter hour he should have suffered a criminal offence from a collision between him and Steven Lawless, but arbitrary judge Steven Thomson did not apply the complaints of the Colombian.
In the first half, the Rangers only reach two towers, but the former Ibrox torhoeder Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a tasty shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's results in the 34th minute may not correspond to the game history, it is not to deny that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the rest and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted in the mid-term and exchanged coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediately effect when the wing player made Morelos position, but the impressive Kelly rashed from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game they had, while Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded her leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stopped well and refused Jacobs before Lithgow had a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also demanded a criminal strike lately with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Gier Counter
And now a page from our “Sonday Morning” Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist John Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of exploring and measuring radioactivity, an invention which eventually led to the device known as the geiger teller.
Since then the standard element of science has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is this in all the world?”
Rogers: “This is a giant teller used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “That is, I hear a boy!"
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention that bears its name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can contribute to the immune system to “see” deterred cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy deterred cells.
The vaccine contributes to the immune system as part of the treatment to detect deterred cells.
In the method, a patient is taken of immune cells that are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a many types of common protein and then be injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovary cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect deterred cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is used to remove immune cells that are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” the many types of cancer common protein HER2 and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancer” including breast, eggstock, pulmonary and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which immune cells are taken and taught to attack cancer cells has helped to treat leukemia.

Kanye West was exterminated at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had praised far-reaching US president Donald Trump and said he wanted to join in 2020 as a presidential candidate.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and carrying a Make-America-Great-Again-Cap, he continued with a chimney cannon against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I'm so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He's racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I had left America long ago," he said.
SNL started the mission with a sketch with Matt Damon, where Hollywoodstar made himself fun of board Kavanaugh's statement before the judiciary committee of the Senate to the accusations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of Wests Schimptirade was not sent, it was uploaded by the comicist Chris Rock into social media.
It's not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about West.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulty behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They cheated me behind the stage.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
You've shaken me!
And then they say, I'm in a lost area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the lost area?" He said he will “take my supermancape, because that means that you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His remarks resolved at least twice buhrs from the audience, and SNL employees were embarrassed, reports Variety. One person said: “It was deadstill in the studio.”
West had been committed lately as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many with a talk of the title "I Love it", where he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the Conservative Group TPUSA. She twittered: "To one of the most courageous spirits: DANKE, DISS YOU DO YOU DO THE MASSE ENTGEGENGESTELT."
The Talkshowmoderator Karen Hunter, however, twittered that west he was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I do not want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes a harmful ideology to my community and gives himself (in order to buy his music or his clothing or support his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same applies to us.", she added.
Before the broadcast, the Rapper had announced to Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist who changes his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His Rapper College Snoop Dogg wore the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the dead music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" (The Artist Formerly Known As Prince).

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington attacks toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the Machoheld. He said that such roles on the screen would have resulted in that boys often feel to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with “The Sunday Times Culture”, Harington said that he believed something was wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic maleity in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married the "Game of Thrones", who also participated in "Game of Thrones", also 31, admitted that the solution to the problem was "very important".
"I personally think the question is very important at this time, what has been wrong with maleness," he said.
"What have we taught upbuilding men about the problem that we now observe?"
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives boys the feeling to have this particular side of a man embodied?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
For with the young men, there has been clearly something wrong."
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series, he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones" after the end of the series.
As of November, Harington can be seen in a new edition by Sam Shepard's “True West”, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told him that he was the best to "Game of Thrones" that he had met his wife Rose.
"I have met my wife at this mission, so I have received my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantasy series Ygritte with numerous Emmys, the lovers of Harington's character Jon Snow.
In June 2018, the two married to Leslies family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 only about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in the majority of the new cases of sex.
HIV has so far spread in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been almost reduced to zero, Chinese health officials indicated at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in the annual comparison, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100.000 in China.
The HIV transfer through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT members should be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transfers are due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medications to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees have sent through the data of GOP senators, criticizes "threatening lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, Member of the U.S. Representative House, voted on Saturday claims, a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Members.
Democratics from Los Angeles believed that the claims of "ultra-right-oriented" experts and websites would be distributed.
"Laughter, lying, and even more abominable lies," said Waters in an explanation on Twitter.
The information published is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate Committee to the accusations raised against the Supreme-Court Candidates Board Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three Senatoren interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the contributions was associated with Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is totally wrong and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and wrong accusations, was in no way responsible for transmitting this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ declaration quickly triggered criticism online, including those of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This dementi is angry," wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of the convention.
Those who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You shouldn't be proud.
You must not question the motives of the defendant.
You must be quiet and left."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of being angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who arrives at the mid-term elections to dissolve waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if this is true," he twittered.
Waters said in her statement that their office informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the offenders are revealed," she continued, "and that they are taken account of all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for all my staff's members."
Criticism of “Johnny English – Man lives only three times” – weak spionage parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to search for Brexit references in every British-coloured new film. This also seems to be true for this revival of the action commodity parodye franchise "Johnny English", which in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spion that put it up" and began in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now Just Right" again.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject, as obviously we are, become the new export opportunities for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glossy, grimasses cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time for melting. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general funny creation for cinema visitors in the non-English-speaking room.
Of course, he is again the cloaked secret agent, who bizarrely considers himself cool and world-man, while he actually contributed from something clouseau, a prise Mr. Bean, and a clack of this Burschen, which consists of a single note on the title melodie of “The hour of the winner” at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind travellers and international secret agents, which Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV spots.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and shortly denounced the rotor leaves at his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comic is present, but the humor seems quite weak and strangely overflowing, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-certainly commodian elements.
The humor seems to be more directed to children than to adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy misgeschick is not as infallful and focused as Atkinson's stumbling film gag in the role of Bean.
The ever-actual premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A Cyberhacker has infiltrated the super secret British spionage network and unveiled the identities of all British agents in use, very much for the failure of the service agent, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw halm for the Prime Minister, a blown and troubled figure, which is already in the face of its political in popularity before the complete collapse: Emma Thompson gives its best with this Quasi-Teresa-May-Character, but the script doesn't give much to work with
Their secret service advisors inform them that all active spies have been detained and they have to get someone out of retirement.
This includes the tollful Johnny English itself, who is now working as a teacher at a sentiment, but is unofficial in the work as an undercover agent. There are a few gages, as English offers a “School of Rock” spionage academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall to an emergency meeting and reunited with his formerly severely tested Kumpan Bough, which is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-Boot commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine has been somewhat forgotten.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terrible wrong in the secret service of your Majesty, are again in action. They encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fame Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is in danger in the banning of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy. This claims to be able to solve the UK's computer problems.
English and Bough start their Odyssee of the Great Spies: As Kellner dresses, they put a delicious French restaurant in fire, they take care of chaos when they smuggle on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English dissolves pure anarchy when he tries to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house with a virtual reality headset.
Although all registers are drawn in this last sequence, however sympathetic and funny it is also, the topic is already dealt with in detail in child television.
Very moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself: "Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really justifies his talent?"
Labour disputes working on a plan after which the British work four days a week, but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
According to the party, the heads of the company will report the savings achieved by the KI Revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to the workers.
This would have been a three-day weekend, but the same payment would still be received.
According to the sources, the idea of the Party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favour of workers.
The conversion to a four-day week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to use the benefits of the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “A directive review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is consistent with the party's approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers as well as the general industrial policy strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. Already the Green Party promised the introduction of a four-day week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the overall approach is not supported by the Labour Party.
A speaker of the Labour Party said: "On a four-day week it is not party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancell John McDonnell conceived his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy last week at the Labour Conference.
McDonnell said that he was determined to recover the power of 'anonymen directors' and 'profitmakers' in public supply companies.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water supply companies may not retain their entire share, as a labour government could do 'deduction' due to supposed misconduct.
He also confirmed the plans to call workers into the boards of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to pass 10% of the own capital of private enterprises to the employees who pay annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy express themselves in the news magazine "60 minutes", whether the FBI's investigation could change their opinion in the case of Kavanaugh
The FBI investigation on the accusation of Judge Board Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Judge to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the results of the Republican Senator Authority could influence in order to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could do something, which could eventually change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I told in the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was expressed, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined, and indispensable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been melted in stone.
"My opinion is firm about board Kavanaugh, and it would have to place a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: board has hit this feather," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And those who called them could not confirm."
It's 36 years now.
And I can't find any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has been contributed to reducing poverty in the context of this festival?
This Saturday, in New York, the Global Citizen Festival takes place to fight an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an even impressive mission – poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which takes place this year for the seventh time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness for the real goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place in 2012 for the first time, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international group of stakeholders tries to fight poverty by increasingly motivating people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks, including actions such as voluntary work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (e-mail or phone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal – fighting poverty.
How successful is the project if you remember that Global Citizens remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea to look forward to a cool free concert, a meaningful way to convince others that it is time to act, or only another case of so-called Clicktivism – if one feels to change something by signing an online pestilence or sending a Tweet?
Global Citizen informed that since 2011 the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters and achieve different objectives.
These actions should have contributed to stimulating leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least 10 billion US dollars have already been paid or purchased by Fundraising.
According to the Group's estimates, the guaranteed resources have to date direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important obligations include the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom, who have committed themselves to support children in their optimum development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with 35 million US dollars fighting malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the United Kingdom Government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, informed the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also noted that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK, the government announced the financing of the The Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children and provides food interventions.
As an answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They replied: “There will be a long and challenging way with heights and depths.
But, like the major civil rights and anti-aparty movements in front of us, we will have success, as we are together stronger and more influenced.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who appear at this year's event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as a moderator.
The US could use the Navy for blockades to hinder Russian energy exports – Interior Ministry
According to Washington Examine, Washington can withdraw the navy if necessary, so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, US State Minister Ryan Zinke informed.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is a pretext for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think the true reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new sales markets in the field of energy, just as in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the officer, there are means and ways to deal with this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and block them, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he informed.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that understands itself as a 'stimm of electricity consumers' in the USA.
He made a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they were practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he called Russia as "One trick Pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was in expanding the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and thus replaceing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, the government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became the "convict" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2-pipeline value of 11 billion US dollars, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kreml argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy is not to be used as a means of exercising pressure and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received counterwind from Germany that confirmed his commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federal Association of the German Industry (BDI), called on the USA to keep themselves out of the EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said the board of the BDI Dieter Kampf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Wladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “examine properly” a presidential candidate for 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
On Saturday, the Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced that she would “examine” a presidential candidate after the intermediate elections.
During a Town-Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she considered a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which includes women at the top.
Warren plans to ‘examine a presidency candidate' after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump leads this country into the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has not taken a leaf before her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a twot on Friday, she announced that before the vote, of course, a FBI investigation is necessary.
However, a Thursday survey showed that the majority of the Warren electorate do not believe that it should be candidateed for 2020.
According to the survey of Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential electors in Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not deceive.
32 percent of the voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent who support potential candidates, and 48 percent who are against them.
Among the other names of prominent democrats, which come into question in view of a possible candidate for 2020, the former Vice President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would decide officially until January.
Sarah Palin speaks at the Donald Trump-Ralley on posttraumatic stress disturbance, under which track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son through is what he's going through when he comes back, it's all possible for other families who feel the effects of the PTBS and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return,” she told the audience at a ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "elephant in the room" and said about her son and other war veterans that they are going back to change that they are coming back to a broken, they come back and ask themselves whether there is such respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military have given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of a woman for domestic violence, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Police Authority of Wasilla.
18 Federal States and D.C. support a legal instrument for new asylum policy
18 Federal States and the Columbia District support a legal instrument for the new US policy that denies victims of band activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District received a court expert statement in Washington on Friday in order to support an asylum applicant who questioned the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace-gegen-Sessions complaint submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not announced.
She informed that her partner “and his violent band sons” abused them, but US officials rejected their asylum contribution on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where many people ask for asylum in the United States, as nations who have struggled with major problems with criminal bands and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy raised a decision of the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals, allowing illegal immigrants to apply asylum on the escape from domestic violence.
In a statement on Friday, Karl Racine, the General Association Attorney of the District of Columbia said that the new policy “Don’t ignore nineteenths of legislation at state, state and international level.”
'The Federal Law prescribes that all asylum applications are assessed based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and that court violates this principle', was stated in the Court’.
In addition, the lawyers argued that the policy that immigrants refuse to access the country has an adverse impact on the economy in the USA, as immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workers.
In June Jeff Sessions, the General Confederation Attorney ordered that immigration judges no longer allow victims who flee from domestic violence and violence to asylum.
"Asyl is there for all who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or because of fear of raciality, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political conviction," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to resolve all problems by granting asylum, even all serious problems with which people have to fight worldwide every day.
Despaired rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles with time
For survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It's all very excited," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little fevering son in a rescue center in the ruined city center of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Inhabitants returned to their destroyed houses, to collect her possessions and goods, and to store all that they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of hospitals who were damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5 were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who joined the spinal breach and a broken shoulder, remained outside the military hospital of Palu, where patients were treated in the outside site because of the persistent strong hinds.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the fierce earthquake shocked the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“ Everything went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the walls,” he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for the stay in the city was a wedding.
“ I heard my wife’s calls for help, but then I was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. Ambassador complains China of tyranny with 'propaganda advertisements'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had launched a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper that announced the mutual advantages of trade between the USA and China, the US messenger in China accused the state capital of Beijing to exploit the American press for progaganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after accusing China to intervene in the U.S. convention elections on 6 November, a suspicion contested by China.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the U.S. elections correspond to the communication of US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exercise pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an eliminating trade war, with customs duties on imports for both countries.
Chinese repayment duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in countries such as Iowa who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. messengers in China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, who exported largely agricultural products to China, informed that Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and companies.
China, said Branstad in a position in Des Moines Register from Sunday, now double this tyranny by turning propaganda in their own free press in the USA.
"With the spread of their propaganda, the Chinese government claims the tradition of freedom of expression and the independent press in America by switching the country's paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
“In contrast, you will find only in limited number of contradictions on the newspaper skies here in Beijing and do not find any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have about the disturbing economic development of China, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers did not accept the offer for the publication of its article, but he did not call the name of the newspaper.
Republicans proclaim voters before the intermediate elections with the debakel around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, in the light of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the upcoming intermediate elections which could in particular result from women.
The mood in this context was extremely excited, and most Republicans have already stated that they continue with a vote.
“Solche things can’t be undoed”, Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill informed for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that the load-minute forecast by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was sufficient for a FBI investigation to seduce annoyed voters.
"Frauen don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow or not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called in the hallway of the Senate “November is coming” when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold the nomination of Kavanaughs and that despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, Stu Rothenberg, an unparty political observer of the news page.
“The people say it's already high, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially with electors in the suburbs and younger electors, people between 18 and 29 who, although they don't like the president, often do not choose."
Even before the public statement of Ford, in which their accusations of sexual attack against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a counterreaction could result if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a stronger confusion for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the body, the final vote or the Kavanaughs review; it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group who supports the election of Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem unanimously to believe who they are due to the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were definitively or probably convinced of the statement of Ford, while 35% indicated that they were definitively or likely to give Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38 % indicated that they believe that Kavanaugh was likely or definitively lying in his statement, while 30 % indicate the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently examining the accusations presented by Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford gave a statement last week before the Senate Justice Committee that at the age of 17 she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had unbleashed her against her when they were at a party during their studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans the launch of a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, currently brings a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where to store their data and who can access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee best said that the intention behind Inrupt was the "world domination".
"We have to be active now," he said on the topic of startup.
"It is a historical moment."
The app uses the technology of Solid so that users can create their own personal online memory or a POD.
It can include contact lists, tasks lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and business sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all contents are available in a browser and at the same time.
The special feature of the personal online data storage is that the user can decide who can access the data alone.
The company describes this concept as a personal strengthening and development of data.
According to the CEO of the company John Bruce, the idea is behind Inrupt that the company is using resources, processes and appropriate capabilities so that Solid is available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been abandoned for the work on this project as well as a community voluntary programmer. A security platform acquired by IBM is also used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee informed that he and his team will not exchange themselves with Facebook and Google about whether to make a comprehensive change in which their entire business models are completely transformed overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a contribution to medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee made a new design of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been importantly involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the Web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Viktoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Viktoria Cross as a fighter during World War I, was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
On 29 September 1918, Oberstleutnant and Priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his use in attacking Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a scarf protector and never learned that he had won the highest British War Award.
His two grandsons revealed a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbol power, since the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the hero's act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Oberstleutnant Vann led his Bataillon over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918; by dense fog and under severe guns of field cannons and machinery.
Later, he drifted into the fire line and led the line with the 'great twistness' before he rushed out with a field weapon in all the way and switched out three of the military units.
On October 4, 1918, Oberstleutnant Vann was shot by a German sharpener, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the acts of his grandfather were something that he could never be justified, and at the same time something that makes one humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a crown after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann indicated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the twistness of a real hero would be visible mainly by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The invoice of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared themselves for their struggle, the viewers in the United Kingdom were not amazed as suddenly to see Peppa Pig.
Some remained unaffected after they stayed awake until the early hours of the morning to see the fight especially.
A fan described the change to the trick film figure on Twitter as somewhat bad shit.
"On the basis of a government regulation, this content is classified as not youthless, so it was necessary to change at 6 a.m. to a child broadcast," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the Marketing and Communication at Bellator when he was asked for the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The Board of Directors at Bellator, Scott Coker, informed that the company will edit the schedule to take into account the future of the United Kingdom viewers.
“I think the problem could already be solved in the recurrent game," he said.
“But it's 6 o'clock in the morning at one Sunday with the viewers in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we're staying.
When changing, it was quite much communicated. It was very nice and it wasn't always all nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical disturbance.
What wasn't the case, it was a problem by the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in the normal case, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “submit”
Tom Daley, who participated as a waterspringer in various Olympic games, says that he grew up with the feeling of being undermined by all others because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old thought that he had only realized at the continuing school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he has expressed himself on the subject of pregnancy rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victory in the Olympic Games is no longer so important for him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses disease condition for a few months.
In the first release of Laverne, he said that he had previously considered himself inferior to others, since love for boys and girls was socially inacceptable.
He said: “By today it is sense of undermining others and being different from the others, reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-fold bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games today is a prominent LGBT activist and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he expressed himself on this subject because, happily, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The three-fold world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The knowledge of in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married 20 years old Oscar winners in the previous year, but he shared that the age difference had never been a subject.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and adolescents – he took part in the Olympic Games at 14 and his father died three years later in cancer, it is difficult to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple has a son who has the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his entire viewpoint has changed since then.
Last year, it'd have been all about gold medals with him.
But for him there is now more important than Olympia Gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main gain.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after the diagnosis of braintumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the coming death, and one of the last things he asked was the tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be in front of it.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and only afterwards I finally realized that he is not in victory," he continued.
In 2012, Daley won the Bronze Medaille at the Olympic Games.
“I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in Olympic games in front of home audience – that was the madness," he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud of Heather Small – was also influenced by this. He heard the song in the front of the Olympic Games and was still caring for ganshew.

Mickelson, currently not in form, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to try very hard so that the whole will not become a debakel.
Mickelson, who plays at the event for the 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday to the replacement bank.
Instead of being at the center of the event, the five-fold major winner spent his day to fire others and to work on his game, in the hope of fixing the problems that are burdening him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the close Le Golf National golf course, where misleading balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself would not be discouraging enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth game on Sunday at the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, Neuling at these tournaments to win all four games this week.
If the Americans put a hot start at the 12 single games with four points, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk said confidently to Mickelson and couldn't add much to that.
“He was perfectly clear about his role today, gave me a lap on my back and laid his arm around me and meant that he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He belongs to the world-known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I wouldn't have thought he was in two games.
I've imagined more, but that's how it's been running and that's what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games carried out on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup drive that never entirely corresponded to the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson could record 18 victories, had to put 20 defeats in and reached seven half-times, although Furyk told that his presence has already enriched the team.
“He's funny and sarcastic, originally and likes to make some fun, and he's a great man who's popular with the entire team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little closer this week, and it was fun to watch them.
He is a truly interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can be over with the lead soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an inappropriate situation.
In 1997, the Danish debuted in Valderrama, where a team quoted by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans, but only barely reached the target line and went in the lead with the smallest possible jump and a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“The thought remains that we had a great jump in Valderrama, we had a great jump in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won but just short," said Bjørn (pictured on the photo), after seeing the victory 5–3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all team members that it's not over.
Tomorrow, it's gonna be right.
Put yourself in the stuff and do the right thing.
The whole thing is only over when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and exactly there is our focus.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are fully aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Happy about the performance of his players at a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overthrow it.
Tomorrow a different calibre will be.
Tomorrow, the single performances are in the foreground and this is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things run well, but if you're alone out there, you'll be tested as a golfer to the limits of your skills.
You need to make it clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also needs to get out of the best."
Unlike Bjorn, his opposite about Jim Furyk will be careful that his players are better cut off individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those big turns on the last tournament day. He stood on the winner side in Brookline before he stood on the side of the loser to Europe's "Wunder of Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word," he answered the question like the Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start you saw in Brookline and in Medinah.
When the momentum hits in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to be magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task to get out for a counter-tack, he must join Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the ranking list.
"I have decided for the boys in this order, since I believe it covers everything," says Bjorn about his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship is again delayed
The latest fregats of the German Navy should have been served in 2014 in order to replace warships from the time of the Cold War. However, it will be delivered according to local media due to defective systems and rapidly growing costs at the earliest next year.
The operation of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ headship of the new fregats of the ‘Baden-Württemberg’ class has now been moved to the first half of 2019, according to the time calling for a military speaker.
The ship should have been employed in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were ordered by the Marine in 2007, are supposed to replace the old fregats of the Bremen class.
They are intended to contain a powerful canon, a series of flight defense missiles and sea target aircraft as well as tar technology such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest fregats do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays can lead to the outbreak of the high-modern warships that Germany is supposed to represent as a marine power at the time of their operation, according to The Time.
Last year, Fregat F125 was persecuted by the disaster when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship after its delivery to the shipyard.
Little was known about the reasons for return, but German media called a series of significant ‘software and hardware errors’ that the new ship had made unusable in a fighting situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 matrosses, only about half as many as on the older fregats of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too hard, which leads to performance losses and prevents the marine from implementing upgrading measures in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of 'Rheinland-Pfalz' seemed to be as difficult as twice as ships with a similar class used by Germany in the second world war.
In addition to the incorrect hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, became a problem.
Apparently, costs increased to breathtaking €3.1 billion compared to the €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest fregats are particularly significant in the light of the recent warnings that Germany's maritime power shrinks.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Wehrbeauftragte des Deutschen Bundestags, confirmed that the navy “goes out of the capable ships”.
Bartels said that the problem was growing over time, since old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the fregats of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken away from the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of the bats
In a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research will be carried out to show how bats use the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will enable further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals, helping to guide future nature conservation activities.
The study conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will detect dwarf and mug bats as well as the brown long ear and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed on key positions on the property to record the activities of the bats during the entire season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
A sound analysis of all recordings by experts determines the frequency of the batch calls and determines what species do.
A card and report of the habitat will then be created in order to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the countryside level.
Rob Dewar, Naturschutzberater for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for the bats and how these are used by every species.
These data will help to determine and demonstrate the benefits of measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Flederm stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to the loss of living space.
Windcycles and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flyers and the chemical treatment of construction materials or also attacks by domestic cats.
Fledermausen are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching probe.
They use a featured echo to detect insects and obstacles in their airway.
The NTS responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across Scotland takes the theme of the bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspections of beds and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only Fledermausreservat in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 Fledermausspezies.
Good administrator David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there are many things we do not yet know about bats, so here and other goods we are carrying out these works that will help us to learn more about what bats need to feel well."
He stresses the importance of excludeing the presence of bats before maintenance in the goods, as it is possible that the unwilling destruction of a single nestplace could kill up to 400 females and young animals and eliminate the entire population on site.
Fledermausen are under protection and it is illegal to kill them, to harass them, or to destroy them or to destroy their nestplaces.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have to learn much about bats, and in many of our species we do not know how it is about their populations.”
Ronaldo disagrees rape accusations while his lawyers want to complain the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape accusations against him as “Fake News” and said that people want to “be famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to complain the news magazine The mirror, which published the accusations.
The storm of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of rape in 2009 by an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
He then expected to pay $375,000 to buy her silence to the incident, said The mirror on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their publication as “Fake News”.
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the balloon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to complain the mirror because of the accusations they referred to as “inadmissible reporting on suspicions in the privacy sector” according to Reuters.
Lawyers Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a loss for “moral damage at a level that corresponds to the severity of the violation of law, which is probably one of the most serious injuries of personality rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident was supposed to have happened in 2009 in a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were supposed to go to the player's room where he presumably raped them, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went on the knee after the alleged incident, and she said that he was “99 percent a good guy” who was the “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but say it was unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but had later entered into an extrajudicial agreement, as she had "angered for retaliation" and was concerned to be "reduced publicly".
The 34-year-old said that she was trying to lift up the agreement because it was still traumatized because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was shortly before switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and switched this summer to the Italian giant Juve in a hundred million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘ewigly repent’ to the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “ewly regret it” if it lost its status as a world-wide leading manufacturer of cars according to Brexit, according to Economic Minister Greg Clark.
He continued to say that it was “sorgeous” that Toyota UK told the BBC that the production in Burnaston’s work at Derby would have been abandoned, so Britain should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the influence of delays at the border at a no-deal-brexit could lead to loss of jobs.
The work in Burnaston, where Toyota's product lines are produced by Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience production stops in our work at an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also made fears about a hard EU exit without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that it will close his mini work in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, relate to risks within the supply chain with a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a “just-in-time” base, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes of suppliers from both the United Kingdom and the EU to make the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, the limits could be interrupted, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and closeness in the parts.
Toyota would not be able to lead a stock in Derbyshire in the work that had been sufficient for more than one day, so the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa Mays Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU “is well designed to avoid such controls at the border”.
“We need a deal. We want the best deal, which, as I said, enables us not only to enjoy the current success but also to take this opportunity," he explained in the broadcast Today of BBC Radio 4.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long the production would have been interrupted, but in the long term warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest functionary of the Unite Society in the work, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience never comes back when they are away.
A government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trumps planned meeting with Rosenstein could be moved again according to the White House's information
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “slided for another week”, while the dispute for the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, it was said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has examined the supervision of the work of the Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who examines the elections by Russia, connections between Trump's consultants and Russia, as well as a possible legal impediment by the President.
The question whether Trump would fire the Vice Justice Minister and thus endanger the independence of Muellers, has been the subject of germs in Washington for month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of the secret recording of his talks with Trump and the president's appointment with the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his supposed resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was at this time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump said that he wouldn't prefer Rosenstein to leave it, but then the meeting was moved to prevent it from colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trumps press speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
On a question of meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for it. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed for another week, given all the things that are just going on with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press on the running."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference of the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her for the reason.
Sanders said that the low frequency of the press conferences did not lie on a disagreement to the "effect hatching" of the TV reporters, but admitted: "I wouldn't disagree that they were engaged in efficiency."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would take.
The President makes more question-and-response-runs than any President before him," she said, without giving precise evidence, "We have viewed these figures."
There will still be press conferences, says Sanders, but it is, “if the press has the opportunity to ask directly questions to the President of the United States, but much better than to speak to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen that we have often done it in the past weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignificents.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he had a bizarre appearance from the rower before he was gathered.
Health Minister writes for Brexit concerns to EU employees of the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health addresses those from the EU-Germany who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express their desire to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of requests for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
Freeman wrote in your letter: “In the course of the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British Government has also strengthened preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the distressing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each person and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, thus benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to emergency surgery after a head injury
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, the linebacker of Tennessee State Tiger's Christion Abercrombie, after a head violation, was committed to an emergency operation on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's chief trainer, explained that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the sideline and was simply broken up there," says Reed.
Trainer and medical staff provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a wearing and transported for further investigations.
A spokesman of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville,Tennessee that Abercrombie left the OP at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "not yet any details about the nature or extent of the injury are known" and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Butcrombie, a so-called red shirt, plays at Tennessee State in his first season after switching over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, making it a total of 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchase in the United Kingdom
In the UK, investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the future. The additional revenue will benefit the new plans of the Conservative Party Obdachless
This step aims to impose the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to young electors
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects more than 120 million pounds per year to help homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign investors have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with the added revenues of homeless.
This step is an attempt to impose Jeremy Corbyn's success on young electors who promise to provide more affordable living space and take top servicers to the visor.
The increase in stamping tax will be levied to individuals and companies which do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenue will be added to the government campaign against homelessness.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase of two years ago to two apartments and homes left to rent, the deposit may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance accounts for up to 120 million pounds per year by step.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built real estate in London are purchased by investors who are not resident in the United Kingdom. This increases prices and it is more difficult for first buyers to take foot in the real estate business.
Many wealthy territories of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has spoken for a reduction in the stamp tax in order to enable more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies to uphold real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end the UK's 'living room damage'."
Opposition leader Corbyn announced an exciting series of proposals for housing reforms that range from a rental price bond to the prohibition of premises without a legitimate reason.
He also wants to give city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May explains: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream, according to which life should be better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be right for people who do not live in Great Britain, as well as for companies who are headed abroad to buy real estate as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become far for too many people and the invaluation of homelessness remains a too big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My greatest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says it's his 'greatest goal' to become the manager of the Scottish team at some time.
The 42-year-old Schotte enjoys the challenge of collapsing the association from the North East of England's new life, which is just on the third place in the League One and lacking the three points to the top.
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish League in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I managed it to the bank and that was it," Ross told the broadcast Sport Sound of BBC Scotland.
“But as a child I often saw Scotland play in Hampden with my father, and this is something that always draws me back.
However, this option would only come if I had been successful in association management."
Ross' predecessor in the role of Sunderland includes Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Chief of Alloa Athletic said not to be afraid to enter the footsteps of such an established name in such a club after he had previously rejected offers of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured with me at the moment, whether I can lead the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities in this association, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he explained.
"It's not a easy task to get him there, but I'd only appreciate my time here as a success if I'd bring the club back there."
Ross can present a first three-year management career, after a phase as Deputy Chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as a Trainer in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says that he now feels better than ever in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"This was probably a real separation path," he recalls when he took the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds weird because I didn't feel bad, could live well, and experienced some very pleasant high stages.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I still do this through stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now I've done it. I never felt so well in my skin in my whole life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30 a.m., so a study
The heat wave in summer has missed the revenues of Britain’s crying pubs, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 percent in July. However, the revenue from the restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA corporate consultancy, which compiled the figures, said: “Long sunshine and England’s longer than expected continuing participation in the football world championship meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, in which pubs could record sales increases of 2.8 percent.
The decline of 1.8 percent, which the restaurant industry recorded in June, continued in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on beverages showed the best performance, with a surface-adjusted sales development, which rose higher than they fell at the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also left in the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to get out of a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6 percent per month, while the sales of foods decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for leisure and restaurants RSM, said: “These results continue the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sporty events remain the biggest factors for the turnovers in the Out-of-Home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but turnover losses of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful as compared to the previous year, in addition to the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come for operators of businesses with a focus on food at a worse time and it remains to wait for the more gentle temperatures in August to provide the urgently needed atempause."
The revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in the brand rollouts.
The sectoral conversion monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the Pub, Bar and Restaurant area in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined sales of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from his parents
One study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students at further schools has found an increase in so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The message fires fears that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a 'main account' in order to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, create accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at further schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a link to the Instagram Photo Sharing website.
The message fires fears that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of the students indicated that they had a clean 'main account' which they could show to their parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who found on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked others to “rape me.”
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half awarded private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being led to creating online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes "Stimm of the Athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member at its annual General Assembly in the Council of the Scottish Light Athletic Association of Scots Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most often excellent light-atlet, and Ian Beattie president described the choice as a great opportunity for sports functionors to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the Easy Athletic Association of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world and we are sure that the light athletics in Scotland would benefit very from their choice in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance of over 200 and 400 meters at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, called his own four Olympic gold medals, and today often appeared as BBC experts, could no longer run after a transitional transfusion disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say that no one can say whether or how far I'm gonna be healed.
It was hard work, but I have recovered completely, have learned to run again and make movability practices today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps comparing mothers with cows provides excitement in the network
A producer of dairy pumps provided excitement in the network with an advertisement clip in which breast-feeding mothers are compared with the milking of cows.
In order to introduce the market, according to its own statement, the producer of consumer technology Elvie published a not very seriously meant music video to highlight the freedom that gives the pump breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a chicken-filled shore with cows in the background to a song that contains text lines like: “Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a cock at me” or “If you have not noticed it, they are not Euters but my breasts.”
The Refrain continues: “Pumple it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladys.”
However, advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has triggered a controversy on the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video found mixed reactions among the spectators, many of whom say that it is the “frightening” of the milk industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply this product with cows.
Just as we do, they need to be truffy and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within a few days of birth," said a comment.
The dairy pump of Elvie fits thisnt into a Still BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Reviewable traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: “So a non-realistic advertising.”
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that you found the song “urkomic”.
“I think that's a great idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breast-feeding.
When I was pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to interpret him.
This is a generous product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement addressed to mothers who use milk pumps (oft at work or on toilets) and feel like “cows”.
This is not an advertisement for or against the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that all have done with the discreet pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps indicate to feel like milk cows.
The Pump of Elvie, however, is completely smokeless, has no wears or sleeves and fits discreetly into a still BH, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partners and ECD with Mother, said: “The Pump of Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she earned a daring and provocative market introduction.
By comparison of breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges that are going on, while at the same time presenting the incredible feeling of freedom that enables the new pump.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump went into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared for designer Marta Jakubowski on the Catwalk as she used the product.
Hundreds of migrants were silent and quietly brought to a tent town on the border of Texas
The number of migrants in interns is as high as never before, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively equal, among other things, since intensified rhetoric and measures of the Trump government have made it more difficult to accommodate children in supervisors.
Traditionally, most of the maintainers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become a target disc for an expulsion when they report to pick up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential maintainers and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official of the customs authorities' immigration and customs enforcement, explained before the convention that the authority arrested tensing people who had applied to the care of unmatched minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons had no previous entries in the criminal register.
“According to 80 percent of those who are self-containers or members of a household of an advisor, illegally stay in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
In order to be able to handle the children's cases faster, officials introduced new rules that, according to the staff of accommodation for some children, require to appear within a month rather than 60 days after the preservation of the court, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear by video switching and not personally in order to face an immigration judge for their legal status.
When deciding negatively, the person is rapidly suspended.
The longer these children stay in custody, the more probable it is, according to the accommodation staff, as well as reports that have been known from the system last month, that they are being anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are strengthened in a larger facility such as Tornillo, since there are signs that a child has problems, because of the size, more easily overlooked.
They also explained that it could strengthen trauma that many of the children already suffer when they are brought to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to adopt friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish occupational forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally located on Syrian grounds with the pretext of the fight against terrorism and are treated accordingly.
"They have to withdraw immediately and without condition," he explained to the Assembly.
Moualem stated that “the war against terror was almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011 and millions of other people were displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus “will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purified” both by terrorist groups and “everything illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has stationed about 2000 soldiers in Syria, who trained and advised mainly Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 soil troops in the war-bounded country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and he accused “some Western countries” to“ spread irrational fears” to prevent refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make it possible to return home," he said.
"They polite an essentially pure humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no construction aid for Syria was granted as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomatics of the UN explained that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebellion high-level Idlib represents the possibility of propulsing political discussions.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province in which three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed its hope that military measures against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front, which is bound by Al-Qaeda, will be "eliminated".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to launch the first meeting of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members in order to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and to set the way to elections.
Moualem mentioned the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to the revision of the articles of the current Constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal observers probably hope, prematurely terminate an office or a scandal.
This would certainly be the most dramatic final of a presidency of all times.
So far there are no signs that the spectators would have satisfied.
Since 2014, the switching rates at the best time for CNN have doubled to 1.05 million more than doubled and nearly tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million spectators at the best time of broadcasting, compared to 1.7 million years ago. MSNBCs “The Rachel Maddow Show” led to an average of 3.5 million spectators on evenings with important news.
"This is like a fire that attracts people magically, as it is something we do not understand," says Neal Bear, showrunner of the Drama Series "Designated Survivor" on the TV-Sender ABC over a cabinet member, the President will be destroyed after an attack destroying the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-aged comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her that he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘because he brings me to laugh’” said Scovell to me.
The chaos has fun.
Of course, the stories from Washington, in contrast to what is to be found on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible composition of families and the health of the global economy.
Deactivate is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes to be an informed citizen, when one becomes aware of having been watching six hours of an expert round, which is based on Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for its book "Fear", Paul Manaforts $15,000 expensive bomber jackets from Strausenleder (laughs Washington Post a "cleading lot of self-assance") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's breaching description of Trumps, ahm, anatomy.
For my part, Super Mario will never be able to see again with the same eyes.
“A part of what he does can feel like a reality show that he introduces to each evening," says Brent Montgomery, Chief Business Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the series “The Three of the Pfandhaus”, about Trump's rotating occupation and daily practices (a dispute with the Football Liga NFL breaks, Kim Jong-un prizes).

Donations flourish the closest races around seats at the convention at the intermediate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donors, thanks to the new borders of the districts of election, which led to two officials in the race to stand around the same seat.
The recently re-signed suburban district in Pittsburg is a member of the Democratic Conor Labm, who won its seat in another district during a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb is against another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards were resigned after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were cast against the Constitution and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a fall exchange of election financing between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a well-observed special election in March at the 18th district of the state.
This seat was held by a Republican over a decade, and Trump won the lead there with 20 percentage points.
Polit experts give the Democrats a light leadership.
The US examined the punishment of El Salvador for its support for China, but then turned back
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized without being opposed to great resistance from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama to the partner of the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all US foreign decrees from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of 'the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan', said Heather Nauer, spokesperson of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, it was thought about criminal measures, which were estimated to be $140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar assembly in the previous year and was a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the US.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wish the conference to take place and thus effectively terminated the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now a spokesman at the mid-October conference in order to make a sign of the importance the government of the Assembly is given according to diplomats.
The three American diplomatic representatives are quietly and quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and to the Dominican Republic, without new screwed communications or criminal measures from Washington.
A government speaker of John Bolton refused an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to express themselves on the internal discussions under the condition of anonymity.
Their opinions were reaffirmed by one of the government's close external analysts, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next great surprise could be the report by the Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible disability of justice, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is also supposed to examine whether Trump's campaign team conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the majority of congresses change, Trump faced with an organ that forces him to account, exactly at the time when he passes on to the voters again; and possibly before a jury.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I do not want to say that the Donald Trumps case, or that is inevitable to its European pendants.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938 German officers were willing to perform a state strike against Hitler if the West had merely opposed him and the Czechoslovakia had supported him in Munich.
We have failed, and we missed a way of avoiding the years of the barbarians that followed.
The course of history is about such turning points and the incontinuous march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump leaves the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, so the man who decides about the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in Devil's kitchen since last year's newspaper reported that he suggested to record the president secretly and speculate whether inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein dementes the presentation of the New York Times.
"How will we answer if the newly ordered FBI investigation of board Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or he is confirmed in office despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and misunderstanding?
And above all, will we vote in the intermediate elections for a convention that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these trials, a long winter is ahead of us.
But I think we won't fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jewish, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime once occupied by my ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me away 60 years later to flamme Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimisticly before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that after the impressive remise against Villareal in Spain, a victory against the Austrians will move them into a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the Europe League at the beginning of the month.
Due to a knees injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear to be equal to Villareal until 2-2, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jumping board for greater.
"This was an important point for us, because Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We have gone into the game with the conviction that we can do something from it and we have driven home with a point.
Perhaps we could still have won at the end, but as a whole, a difference was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we tried in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a heavy game, as they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can go through this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with all what happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good on it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can look forward now, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of age prevention leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants knew exactly how to care for them, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the national-wide study indicated to talk to your spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent indicated to talk to their children about it.
"The people want a family member to care for them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of National Life Security Spare.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caring you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you want to be maintained, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial consultant on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenditures.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include a traditional nursing insurance, a hybrid capital-based life insurance to help cover these costs or self-security with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Submit legal disputes in the last minute.
If you set up a precautionary power so that you order a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals meet your wishes, you should not be able to express them yourself.
Also consider a power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your invoices are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with air gun
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he went home after a work with friends.
The victim, a man in the 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot into the chest, the abdomen and the hand.
Officials describe the shots that occurred at about 02:30 British times as a "willing act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that met on Friday to the Indonesian city of Palu, the authorities said. The number of deaths is still rising.
Because of the disrupted communication systems, helpers were unable to obtain information from the government district Donggala, a region north of Palu, located near the epicentre of the earthquake with strength 7.5.
In Palu, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi, and is a coastal area of over 300 km (180 miles).
In the government district, a administrative unit below the province, there were estimated 299,200 people living in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of intervention of the Central Sulawesis economy, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickelab construction is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite Sulawesis coast.
According to Indonesia's Civil Protection Authority, Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West-Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996, where nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Firering, and is regularly plagued by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatras triggered a tsunami on December 26, which met 14 countries and cost 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shocked the West Coast of Sumatras between the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands on the Sumatras coast.
2006: An earthquake with strength 6.8 shocked the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and dissolved a tsoenami that met on the south coast and demanded almost 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with strength 7.6 encountered the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with strength 7.5 shocked one of the Mentawai islands before Sumatra and dissolved a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozen villages and demanded about 300 human lives.
2016: A light earthquake shocked the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the fatal earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people died from a stormy building.
2018: Serious earthquakes encountered the popular Indonesian island Lombok with tourists and demanded more than 500 deaths, especially on the north side of the island.
Thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily destroyed on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for convictions of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Governor of Alaska and former candidates for the Office of Vice President, was arrested on the basis of accusations of the body violation.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of the suspicion of domestic violence, the disability of the report of domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, such a report published on Saturday by the police of Alaska.
According to the police report, he took off the phone to a friend when he wanted to communicate with the police.
Palin, according to KTUU, is investigating in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a deposit of $500 was collected.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he was asked for his Pleedoyer with "not guilty, very sure," so the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three order violations of class A, which can be charged with up to a year prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a orderlessness of class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that penalties were raised against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is negotiated at the time before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disability of the reporting of a crime and arms possession in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend asked him to beat her in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organisations in 2016 after her son's behavior was reverted to a post-traumatic stress disorder due to his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that the Indonesian island of Sulawesi shook on Friday.
The earthquake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been interrupted and it is assumed that the number of dead will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake happened shortly before the coast of Central Sulawesis, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave met on the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the Tsunami met on the coast.
Bundesanwaltschaft demands rare death penalty for suspects in New York terrorist attack
The federal attorney in New York demands the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the terrorist attack of New York City, who cost eight lives. This is a rare penalty that has been no longer imposed on a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the construction market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, in the course of which he rushed on a bicycle route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, while passing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the accusers must prove that Saipov killed the eight ovens "trusted" and added serious physical injuries, as stated in the statement of intention for the claim of death penalty lodged in the southern part of New York.
Both charges could be punished by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Supreme Court, Saipov, presented a claim in 22 points, covering eight claims of the murder against the background of organized crime, which is normally used by state lawyers in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires "basic planning and purpose", said the accusers, which described the way in which Saipov did the action as "absurd, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and losses," said the explanation.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
Since over a decade, the southern district of New York has no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was guilty of murder to two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to a life-long sentence of freedom in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York in a federal crime, in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been guilty of conspiracy for spying for the Soviet Union two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, witnessed in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, so court documents.
He told us to feel good with what he did, so the police.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to do after he had looked at videos of ISIS on his phone, so the accusation.
According to police information, he also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public federal defendants representing Saipov, said that they were “unclearly disappointed” because of the decision of the prosecutorship.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty will only extend the trauma that all the parties suffer, rather than a debt in exchange for a life-long sentence of liberty without the possibility of release," said Patton.
Saipov's defendant team had asked the charge not to claim the death penalty.
A representative of the Conservative Party calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore to mobilise "the power of the people" today during a protest action at the Tories Conference.
The former party leader of Ukip said that politicians must “feel the pressure” of the Eurosceptics, while a Member of Theresa May's Party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative rear banker Peter Bone explained to the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be “ready out” if Farage Brexit minister would be.
The challenge facing May in reconciliation of its deeply disrupted parts was strengthened by the participation of members of your party who are for a stay in the EU in a separate demonstration against Brexit held in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems with maintaining its Chequers compromise plan despite attacks by the Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies argued that despite the counterreactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Euroscepticians and the oppositional Labour Party to decide between their package and the 'Chaos'.
Bone explained at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers are on the waste’.
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed to a Peer and had given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he was responsible for that, we would already be outside,’ he explained.
The member of Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the waste.’
He emphasized his opposition to the EU: ‘We have not fought in wars to be undermined.
We want to make our own laws in our own land.’
Bone rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is totally wrong.’
The Brexit advocate of the conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and explained: ‘I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and in our activists who actually walk through the streets and make sure we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a peculiar message to May, she continued: ‘President ministers keep their jobs when you keep their promises.’
Farage stated in a speech that politicians must “feel pressure,” they should just be deceiving the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class’, says Farage.
‘They try to deceive Brexit, and therefore we are here today to say to them: ‘You are not coming from it.’
Before an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to feel the pressure of our political class, which is shortly before betraying Brexit.
‘We mobilise the power of the people of this country, which helps us to victory in the Referendum and will never come to rest as long as we are not an independent, self - managing, proud United Kingdom.’
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour announcement in the city centre.
A few activists swing banners of the Tories Against Brexit grouping, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had safety problems with a party app during the opening of the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland’ Adonis.
‘This is a Farce.
There is simply not the good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to ‘prove precisely’ presidential candidate
U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren explained that after the elections in November, she would “examine the presidential candidate.”
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats talked about their future on Saturday at a meeting with electors in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a pronounced critic of President Donald Trump, is just in the race for the re-election of the Senate against the Republican Members in the Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was Vice Chairman of Trump's election team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the center of speculations that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been its 36th meeting with electors in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's arrival.
One of the persons present asked her if you wanted to candidate for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top."
Arrest after death grants on LSU player Sims
The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on LSU Basketball player Wayde Sims from Friday in case of fatal shoots.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference to arrest the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. East Time.
They had published a video of shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to see on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot near the Campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shot injury on the head and died as a result of this injury," according to the sports media portal 247 sports by police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday the media.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to have been at the place of deceit and possession of a weapon and shot on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any other incidents and was held in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two meters of Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 start-ups in the last season and was able to record an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great Prize of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after his team left the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in Qualifying on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Stallorder of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost as he suggested Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the rider field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went to the box a round later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton persuaded him after a little bike-to-rad manoeuvre, where the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inner side, with the risk to endure after two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen began on one of the behind squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round on place seven.
He was then for a large part of the fastest race, as he kept on his tyres to finish quickly and pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally went in the 44th round into the box and didn't make it a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished as the fourth.
It was a difficult day, since Valtteri has done an excellent performance all weekend and how a true gentleman has acted when he should leave me over.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump was funny at a electoral campaign on Senator Dianne Feinstein, who persisted that Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which they prevailed to the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, not to have passed on to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford’s statement did not address directly before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that the Senate’s proceedings show that people are “common, vicious and dishonest.”
"One thing that could happen and the miraculous thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate is when one sees the anger when one sees people who are angry and mad and wicked and unholy," said the President.
“When you look at the leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Publish the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Should I send her away?
I didn't publish it."
Okay, please.
We have it... No, we haven't published it," he added by imitating the voice of the senator.
Feinstein was awarded the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was published early September. However, Feinstein argued that the leak was from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," said Feinstein according to The Hill's information to the Committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret, and I spoke to her request for secret."
Her dementi did not seem to come well to the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election campaign: “I tell you one, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defense of the Judge Candidate, which was provoked by three women, the Democrats claimed that the accusations would be used for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power with all means.
One sees the community, the evil, they don't care about who they hurt when they are betrayed to get power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer won two gates for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat again good on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 win in the back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants went to tour early with two gates, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made the compensation for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of Giants.
Francois Bouchard looked like Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two gates.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who killed Dundee on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, while the giant won the three previous parties.
Dwyer's opening gate took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation of Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the presentation when Beauvillier developed the leadership.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie half his compensatory gate after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the leadership of Giants before the mid-term break when he reached his second gate of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team was re-grouped and Bouchard was re-established with a Power-Play-Treffer in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen to lead Dundee late in the second half of the game for the first time. Nielsen then secured his team victory with a fifth gate after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home the next Friday at the Milton Keynes Stadium.
Aerodromes died after he made sure that hundreds of people in an aircraft escaped the earthquake
A flight lock in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death to make a plane with hundreds of people safely started on board.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong postages are still to be felt in the region and many people are trapped in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your lives, the 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his posts in the strongly varying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to be sure that the flight of Batik Air, which was on the start track at the time, was safe.
Then he jumped out of the Tower when he thought he was collapsing.
Aversion later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson of the Indonesian Aviation Security Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“ We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital to another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand. The country’s disaster protection authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to rise, as many bodies are still under the ruins, while others cannot be achieved," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesperson.
Waves with up to 6 meters of height have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new hospital comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross hurries to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia’s president Joko Wido arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech before the country’s military: “I ask you to work all day and night to do all the tasks that are involved in evacuation.
Since you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia has already been shocked by earthquakes in Lombok this year, with over 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports about a missile after aeroplane crash in lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports of a missing one after it first claimed that all 47 passengers and crews were safely evacuated from the falling plane.
Air Niugini explained in a communication that they can't say anything about the stay of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced to work with the local authorities, hospitals and intermediaries to find the man.
The airline did not answer immediately on requests to more details about the passenger, such as his age or its nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water when attempting to land at the Chuk Island Airport.
Officials said that seven people had to be brought to a hospital.
The airline indicated that on Saturday six passengers were in the hospital but were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact expiry of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the railway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was flying over the railway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was very flat.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wake through cheerful water to the emergency exits on the sides of the falling plane.
He said that the flight crew was panic and shouted and he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who worked close to improving a plant site hurried with an inflatable boat to help people to get to the coast before the plane sank deep water in about 30 meters (100 feet).
The data of the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 people have died in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them had Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the expiry of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charge closed her evidence in the renewal of a case where a man was accused of banning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett spent hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers on the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers, in which he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford came to witness on Saturday and said that he hadn't been in the city that day.
When the accusers asked if Tellis had said the truth when he said that night to be in Sanford's pick-up, Sandford said that he had lied, "that my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers at their death time two weeks.
But cell phone recordings pointed out that they knew themselves a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis had some time after Chamber's death their messages, calls and contact information released from his cell phone.
"He removed them from his life," said Hale.
The defense is expected to start their Pleedoyers on Sunday.
The Judge assumes that the procedure will then go before the jury this day.

Another black one?
New York children's girl complains couple for a release to 'rassistic' texts
A New York children's girl accuses a couple of a discriminatory release after having received a misleading message from the mother in which he complained that she was “now a black one.”
The couple contradicted to be racist and compared the dispute with a 'depression'.
The two-fold mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her contamination when she found out that the new day mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when it arrived her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEENE, NOCH A SWARCE," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice. Two times.
After acknowledging her Fauxpas, the Plasco-Flaxman Maurice released her "peoplely touched" and claimed that the open-up afro-American daily mother had done bad work and she had expected a Philippine instead, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with an uber.
Now Maurice accuses the couple of compensation for the release and claims compensation for the $350 per day, which she should have been charged for over six months, for which the job for which it was originally booked, but without contract, and for which it would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, that's not what you do," she said on Friday, "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the racism accusations and argued that the release was the reasonable step, as they feared Maurice after they had offended them to no longer be able to trust.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not a racist," said husband Joel Plasco of the Post.
“But would you trust your children with a person who was innocent to them, even if it was forgotten?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the dispute with a "depression" and explained that his wife expects a baby in just two months and is "in a difficult situation".
“Do you want such a person to be interested?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the dispute continues, the couple was quickly condemned in the public and provoked to the social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a speaking beer reveal a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: “It is hard to put into someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our today's knowledge of Paddington's enormous success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, his work would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death last year was “bitter sweet”.
She explained that your father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she describes as a "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and didn't spoil," said Jankel.
“ But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if you have a child who is doing something special: you are proud, even if it was not really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although he found it and created it, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to take her over the phone
After the country, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save their lives in vain.
“Nad called regularly to say that it really looks bad and that the doctors gave her little chances," says Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to adopt her.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that gave her the doctors to keep her heart on pumping slowly sounded down and left her body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything except waiting while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry, as I was in a situation surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was grieving about the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers who didn't know what she was through on board the plane.
"Nobody knew it," she told.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over the cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women hang on cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost relatives by a suicide are trying to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up on a bridge in Wales cards with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting places.
Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel as I feel every day,” she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was facing a promising career as a cook and he had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could light up a room."
However, he announced his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's body was found by his then 11-year-old brother after the suicide.
Davis said: "I always fear that this could have a consequence."
Davis designed the cards to “show people that there are people to whom you can go and to whom you can talk, even if it is a friend.
Don't keep quiet: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years together, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed," she explained.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was on the low point. When the children packed out their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that it had to go through: “There is a huge hole in the family.
It breaks us.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Board Kavanaugh's future in the swab while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought if we could actually get something that he asked, that is, a timely and limited investigation, we might get a little agreement," said Flake on Saturday, and he feared that the Committee in the party-political absent would be "breaking out".
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Your rebellion can be brought back to the timing alone.
The intermediate elections on 6 November are only five weeks away. If the Republicans are badly cut off as expected, then they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush took the phone listener to call senators and convinced them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate in which currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide on equality and to confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of Korean overflowers “sinkt” under Kim
The number of North Korean overflowers to South Korea has fallen into power since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, such as a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who recalls data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that last year 1127 overflowers were registered compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as main factors.
Pjöngjang did not speak publicly.
The predominant majority of crossings from the north are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul notes that since the end of the Korea War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the overflowers rather illegal immigrants than refugees and often leads them back with violence.
The relations between the north and the south, which are still technically in the state of war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of the State met in Pjöngjang on talks that were about the denuclearization negotiations.
As a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, in which they agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without trusting in the US, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, it is impossible for us to open up one-sidedly," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for the Office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the Nancy Pelosi Representative House called judge candidates Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said that he was characterized by the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t reject the impression that a woman who had acted so would have been called ‘hysterically’," said Pelosi about her reaction to the statement of Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh demented in an emotional way all accusations that he had abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he cried almost and stood in tears shortly before, when he spoke of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him a "great and coordinated murder" organised by liberals who were angry with Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court, as she showed that he had been prejudiced to democrats.
"I believe that he has declared himself unequivocally with these statements and the way he went about the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to withdraw Kavanaugh from the Office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judgement posts," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently Judge at the Bundesberufungsgericht in Washington D.C.
Pelosi continued to say that she was as a democratic concern about possible decisions Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion basis decision Roe v. Wade as he is estimated as a conservative judge.
In his hearings Kavanaugh asked whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We don't need a hysterical, prejudiced person who goes to this court and expects us to say, 'Ach is not wonderful'," said Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hatred speech, months and years of overcooking anger and she won't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped by a woman who was somewhere manager and said that she also wept when she becomes angry, but has developed a technology. If she gets angry and begins to cry, tell her to the person she said to: “You may think it's sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she's just talking on.
I found that great."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are perfectly misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories is to a former job, in a office dominated by men, where one day I wept because of an indescribable anger and was moved to a staircase by an older woman, an undercooled manager, before I was always a little afraid.
"Let them never see you cry," she told me.
“You don’t know you're stinky.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with themselves, as they believe you have gone in the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congress Deputy from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship named Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then returned to his candidateship, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidate.
"This was not a well thoughtful decision," she told me 30 years later with a laughter.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation: ‘Sweet whites and the seven dwarfs’.
Since the campaign had already progressed, it was at the back of the funding and it sweared not to be a candidate if it had not to get $2 million together.
It was an unseen fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who donated men $1000, only supported their campaign with $250.
"Because they believe I get a discount?" she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to start an official campaign, she was so difficult by her emotions, thankful for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the media creation and direct addressing of the voters instead of the delegates, as well as the anger over sexualism, so that it was close to tears.
"You could have assumed that I suffered a nerve break," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the pocket manufacturer Kleenex had been my sponsor.
I remember asking myself what they would write on my gravestone.
"She wept"?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the USA and China
The opening salves of the trade war between the USA and China were oring. Although the battle is not over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a grave between the countries in the long term, my experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, fired the first warnshot at the beginning of the year when he imposed important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with penalty duties.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new penalties on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all imported goods from China to the US.
Beijing fell back in the same way every time and recently raised penalty rates of five to ten percent to American goods worth $60 billion.
China has sworn to answer any US action and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon crash.
To move Washington to the penetration, it would mean to repay. However, a public inknicking against the USA would be too tasty for China's president Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries either in Washington or Beijing is much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized," says Abigail Grace, a scientist who focuses on Asia in the Denkfabrik Center for New American Security.

There was a time today tomorrow when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything from it.
Get off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players made a good performance.
We'll regroup, I'll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll look forward.
