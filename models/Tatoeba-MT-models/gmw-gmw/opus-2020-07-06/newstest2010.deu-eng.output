Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
U.S. President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to accept the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the Norwegian metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he first meets with the five members of the committee who chose him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
Afterwards, the presidential couple planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony, where Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He receives these as the fourth US President, but only as the third who takes the price directly in office.
The White House has already acknowledged that Obama will talk about Afghanistan war when taking the price.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking over the price as a President who is currently leading war in two countries.
He has strengthened war effort a few days ago by sending other troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgot to highlight.
In the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the cheque over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to spend for beneficial purposes, but he has not yet decided about a specific karitative work.
The event programme then provides a banquet with the President and his wife, where, except for Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and other 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant to the prize from the beginning.
He said, for example, that he felt that he didn't deserve the price.
He also repeated several times that the price is not only for him, but for all who seek the same values as he did.
Immediately after the announcement, he noted that this is "require for action" for him.
Nature protector is accused of expression
The Leitmeritz Police accused the Chairman of the Civil Association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for expression.
In several cases, he made an appeal against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals, he asked the investors for money for his benefit, said the Leitmeritz Police Speaker, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaft, Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in jail and it threatens him a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste containers in Brünn do not smell well
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the Southern Morocco villages you will find again on step and step the sorting waste containers.
And in Brn?
There you would have to book a few minutes to find the appropriate waste tons.
I don't want to say that the separation of waste in Brünn wouldn't work at all.
But I think it is not enough for the Council to take care of this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics, but above all by the number of garbage tonnes for such waste.
Did they try to dispose of the PET bottles in a collective basket sometime in the center?
This is just art, before all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found to be random until now is the footsteps against the struck gans.
Mr. Unterka should not be angry with his colleagues, but this is too little to me.
In addition to the fact that the separation of waste in other parts is not a honey leak.
That's why my friends would rather not sort the waste at all.
From faulty.
It's too far for them to the garbage tonnes.
I'm not surprised.
I offered some glass and plastic bottles even after the celebration.
But on the Konicova road, I have not seen any color waste tones in sight.
Fortunately, I got to the right position on the roadway.
But the garbage was almost over.
This is still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics are likely to leave the Brenners socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city a ice hockeyliga that makes us shame throughout the Republic, instead of buying a few garbage tonnes more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brown.
I am glad that I could also confirm my adoption with official statistics after I have been looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the EKO-KOM company, Brünn is really the worst in the whole district of southern United States.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the left party, despite the government's view, gave farmers and officials more money, there is no more money available in the budget for pensions, sick money and construction savings.
But neither for the government debt or for the international court disputes.
This causes more problems that will be at the government in the second half of the next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists have enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expect the government to pay the money for the sensitive expenses, pensions or the sick money. "This is just a breakdown of the problems in the future, to lay mines," says Janota.
The loans pay more and more interest, and you have to reimburse the money sometime.
Too much to choose from where to take, the state casse is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the State holding are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the firearm, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
To get the pensions or the sick money, whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't have to be afraid, they get this money.
But by the price that the State is even more indebted - the next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the State case, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and, together with them, the costs and interest rates.
The State will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce maternity money, as the government made in its area-efficiency package.
Due to the reduction of money in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing for the development of motorways and railways next year.
It is mainly the sections gained in competition, which can no longer be reprojected and possibly approved.
At most, what is not free of charge.
This means a shift or abandonment of thirty large buildings, also at risk of Europe's production, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it dissolves the flow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ shareholders in which the State is the owner of Majority, and then the money is paid out in the transport fund.
The problem is that the height of the dividend is never sure and it is not an infinite source.
In the previous year, 18 billion CEZ fled into the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, fill the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the Nieveau of 5.7% GDP according to the EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the conversions yet.
Almost three billion were cut down the budget for various compensation for victims of Communism and criminal offences or expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the State gets right without that money is not sure.
That's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister must then save the money inside or attack the government budget reserve in the worst case.
One hundred million are also missing for the already started twomilliard project "State Case" that will allow on-line to monitor what the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future with a phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single key.
The plans presented are promising.
It's enough to press only one key, and from Windows Mobile will change Android within few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to imagine, focusing on the development of the virtual software for computers.
We enable you to run two user profiles at the same time on the phone.
You can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallelly, explained Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented a few days ago for the first time.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalist.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which simultaneously the mentioned systems ran Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full.
Now VMware is working together with European and American operators on smartphone virtualising and the customer is supposed to come to the equipment within 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains the hotel owners harass
Scneeless slopes are not only worried about the giant mountains.
The lack of snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That's why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates incl. Christmas and Silvester.
Our pages are often visited.
People are passing through the offers, fixing the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas festival will be on snow or "on matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, quoted.
Anyone who wants the Silvester stay in the spindle mill according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Whoever prefers saving and where the quality of stay is only second place, who can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the Silvester Day.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they will have to give up, and go in for shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura appreciated.
Free beds at all winter dates always offers the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the Travel Office of Ingtour, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvester Day in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi Travel Office, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales will also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates will be sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes have been cut off within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Shaded.
Reversely and slightly better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizon in Pecpod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better than in the previous year.
On the Silvester Day and for Christmas we have only a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80 percent for the Silvester stay, the Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, half of the beds remain free.
Appreciatively, this year of January, for which we are already occupied at about 60 percent.
A little weaker is now February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains is certainly increasing, led by the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The giant mountain hotel owners are waiting for a larger snow coverage.
On Thursday it should cool down, and if it comes to rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But thereafter, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Recurrence is Mother of Cleverness
It is almost weird with which pupilsman Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the clause, repeated the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he himself thought the damnest.
When he finally swept out his long - expecting Afghanistan doctrine, it showed that he wrote it about the copy paper from the Busch-Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only that in the text itself he uses the mode of speech "as in Iraq" several times, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forward path", without being sauded.
Three years ago, he criticized Bush-Idee - fresh troop quotas in Iraq plagued by the Civil War - as "unresponsible and in their successive karastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the only possible and very successful Bush strategy, which was based on military recommendations, was that today the news about Iraq no longer speaks.
The call Bushs was not improved, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle is repeated.
To increase the contingent of the troops, he again asked the military, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite subordinating habits, hardly criticized the scourging protectors in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to be able to turn the situation back to better.
The President hesitated three months, but did not come to a better idea, so he deceived the General of whom by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he expressed the commitment for another 5,000, even though he originally expected at least 10,000.
Highly problematic with the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctor leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the semi-development will bring the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Even despite the brother war in recent years, the Iraq society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contra-indication - no one can rely on and no agreements will be held.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces who are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they have been formally properly founded, remain only shining buildings that will continue to provoke patriarchal tribal relations.
The balance of interest between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the inconscientiousness of the conditions which further complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "handling state" which is the minimalistic goal of the whole operation.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy alienated by his voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and now it is at the edge of explosion.
This believes that the small soldiers who have broke out in the war cry about the "early return" can create a miracle here only create a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the deduction of troops is purely unresponsibly because the Taliban will accept it as the indirect consent of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is nigh.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain to their electors how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukus region.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the stronger sanctions do not affect Iranians, the United States has a very difficult question whether the problem should not be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period during which America reaches Obama for the victory withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only comforter for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential election, so it remains enough time to take a different strategy, if it would prove to be a total failure.
The managers of Bank Goldman Sachs no longer get premiumboni in bar
The leading executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premiumboni in cash this year.
This has announced that the company responded to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, but it is only possible to sell in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from managers in the case if they are excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, is thus at the top of the efforts to connect the premieboni of Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the continuing direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, quoted.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs was the target of criticism after she had put almost 17 billion dollars for premiumboni for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of the premiumboni during this yeara will probably also exceed $20 billion after the Reuters Agency, despite the measure presented today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the most hotest political issue at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, the UK reported that it intends to charge the coins of the bankers that exceed 25,000 pounds once with a 50 percent tax.
Similar steps also prepare France.
This year women have won the Nobel Prizes in all departments, except in physics.
Five record wives today have taken the nobel prices in the categories and literature in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian department, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her countryman Jack Szostak for research in the chromoson area.
The price for chemistry has been received by the Israelin Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the information of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last laureatin gave the Nobel Prize for Economy, which American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a nobel prize this year was physics.
Today, the scientists Charles Kao carried out this price for research in the glass fiber area and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, nobel medal and certificate of the acquisition of the money price.
It is 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money price is divided into it.
Traditionally, the U.S. President, Barak Obama, has received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he recognized the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path, and also stands at the top of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in respect of his policy, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the fighting of world peace, even if the price is high for it.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who thinks about his stays in the government on Friday, because he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form as it was released by the Deputy Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remain of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budgetary law, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the links party proposals for money conversion and increased the money for the public officials, for the maintenance of social services and direct wages for farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democrats that it covers the budgetary deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute has arisen, which is why the question mark on the further work of the fishing official cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in spring.
Criticians claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of savings measures carried out by the fishermen's government in autumn, which is intended to end state debt after its understanding.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the State budget but does not have to, today at the early part of the discussion with the entrepreneurs, said that politicians have neglected the "ernstige problem", which represents "the unstainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
He thinks there is no longer a good solution today.
Improvement could only lead to a strong government which could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, said that the budget is gray, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party is obviously no longer working.
Premier Fischer referred to similar words as "strong expressions" in the editorial action.
The CSSD Chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek's words that the Etat Deficit is gray that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD rated the approval of the State budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unslaped" of the world shows much of the country, its struggle and victory, despite some criticisms, that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, races and Nelson Mandela.
The intimate fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story of the American Oscar shoe player, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the nineteen-year-old Mandela if he could present him in the Eastwood film.
Another significant role takes Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I need to meet you.
The two-seventy-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the box area "Million Dollar Baby" already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which has become a slave holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan All Might", but rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for his active activity in terminating apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set freely in 1990 and he became president of the country for four years.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unpleased", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film describes a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the captain of the South African Rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to agree the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racial and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can match his people through sport, so he decides to agree the rubbians who are among the outsiders around the world.
Finally, the South African team rises up to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role so to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said, if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat with him at night and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela his hand.
I found out when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, she's being transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
For me it is important to become another person.
Matt Damon represents in the film François Pienaar, Captain of the National Rugby Team, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I sounded at the door ring that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'In the film I look much bigger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the statue of the actors compared to their actual models, under the leadership of the director Eastwood, "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" received positive reviews and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good history, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Dissolved light secrets about Norway: The Russians have tested a rocket
A particular light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only admitted yesterday that a intercontinental ballistic rocket was tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful again and the type "Bulava" called rocket, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the premiere, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the Rakete test also had no positive effect on the success of the sample flights.
Bulava has usually not started at all or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, it is already written about "Bulava" as a "Rakete that doesn't flee".
A rocket that doesn't flee but shines
This already 13th attempt, was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight there were technical damage to the rocket.
The engine probably exploded at the third rocket level.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atom U boat Dmitry Donskij, which was under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket enables the shot from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northways was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
This time, Generality has kept itself on the other hand and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was done without error, the management of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore complies with the generality with optimism and is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atmospheric heads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual agreement with the CSKA Moscow at 51 years
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov represents itself in a professional ice hockey game at 51 years.
The former world champion, Olympiager and Stanley Cup captain are helping his team CSKA Moscow in the need, and probably already attacks KHL in Fridays Doll against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career for 40 years, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the Agency quoted the Coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other fellow players, led up co-player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice area, he becomes after AP the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game.
In the NHL, the legendary stormer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with fifty years and was able to benefit 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic Gold Medaillen, seven world championship titles, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gathered successes in the NHL, where he put the Stanley Cup twice over his head in Detroit.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the ice hockey star room.
Hyundai resigned to trade unions. All overtimes are lifted up
The management of the Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
Due to often ordered overtime, the union announced the strike willingness on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speaker of the Hyundai automotive factory, Petr Vanek.
The management, however, wants to agree with the trade unions about a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19th, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working layers would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday layer.
The staff will also receive the Saturdays of November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the surplus or they can take substitute leave on December 28th and thus extend Christmas holidays, Vanek performed.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday layer are paid the driving money and lunch.
With regard to the fact that the overtimes were the most urgent and burning point of demands and complaints of the trade unions who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtimes for the month of December, Vaněk reported.
The employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work almost every day after eight hours.
With the signing of the agreement, strike will revoke the willingness of trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions are expected to be reached on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfillment of the demands and sign a joint document, they are willing to lift the strike willingness.
The location in the automotive factory has been spited last week on Wednesday when about 400 employees spontaneously stretched for continuous overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged skicans.
On the other hand, the management held that employees must make overtimes to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The trade unions also demanded that no sanctions be made for the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions demand to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they are calling for the payment of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was launched in November last year.
Until this September, about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with ́s counted ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds that aim to undermine the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to medicines.
This fact prevails against the disadvantage that the connection to normal virus variants does not work as much as one of the existing medicines.
The disease of AIDS cannot be healed yet.
However, the patient can extend the medication composition and prevent the increase in HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus prolongation has also resulted in the development of resistant viruses against which no medicines are more effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from Heidelberg University opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalokarborans act on the protein that is responsible for increasing the HIV virus.
Metalokarborans are compounds of boar, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus reproduction in a way other than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come to new 'improved' compounds that have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus eggs.
The metalokarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two versatile cages consisting of boar, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Heavenly and persistent virus
HIV protease is protease of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus sharing caused by HIV protease, there would be no mature infection virus particles.
When we turn off HIV protease, we also disable the increase of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Scientific Magazine Journal of Medicine Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further changed.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances on HIV protease words tested in the reagent glass, also against their persistent (resistent) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalokarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicinal products, but does not lose its effect on the resistant variants of which the medicines used are often without effectiveness.
The unique efficiency mechanism, as well as its further characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of other chemical designs, makes the metalokarborans interesting links for further research aimed at developing effective medicinal products against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, director of the laboratorium for structural biology of the Institutes for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fighting about budget. ODS went on to fishermen, who resisted
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "grey" and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The statement of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "star expressions".
It's supposed to be time for analysis.
The Deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it is the fight against the increasing deficit, or whether it is his survival in the office by means of Parliament's links.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problems of public deficits is dimensionary, and Necas has pointed out.
Parliament adopted the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, but with link-party amendments over more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for public officials, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has prevented the social democrats' proposals from exploring the budgetary deficit.
Czech Republic should manage with a residue of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has fulfilled the wish of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budgetary project. Frase not clear
Disillusionment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, talked about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government is still assessing the present situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his withdrawal to the case that the amendments would be adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech television, Janota has registered for Monday after the government business at the Prime Minister.
He indicated that he was considering his further stay in the office.
The reason for this is his disappointment about the dismantling of the budget.
As far as fishermen are concerned for the further fight with the budget deficit, according to Necas, nominants of the Social Democrats (CSSD) who had made the changes in the budget have nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt more deficit laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions, or the law of service.
Topolanek: The Ministers nominated by ODS did not irritate
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministers nobled by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, in a deputy position, people who confess themselves to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to stop fighting against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-hand majority currently in Parliament".
Then he is supposed to be unable to expect the support and tolerance of the civilian Democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and if this is going to happen, I'm going to focus on it, the Minister of Defense, Martin Bartak, nominated by the Civil Democrats, told the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council to Brussels.
The ODS returned on the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote in favour of the amended budget on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister would explicitly ask the Delegates of the Civil Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not appear as orphanage children, we are not small children, then he responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party president in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice my voice would be missing.
Even when I abandoned the mandate, I knew that it would be positive in the next few months mainly about the Bolshevikization of Parliament and destruction, Topolanek responded.
According to the new map of the CD (Czech Railway) less trains will drive about the same price.
The Czech railways end or restrict a few less-lasted fast and local trains from 13 December, while other connections are strengthened.
The whole traffic range is reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new schedule compared to today.
Most of the prices incl. base and customer travel tickets are not changed.
Several connections to the capital, for example, receive the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway sets trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The quick train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also be driven on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections will be reduced from Prague to Letohrad.
The largest reduction plans the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, on the other hand, can look forward to an increase in Prague and the surroundings.
Two night trains are also lifted on Prague - Tabor - Budweis and to a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, and the inhabitants of Milovice have to turn around in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth roadway of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electricity from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distance trails to the capital will end at the main train station Prague.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will travel at the time of two hours.
With the pendolino, the passengers have no longer been able to drive to Bratislava since December 13th.
This year's account for regional railways: increase by 200 million
The speed trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, as a whole the railway receives for the balance of the so-called liquidity loss in the next year four billion crowns, just as this year. The local trains provide the districts, as a whole, pay eight billion crowns for that next year, with the State shooting three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains as well as fast trains, the railway has completed a 10-year contract until now the contract has been completed for only one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps it has not taken the price increase in the large majority of the tickets.
Changes are only available for one-day network tickets CD Net and for cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the driven stick until now he was united for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Millitante takes more than 50 people, the children were released.
Today, millions of people in the south of the Philippines were kidnapping 75 people, including some primary students and their teachers.
This has led to the AFP Agency, which originally only informed over 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children held were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
In the Province of Agusan del Sur, there was a defeat in the province of Agusan.
About 19 million were supposed to use the hostages as a living sign when they escaped the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to produce the rest of the hostages.
According to the AFP Agency, the millions belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the Province of Maguindanao, the law was imposed on the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, which was associated with the election in the Governor Office, were 30 journalists.
Due to the suspicion of participation in the massacre, the Governor of this Southern Philippine Province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan-Clan was arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But those who have resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippinian government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinema "Invictus: the unslaughter" which includes a part of the history of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against the apartheid has received Morgan Freeman, who was said to have been elected by Mandela himself augee a few years ago.
The adjoining role of the legendary South African Champions in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
The cinema start of the film also makes reactions by critics and the public loud.
Nelson Mandela
He is named Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sacchar Prize, then in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to the cinemas in a time when, on the one hand, in South Africa culminates the preparations for the World Championship, but at the same time the media shaken world publicity with fearful news about the growing racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruled majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are very positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that, as you say, I can receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can get on the personality of Mandelas and his message with this movie.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every human being, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the booksheet of British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people united, the South African defender of human rights portrays within his first presidential election period.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman tries to bring together two groups of races and each year, and, like Nelson Mandela, in 1995, he also takes part in the South African National Rugby World Cup, which then won South Africa.
For the entry into the dress, which is almost a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped large ovations fourteen years ago, predominantly from the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may perform it to join the people together again to one people, led to the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the National Team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, that will only be shown.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, such as in recent interview for LN of Rugby-Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Great Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
Burn transformers for several 10 million crowns in the Louny area
The fire broke out at the transformer of the company Ceps in the circuit system at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
In the fire, according to the speaker of the Usti nad Labem District Fire, Luke Marvan, took six units.
Originally the fire gun wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is deleted with a mixture of water - foam and special extinctions.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer interior closure.
No one was injured, the Havarie did not endanger the security operation of the management system according to the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated to be several 10 million crowns, more precisely, the damage will only be paid after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, there has been nothing similar with the company Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, complemented.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokesperson of CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, by the fire of the trafostation was not influenced the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is active in the Czech area as a single operator of the management system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switches with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into distribution system and lines with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura raises criminal indication for blasphemy against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal insults against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Morocco, Radko Martinek from Pardubice District and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The action depends on the company's efforts to operate regional tractors in some districts.
All regions, however, finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the rosins, we have only presented the offer over the scope as it had been agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railway because we would know the prices of the Czech railway that were completed last week.
So nothing else is left to us but to defend us.
As a result of this distress of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radiojournal.
At the same time, he suggested that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with the European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the investigation of the penalty to continue the medial show of Jancura, which serves him as a free advertising for his company as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also ask for further leaders.
I suppose that even in this matter it will become clear that it is Jancura, who manipulates the public in the matter of regional traffic and uses lying and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he invested several million crowns in advertising that will point to the detrimental step.
He told the Radiojournal that he interrupted the campaign after Christmas, and he wants to continue after New Year.
He stated that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign initiated Jancura, after the districts agreed with the Czech railways in operation, and no tenders were made for the contract in a high crown of 150 billion.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of train transport in the districts, according to Jancura, he also threatened a member of the CSD.
The only threat was if we do not stop losing the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jancura said to the Radiojournal today.
vaccination against pneumococs free and voluntary
Invasion against pneumococs changes the habit as of January.
It is supposed to be the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But votes are already reporting that the mandatory implementation would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococs.
The pharmaceutical institution already defines the maximum prices of vaccines to pay health insurance.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
vaccines free of charge for August children
As of January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococs born on August 2 and later.
The condition st that they have not received a dose of vaccination yet.
Anyone who has started vaccination last year or earlier has to pay further recovery vaccination itself.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Previous year, one quarter of the families had impfed their children against pneumococs.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
As a whole, experts estimate that health insurance spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year.
But they save in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all the children's surface ineminations.
The mandatory implementation was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococs cause mediocre inflammation, but also severe infections including brain skin inflammations and blood poisoning.
By pneumococic infections, we die in hospitals a year after study up to 28 children aged up to 10 years of age.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory implementation of children against pneumococs was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time it is said that this vaccination could be a duty in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid and voluntary by the insurance companies.
That the mandatory implementation would be better mentioned, for example, the head of the Civil Association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has already been working for Pneumococ Impact in the long term.
The experts at the international conference, at which our association was involved, were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have succeeded in implementing at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococs.
At this moment, we don't consider that at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The Chairman of the Faculty of Practical Children's Doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, you could think about reducing the number of repetitions "In a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary," said Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to impair their infants against pneumococs from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococs is also a breakthrough that it is paid as the first area reduction by health insurance and not by the State.
Insurances should spend the money for prevention to save them for further treatment, cursed Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this involves anxiety of the practical children's doctors in purchasing vaccines.
After the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and the doctors then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members feared that insurances could "execute money from health insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurers pay them.
According to the estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
That won't be easy at all, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son involved in "Museum Diebstahl"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars from the museum of his father.
According to Pennsylvania's police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was captured in his vehicle when he was invited 90 paintings.
It means that Frank Frazetta junior and another man would have used a bagger to penetrate into the museum into the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his representation of shapes such as Conan of the Barbar and Tarzan.
Associated Press reported that the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family party.
The Agency reported that, according to a political ease statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father, "that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all paintings into a camp".
The Agency informed that Frank Frazetta Senior contends to have granted any permission.
Labour defends Etat and Tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of opposition, economy and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have allowed an opportunity to "squeeze" to show that he seriously meant the reduction of the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.
The Treasury Chancellor also warned that he was targeting low and medium-sized income for workers.
Its main proposals include an increase of 0.5% in social security and a 1% limit on public wage accounts for 2011.
Social security workers
The trade unions, on the other hand, protested that low wage recipients are punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned against upcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - to about 3 billion UK pounds per year - has angry the private economy, saying that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year, will cover about 10 million workers.
SHIPPUNCTION OF THE PREPARATIONAL ETAT REPORT
Increasing social security by 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50 % tax on banking bonuses
1 % increase in corporation tax for small enterprises rejected
Tax disadvantages for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increasing State pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by €90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be poorer by £ 190, while a person with £ 10,000 annual income will be richer by £ 110.
The Ministers said that their objective of deficit reduction by 2013 meant "sufficiency decisions", but they also said that 60% of the charges of additional taxes would be deprived of the 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argues that the described tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"That are large numbers, they will bring us the deficit halfing and this is also necessary over the next four years," he informed the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's predictions on future economic growth – which influences the extent of re-debtedness and the speed of deficit contraction – were questioned after the treasurer was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy will probably shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the decline by 3.5% predicted in April - while the debt would be higher than estimated before.
"Passed Occasion"
The conservatives who want to start a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against the "Schuldenkrise" of Labour said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is inaccessible.
They added that the Ministers have failed to present a credible plan, how they will pay back this and press "cynical" before difficult decisions until after the election, which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"You didn't say anything about what they're going to do," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them go."
"The important announcements are made only after the choice, whoever wins it."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour continues to keep schools, hospitals and police from future reductions, unlike the proposals of the conservatives, which see the deficit capabilities coming faster and more.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money obtained by the tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argued that the plans were "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalidity pensions in April – the Treasury Chancellor would suspend the accusation of voting because the money could just be recovered in the next year.
Labour continues to provide extra assistance when people need it the most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Hold Etat"
Although the Ministers have not announced any Etat details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognised Institute of Tax Examinations said that the figures of the Treasury Chancellor would mean strong breakdowns in many areas, perhaps also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defense.
"It just shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins it," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to the business auditor Deloitte.
"This was only the hollow pre-etat report. The markets recognize this."
FBI examines "Festions of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI examines the arrest of five US citizens reported because of the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab Province, and the American Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said that it is examined whether the same men are, the last month in the U.S. state of Virginia were reported as missing.
The U.S. Department said that they were also looking for information about men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistanian origin, one is Egyptian origin, and the other has a Jemenite background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the accusations that are being put before them and under which circumstances they are held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said that the authority was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistan authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani message in Washington told that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house and that no charges were submitted against the arrested men yet.
The Reuters News Agency reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the USA must work together with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.
The five students were reported as missing by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "Misquery" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, it is still as bad about human rights in Iran as in the past 20 years.
The report detailed the "misuse pattern" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report indicated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of his human rights balance.
Official bodies said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedschad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and killed dozens, leading to the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Thousands of prison sentences and accusers said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, now located in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak River.
But since then there has been no more tolerance from the authorities for criticism, said our correspondent.
"False Consent"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year computer student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of the "work with Facebook networks" and of the protest against the election results.
"They often struck me into the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in the neck, on my head, and they threatened me with death and they reduced me."
After five days, he signed a false consent and became, still bleeding and half conscious, released on the street, Amnesty informed.
The slaughtered presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and raped others.
The Iranian authorities denied rape, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been held in a prison in Kahrizak with 75 others more than eight weeks in a container.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the courts had established a committee which should examine the distress after the election and the reactions of the government, but Amnesty, the mandates and the powers of these institutions, and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees, had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 persons were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform a true sign in Bristol into a competition piste.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders fighting for money prices.
On the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jumping chant at the beginning of a 100 meters long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the summit of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shin underneath.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders of the country here - some right talents."
Prices were granted for the best pieces of art performed on the slope or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Swiss elector voted for a ban on minarette and the concern about the alleged islamization of Europe widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-considered and well-reasoned report about whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most explicitly secularized societies of Europe — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book of admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French do not love heads" (Original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumenting study of a dispute question that shared and employed the country over the other half decades, and whose effects are still to be perceived today.
Bowen's newest book offers a wider and cooler spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes now offering the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most disturbing.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town house (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permitted for a Muslim to use a zinc-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
They are these seemingly profane matters, he claims that the daily life is, in contrast to the political dramas that the media are engaged.
The author recognizes a new generation of imamen, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, possibly except Tarik Ramadan, a Arab-Muslim scholar born in Switzerland and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have all arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists, who interviewed Bowen, are mostly unequivocal with their Salafi matches – fighters of purist sunnic Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims today.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a more rude treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews who had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "destructiveness of value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most controversial view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice they characterize melts with alarming speed and takes life with itself that can nowhere else survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their throat waters.
Richard Ellis, a author and illustrator, writes in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural story of the icons of the north, the ice bear.
In the complex history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting on the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson encountered with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old feather to the lake, which only fought with the gun of his muskets, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught when they swam behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought into zoos and circuss.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears in an imagination.
Even today, zoo plants still typically have a millionth of the life range of a wild-life old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The ice bear in Singapore was completely green by the algae that grows in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although forbidden in Norway, America and Russia, the establishment in Greenland and Canada continues where hunters in helicopters and motor slide-driven Inuit use powerful storm guns to drive their probe.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and alarming description of the science of the Arctics and a packing insight on how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all answers.
Neither atmosphere scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
But this is not due to a lack of explanation attempts.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century were the first time to announce the confusion of the package.
In the Cold War, underseas boats avoid the moving grace while undergoing.
A useful supplement are satellite measurements and the large-scale delivery of measuring dishes on icebergs, but many are still achieved by unfrightened people who camp outside the cold.
Anderson throws a look into the strange, tiny world of the flow system within the Arctic ice formed by salt waterrinn halls that are pressed together during freezing.
But, starting from beer on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice goes away, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... we could be."
Marine infanterists were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington cranes
The upper freed De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to put a single crane on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine infanterists who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Peace Court in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they entered.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the burial producer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves on the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition and Morrill, and his wife Karen, who each year undertakes this journey, continues along the way in various cities to conduct events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worceters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (cranes throughout America), which also extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16.000 cranes on the graves on the Millennium Friedhof, in areas on the Pentagon, on graves of the Fayetteville National Court in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the Memorial for United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than 150,000 dollars for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the journey to Arlington in memory of her husband, a dead professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is their way to return to those who brought the sacrifices.
She said that's a little bit of how we can support civilians our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers crossed the vast grasslands and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as a goal, as they are not often visited as the younger tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was joyful, children played and couples kept on their hand while carrying the fresh pine branches to the grey tombstones.
Each round crown was dark green with a small red loop that was attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends kept on each other in the ice air.
Some read out the names melted in stone, while others bowed down to small black-white space cards that had been placed in the moist mud, whose grave stones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who forgot bitter tears before the tomb of her son.
She traveled 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infrastructure Subofficier David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been anymore for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. government contractors arrested Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. with its seat in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USAID, U.S.A. for international development and for the World Bank.
Consular officials of the US representative of interest in Havana are trying to access the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The special charges have not yet been published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything under the accusation of the "angeration".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Government enemy Graffiti and statements are considered to be serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the Castro Bruder in Cuba and the Obama government, which sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The message of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy values that the United States will achieve a counterparty when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average earning of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are used to send text messages since a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily pay.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and some government sites, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Too many websites are limited to access.
On Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting behind grids because of crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the U.S. interest representative in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and imprisonment are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently produced a hard report on freedom in Cuba, entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", a presentation to Raul Castro as the leader of the country who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within one day.
He said that probably every solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistanian government representatives cover plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy that aimed to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist candidates who seek the Internet for radical young men.
Investigators said that they had been looking for a transparent rebellious, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had made comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet video page YouTube.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy for the immigration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inconsistent mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge place.
They were considered to be part of a covered operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that men were not discouraged in any way and still tried to receive the right recommendations to access the Al-Kaida chargers when they were arrested by the Pakistani criminal executive authorities.
The case of the five men - which are still in Pakistan and are interviewed by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the candidates in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more, in the decision who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret service has made it the highest urgency to place human active posts within Al Kaida.
The candidates of the organization are acting as guardians who do not let those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
American wishers recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Kaida, said analytics.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered as extremely attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, ranked analysts of the NEFA founding based in the US, said that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years in view of whom they have allowed access, because the US secret services have become experts of their recruitment methods.
If one tries to put someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the Bella Congress Centre of the City of Künhner's Climate Protection Act.
Demonstrants said that 100.000 people had joined the event, whereas the police estimates were more likely to be about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists blew small explosives near some government buildings in the city centre.
One day, when little happened in the UN climate negotiations, thousands of activists wandered through the city with translucency, on which "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, photographer Helena Christianssen, who said that traveling to Peru, the country of her mother’s birth, would make her aware of what heartfelt problems the country has to face due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I decided to participate in the great demonstration - in order to forward the word and appeal to the world leaders, to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not a easy task, but it has to be done now and there's no longer a way that leads around it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from approaching too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstration.
According to a spectator who didn't want to be called because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing fired several explosive bodies near the main channel of Copenhagen, where there are several ministries near.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they began as a luminaire missile, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the congress center, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest seems to have not achieved the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's Chief Climate Retailer.
When asked if he thinks that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he answered in English: "This is something I wasn't even aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the place of event is large, I can't hear what happens outside."
He found that it depends on the perspective of individuals whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the public and various sectors on climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturbed the negotiations or freedom of other people".
Examination data show hard-necked racial air
The evidence of mathematics performance was welcomed good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the schools of the country, which produces the highest performances, the testimonies show that the fourth and eighteen clauses have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
What, however, is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the hard-necked performance gap between Afro-American and white students, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average number of white four-speakers from Washington D. C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress made by the Afro-American eightcells remained in principle the same, it fell by a statistically neglectable point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white pupils was not included in the test data as the sample was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated White and Black Fourth Claussler in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that children have reached both groups has grown during this period, the difference with now 58 points has barely decreased.
Some educational advocates of the district expressed their concern last week that the results that were celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty have been promoted most of the white students who are still powerful children.
This suggests that we have raised the overall evaluation by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, Executive Board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that enters for education equality in Washington D.C.
I don't jump up and down for a break of two or three points, said the Democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton basic school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the test point numbers is that the city's middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what fears me is that we do not spend almost the time and energy we have to use for our middle school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weakened students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading plan, the Wilson Reading System, which aims at pupils in the upper classes of primary and secondary schools, which basic skills of reading have not been mastered at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their equally mature classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, which focuses on games from kindergarten to sixth class and life-skilled experiences, was brought to Washington under the former leading school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progresses reported last week.
I think that we must continue to work to benefit the best measures from students under the level of notes, Rhee said.
Others say that NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and can continue to provide the additional money and resources for the poor schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, the urban examination results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could lead to political implications that work against this important agenda point.
The weakness is of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that she tries to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we establish a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the city districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year currently 180 days in Washington to compete with the charter schools.
You have to increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who last year with his teacher work came to an agreement over 185 days a year that he considered "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Education for more people than prospects for the future
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises out and shines a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facades and the smaragd green grass.
Gracielas parents have hardly completed the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was buried in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other eighteen clauses of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where teaching costs $38.690 per year, were rather one of a fearful visitors than one of the enthusiastic future students.
"Yes, here I will be soon!" called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtful when the low professor-to-student ratio of the school was reported.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th who the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully taken up the planned message: The question is not whether you go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the U.S. hispanese immigrants who do not end the high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college training that is necessary to climb to the middle layer.
In fact, one of the five of these "two generations" of Hispano Americans concludes the college – which is a remarkable performance, as many of their immigrated parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the USA without having completed the high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workers.
Those who examine powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for the school and a indigenous drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of confidentiality with American schools.
But advice programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
If you look at income weak children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in searching through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supporting network for these children from preschool to high school.
The Bundesprogramm, which had financed Gracielas College Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - switching up a corridor - and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when indigenous students are in the middle school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped over 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction which started on Friday.
The only company that has issued a command has drawn the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The thinly seated representatives of American oil multitudes at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its gates after six years of war, and instead of US companies, Asian and European are presenting the way, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no other offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still underlined by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability by the deduction of the U.S. military, probably prevented American oil companies from engaged more in Iraq, which has the third largest proven raw oil reserves in the world.
U.S. companies were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies who could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and who have been assisting with technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors at two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the Great of the World Economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure with its partners and fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
In order to pay the Ministry's willingness to increase the emission of each field beyond the current level, bids were made for the prior bidding.
Top Planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In a obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan this week a top action planer of Al Kaida was supposed to have been killed, so representatives of the US terrorism fighting on Friday reported.
This would be the second fatal attack on a high person responsible for the terrorist organization in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistanian authorities, were supposed to have been killed by a number of missiles who met their car on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of Nord-Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They traveled in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said an official representative of a Pakistani civil secret service from Miran Shah by telephone.
Local residents who are suspicious to belong to the militants ran to the place and quickly took up everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US terrorism fighting led indefinite evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of the Al Kaida, which led terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies all over the world, noticed a leading official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate character of American air attacks on Pakistanian ground.
It also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe when taking its central role as given.
He accepted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and implemented them in operating plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that Somali had quickly risen in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and had best links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this does not reduce the danger he represented for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who had been killed since September when a similar attack was made by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the tribal area and three other topactivists.
The pace of attacks by drones of the CIA has declined from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website held by a non-profit organisation.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their attackability and, at the same time, killing intelligencers brutally in suspicion, the page reported.
Heading UN senders in Kabul will resign
On Friday, the leading messenger of the UN in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would withdraw from his office in March, thus terminating a stormy term of office which was deceived by claims of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eides departed when the Obama government has decided to send further 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN sender said that he was supporting the raising of troops, but he also expressed his concerns that the U.S. timetable for the military withdrawal, which is supposed to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilians to help in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The raising of troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civil side, he said.
Eide said that he did not lay down his office but only fulfill a agreement made to his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UNO-
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon now forward so that he has time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he better starts looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started searching for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has taken into consideration the Swedish-Italian-Stämmed Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Bagdad, and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously led UN peace operations.
Eides' position in Afghanistan was tested after his former alternate, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to hide evidence of massive conviction.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - which was fired - "the mission has undoubtedly damaged because a great measure of skepticism in relation to international interference in the election".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative in order to coordinate the aid measures of the American-guided forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to set up more staff from the United States and other western countries who donate for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the UN pollutants have undermined its ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I could only set up one person.
This is catastrophic and must not continue.
US Defense Minister Gates: Iran has to expect additional sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon rely on Iran's "significant additional sanctions" because he has not participated in discussions about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke on a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in Northernirak and declined the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he said as an answer to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which are indispensable to the war."
The Obama government considers a sanction package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect averageirans.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "the people are suffering from the sanctions".
On Friday, in an opinion of the White House spokesperson, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined European top politicians in the warning that Iran must expect "believable" consequences if it does not meet the requirements of the UN Security Council and its Atomic Monitoring Organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology is to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
In conversations in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that he would resume the discussions to restrict his nuclear programme and abolish a substantial part of his stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for his medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since that time -- partly experts say, because the Iranian leadership is unanimously obliged to commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran left the international community with regard to some proposals which they had already agreed at the beginning of October has, openly said, brought together the international community, including the Russians and Chineses, in a way as they were never in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31rd dec as a time limit for Iran to respond to these proposals before he will continue to follow other options, including those mentioned by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once as "depressive sanctions".
In a opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian representation of the United Nations condemned what they called "baseless and unfounded claims" on Thursday of some Security Council members on Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are willing to continue the conversations with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he fled to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and the division of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential of conflict in order to prevent delays in the US plans from reducing the U.S. force of troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to scatter the Kurdish concern about the upcoming troop deduction. US representatives quoted Gates to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We won't leave you."
A course change in the older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that held them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to talk more children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons have taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course and encouraged young couples to have more than one child because of the low birth rate and the older population in this summer, their answer was immediately and final: "No case".
We have already invested all our time and energy into a child.
For a second child there's nothing left, said Wang, 31, a personnel manager with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the Ein-Kind-Politics in China, which produced two generations of notorically thick, deported individual children, who are lovingly called "small emperor", a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when this policy entered into force, the UN
Department of Population Questions, while the number of populations of 60 years and older in 2020 is expected to rise from 16.7 percent of the population to 31,1 percent explosion-like by 2050. This is far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The inequality is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people made almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below a child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning co-mission, said that couples in a proven age have to get babies to "help reduce the ratio of the older population and reduce the shortage of labour in the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
Gradual relaxation
The country's constitution in 1978 enshrined, China's single-child policy is probably the most controversial available that has been introduced by the Communist rule until today.
Couples who violate this policy have to expect enormous money penalties - up to their three-fold annual salary in some regions - and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese representatives have attributed this policy to avoid the critical demand of natural national resources, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural areas, some officials who already had a child have forced to dismiss.
Many couples also had sexually secrecy abortions, which resulted in an unnatural high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards the Ein-Kind policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule – including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husbands and wife were single children – and in 2007 the sound of many hard slogans was healed.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example allowing couples to allow two children who are a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July, which started an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters who taught families to have only one child were almost overnight replaced by directives that describe in detail who comes to question for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out local staff and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not very encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disturbing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outer areas of Shanghai said that a retirement is to be identified in the requests of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
For example, in the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are still a month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be at about 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want to have children.
They want to give the best to her first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was legally allowed.
But they have, as many Chinese, only a small health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be irresponsible.
Humans in the West devaluate the one-child policy as a human rights question, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month with her first child.
Yes, you rob us the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their disgusting.
Wang, the personnel manager, said she wanted only a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to care for us.
We are not used to take care of others and do not really want to do this."
Chen Zeian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unblemished.
For parents from the middle level with double carrière, which decreases the birth rate, he said, it turns out to be successful and you need to be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
A single child, he said, also meets huge requirements for the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a lifetime for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to do this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of life, he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
UN Group drafts emission reduction plan
The UN Climate Conference, which has been promoted by wild poses and mutual accusations, has again set a focus on Friday with the publication of a document, which has been an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industry's nationen in the near future having to swallow the greatest burdens.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the control of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But he was considered important progress in a negotiation that is due to time, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by a UN working group specifically created for that purpose, is about the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries in order to avoid global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increase that the political decision-makers would contribute.
The process will give a great flexibility, says John Coequyt, leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the leading UN climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, referred to as "the great whole".
It shows the basic risk of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday an excitement by its assurance to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt the effects of climate change - from masters of floods and droughts to avoid deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks, which the discussions had decided in the last week.
The American Climate Specialist Todd Stern has rejected formulating that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not financed by industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China, as a representative of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the rise and action of larger emerging countries, so star, who also complained that the text is not far enough, will ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion one hour after the Chinese Vice-President He Yafei's statement that it was either lacking "the reason" or "highly unresponsible" to the leading American climate dealer that he said that the United States would not help China to master global warming at the beginning of the week.
By at stake with the future economic march direction of the great world powers, both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging countries have opened breaklines.
The current struggle is equally related to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, where China and the United States are concerned with their obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozens of influent countries would ignore the scientific necessity to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for who should bear the costs of braking the greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have taken more aggressive action to take account of the countries with very high greenhouse gas taxes for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic domination, according to Ulate, which is also a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries who are most exposed to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, even though the leading participants say that discussions will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members has presented a 24-page draft contract on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "exercises political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and require measures from emerging countries such as China and India.
The discussions received a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions must be clarified before the government leaders arrive in order to reach an agreement.
High-range representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice Minister, escaped their planes and rushes through the passages of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to dispose of Claims negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13.000 people go in and out daily at the congress centre, guitar-playing activists organise nightly shows in which they make fun of the countries they think betrayed and sell themselves, and contract designs are hand-by-hand instead of by e-mail -- are already a challenge.
The intensity just builds on: almost all major ministers are now here and from Wednesday 60 government leaders in Copenhagen will be.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Conservation International Organisation.
The heavy weights are coming.
United Kingdom's first 225 km/h faster train defines the mounting feeling new
Monday morning at 5 a.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce an admission ride that represents a revolution in the traffic in Great Britain.
The first high-speed pendulum train in the country will be reached 225 km/h at its lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and deposit 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will go on board the first Javelin Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new United Kingdom service will connect to an international rail network of faster, reliable trains and will connect the large balling areas of Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living pendulum cities, working hours would radically be reduced, and the change of aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road traffic.
In the theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds that are needed for the construction of a new national rail network could still draw the brake for the British high-speed glasses, the unavoidable planning slaughter and fears of environmental damage.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, will, according to the Times, submit the report on 30 December.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned level of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London to the West Midlands will pass with a space of five meters to urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the free terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, northward leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option is a y-shaped route guide in which a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would share in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel period between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 40 minutes to 2 hours.
The first subway, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with a little over an hour today.
The designs defeat the trains the possibility of driving at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters of trains with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be on the London-Birmingham route per hour.
This would, in turn, mean that in London a final station would be needed at which 20,000 travellers could be finished per hour.
Given the spatial restrictions in the capital, an existing railway station is expected to be extended to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be pursued or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures will mean that a final decision will be taken only after Parliament's elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains must first change from high-speed trains to existing railways in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be the travel period between London and Scotland at over three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive knacking point to ensure a change from the plane to the railway, a guide for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers come up for mortgage for 75,000 pound oranges of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading sub-home member of the conservatives, has charged the taxpayer a year thousands of pounds for the costs of an orangery that he is building in his home in his electoral circle.
The party's prison speaker who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that sub-house members have to live "of magnificent rations" has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to build an oak woodwork building at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The controllers of the sub-house approved the applications at that time, and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditure of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-house members, has a two-story house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining rooms, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control site of the underhouse, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he cultivated a winter garden called "Orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "Glashaus für Entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited by the Committee on Standards and Privilegia during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts to take an opinion on increased money collection.
Last month after an examination of its expenditure, the Committee freed it from the breakdown of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security of a mortgage over EUR 271.406 (300,000) from his London house to his district hall, which he bought in 1991, one year before his election to the Member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage interest by March last year.
In April his claims increased to over 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
Duncan's RBS mortgage interest rate has not changed during this period, which suggests that the total increase in the financing of the amount of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal steadless RBS mortgage rate decreased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the Subhaus show that Duncan continued to claim his property to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in May.
Duncan lost his post as the opposition leader of the subhouse in September after a Undercover reporter filmed him, when he said after the chance of spending, that parliamentary members would live "of magnificent rations".
"In essence, it means if you work for the state that you have to live with magnificent rations and how S***e is treated."
He said, "I have spent my money for my garden and have claimed a varied small part, measured by what belongs to him.
And I could have asked the whole fucking sum, but I don't do it."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil-gross trader, was attacked for his expenditure in May the first time, as it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he had explained with the Fees Office that this could be considered "as exaggerated demand".
One activist, as a protest in Duncans Rasen, has digged a hole in the form of a pound sign after it has become known that he had requested 4,000 pounds over three years.
When he was asked about the elevated mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved by the Fees Office as well as the following by Legg to increase value."
He added: "There is no debate on retirement and penetration or a compromise of rules or similar things.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer at all."
Come all your believers to admire Brighton's Beach Hut Advent Calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries by creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages with Christmas songs every December.
The event started on December 1 and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at free bulb wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dry fruits.
The until now selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary minister of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have taken several hundreds of arrests.
According to police, at least thirty thousand people, according to the organizers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could enter into force from 2013 until Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, increasing mobilisation in the world contributes to the climate, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, had broken windows with patch stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP found.
Anti-unrest police have taken in immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your opinion, were arrested mainly members "the Blacks Blocs", of this extremely violent splitter groups, already famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the East of France, in April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has held the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers were arrested "without distinction", sharply criticized, and has underlined that about a hundred of you were "never held in the streets on Saturday evening," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and insitting position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from the Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to be able to welcome the spokesmen for an evening with candlelight, taking part in the former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have arrived with bushes and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of you with sky-blue rainmashes, have made a first run in Copenhagen in the morning, as you have followed the call of the Earth's friends "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we go to the streets to demand a reconciliation of ecological debt in favour of the south, said Lidy Nacpil, philippinic activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue this way and say that we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, where you can walk, as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomatics, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
The European Member José Bové, formed by the critics of globalisation, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "cloak law and social justice", "Today there are no differences between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific area, where many islands are particularly threatened as a result of warming, has given the start of the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people went to the streets.
In Manila there were some hundreds of people, most of the students marched in red and hated bandanas where you celebrated sun energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, the excitement of several hundred demonstrators took place in order to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (South), in Lille (North), in Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abchasien has chosen his president, Georgia denounced that it is a "stroke".
Abchasien chose his president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian area as self-employed, Tbilissi denounced the "Streich".
Some 13.000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for the control of the South-Ossetian area, another Georgian secessionist area recognised by Russia.
The electoral sites have closed GMT at 17 a.m.
The election participation was about 58% a few hours before the electoral closure, according to the abchasian electoral commissioner.
The first premature results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abchasien is now under Russian total occupation, has explained his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world is perceived as part of Georgia, which is occupied by Russia.
After it had separated from Georgia during the 1992 - 1993 conflict, several thousands of people died, Abchasia wishes to prove that it is willing to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen for Herrn Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who chose to choose in a electoral location in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees before the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian president and the Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the eastern part of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the elections.
We, the Abchasian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an appointing to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abchasien's self-employment.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, and Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered a glass of Wodka.
The opposition on its part, represented by the former Vice President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements made with Moscow in the previous year, such as the one in Abchasien that has left Russia to control the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one voice is necessary to win the choice.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of elections must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to request an ambitious and binding treaty from the purchased climate conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, have arrested about 700 people at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, have demonstrated hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, in the afternoon halls in the Danish capital, which receives the delegates from 193 countries, which are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators have stopped about 500 meters from the center and have not tried to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the spokesmen for an evening with candlelight, taking part in the former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators who were completely dressed in black and were armed with bricks and with hammers began to beat discs, a journalist of the AFP found.
Anti-unrest policemen have immediately circled you and have taken care of by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police announced that 600 to 700 people were arrested and clarified that it was mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups, which have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the East of France, in April.
By evening, a policeman suffered an injury by a patch stone during the incidents where, according to police, about twenty people were arrested for a while, at the chin. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in control," said the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces crawled in the air.
Most demonstrators traveling by rail or by their own vehicle from German major cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue rain coat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "call image law".
"Today we go to the road to demand that ecological debts be repaid to the people of the South," said Activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say to ourselves, we have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that squeeze, there are water runs through which you can run, what was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation opponents has approached environmental organisations.
The French parliamentary and globalisation critic José Bové, said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer a difference between the fight against heating and the fight for another world today."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christiansen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific space, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to the warming of the earth, has given rise to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the terms of the organizers, about 50,000 people went to the road.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, have made recounts in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for sun energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered together in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organized by the 350 network, several hundred people joined together, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the West and Lyon in the East.
In Geneva, several people gathered.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycéen.
The National Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycéen, even though they are not obliged to be informed in the terminals (12th year of school).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have every four weeks and the same program," Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the Minister "must this shyness be overcome" because after him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but in the whole, a concentration of "the best pupil".
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) should not become a subprofile of science," he continued, saying: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals, who have disrupted themselves about the lack of historical and geographical education in the terminals on technical lyces."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) criticize the state project of the removal of mandatory teaching in history and geography in the Terminale S (12th year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also appealed to this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
On the other hand, the Minister replied that there was no question as to restrict the philosophy of the programme of the terminale S.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for protest against the project for Tuesday, which they believe will be the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister argued that at the beginning of the year, they were subject to a professional suitability test in Master 2 (M2) and at the end of the year of an authorisation test which examines their teaching capabilities.
In addition, they conduct internships in M2 during the year and then teach a year before the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued to say: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you will reach more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "a thing that does not exist in folk education."
He reaffirmed that he wanted to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge to deal with Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", on Saturday morning at Ecole Normale Suprerieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP found, the peace nobel prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Ernest conferences, where experts each turn to the audience with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach people and awaken in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students have given to fish in the bassin of the school.
"With the experts, around twenty participants were selected, even after their charisma," he explains.
"To climate warming you can speak for hours, but the core targets can also be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only freely with the help of films before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he pointed out in the hope that the listeners may find out that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos rotated by these conferences will be found online from 15 December on the side of the school.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will take place every two months afterwards.
Payment delay : angry prison guards, actions planned
The trade unions of criminal executive officials have called on Friday to a general day of action in order to achieve that the premiums and overtimes whose payment was suspended for budget reasons until January will be transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The second trade union of criminal executive officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire") asked the employees who have no service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday morning before the criminal executive body, in order to give attention to the "theft of what is to them".
The 3rd union of criminal executive officials ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called on "to unite itself to a strong mobilisation in the various prisons," on which the non-payment of the overtime, night surpluses and the Sunday and holiday surpluses in December is written as "shameful and inacceptable".
The first union of criminal executive officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called on "all mobilisations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The management of the executive body and the Ministry of Justice explained that the overtimes have risen strongly in 2009 and not all were planned in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims are paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice reported in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of the executive officers in which the payment is guaranteed next month.
"I know very well about the staff's efforts to maintain and modernise our criminal enforcement system," the Minister of Justice informed in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the criminal executive body to take action immediately so that such a situation, which has resulted from a lack of assessment of the overtime, will not be repeated in the future," added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore magnificent, except for the manager who enjoys high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "payment forces" must be held.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille embarrasses and announces "all congregations and calls" to boycott new instructions.
"The personnel do not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours of October are still not paid in December. This also applies to their overtime," also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"In a time when more and more tasks are enforced, without more staff being set up, the attempt to enrich the resources of the staff is more than inappropriate," said the CGT work of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is incorrect, the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he always distributes Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has plundered with the TV Talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he always distributes better gifts than he gets himself.
In a special broadcast that was broadcast over the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle showed how they will spend the holidays in her new illustrated home.
Even Bo, the little foursome companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog of course also receives a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband's claims for the quality of gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she necks the president.
"Isn't it?" he sworn her shelmishly and pointed out on the first lady's pearl chain, "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour radiation in an unavoidable atmosphere with the well-known television moderator Barack Obama had so much support during his election campaign, the President and his wife also talked about gifts that they loved as a child.
Barack Obama reminded himself of a bike with ten slopes and also of a basketball that his father, whom he had seen very rarely, had brought him to Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"First much later in my life, I understood that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady remembered her puppy house.
"I didn't even know how to order the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little popping house," Michelle Obama told.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL confirms that he was transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles because of significant "injuries" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation is "under control," although RTL confirms that the singer was transferred to the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday in the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors "Schädigungen aufgrund der Operation eines Bandscheibenfall", which he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, so his production company in Paris added that these damages would require a re-operation.
However, the singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and informed that a new medical opinion would be available at least 48 hours.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was moved into an artificial coma to avoid "bruises and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, there was a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
On demand of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" that after his first operation in Paris, "no drainage" was placed.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a band disk incident.
The surgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician who had already treated many stars, has been scheduled for several days.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's operation, the singer was sent to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a subsequent infection after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday on Thursday, felt that his friend was just going through a "deep valley", but he assured that you need "no worry" to make the rock musician because this is a "good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him that it was a foolish sense to sit into a plane twelve hours after such an operation, which doesn't go so," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reason to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was infected".
Mr Camus also said to have spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he did not feel a special concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer’s health has grown growing since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he had crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, the general astonishment spoke of Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer-OP", which led to a light infection.
At the end of September, the singer took his long "Tour 66" as a departure tour as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer had difficulty moving on stage.
Only in the middle of November, the surroundings had to dement a reap to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Curzbahn: First place for Bousquet over its favorite dance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, three-fold medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, took an international title on Thursday on his favorite dance, 50m free style, at the Euro-2009 on the short train in Istanbul.
On the first day of this contest, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m locations and the two others by Russia at 4 x 50m locations.
Shade for Bousquet, who wanted to take after the world record in the 50m free style, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
In one of the two king-distances in swimming, 50m-free style, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20,53 sec. at the start in a final with ten swimmers (usually it are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatians Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not succeed in breaking the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater, and in this case I said, when the world record is in my range, I'll try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epos in Istanbul, which started in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not been paid this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-fold world champion in the Becken this summer in Rome and World Record.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m free style (3:32.77), but with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and accomplished my task."
"Lobintsev will be a more serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Tomb at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tomb, which came up with the French writer Emil Zola, was estimated to be 1.5 million US dollars on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the III century after Christ and was always rated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysos are represented in a sophisticated architecture decor surrounded by Satyren and Bacchusfigures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday compared to the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is surely what the buyers have offered most for so far," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, to the AFP.
The discovery of this creation of the marble part by Emil Zola goes far back.
The plate was almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, and afterwards she dived pieces for pieces with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom with her Paris hotel and at Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III French Republic and President of the Council before Marschall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the database of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "Erbe of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the Fresko "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's trip from Honduras to Mexico has been defeated
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of doguran president Manuel Zelaya in the homeland as no longer compatible after this guided by the Putsch government had rejected it as inacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place in the night seems to indicate that one is unanimous with regard to the possibilities of implementing this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the immigration authority, the plane placed by the Mexican Government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelayas, was returned to its place of origin.
The Putsch government wanted to require M. Zelaya for "deliberate" and seek for him abroad for political asylum under leiding.
However, the crashed president refused to return to Mexico as a greeter, ambitious head of State.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a renewed failure by moving me to give up at my expense... they wanted me to despise," said M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, where he has often reported himself in word since the beginning of the political crisis that lasts five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and gladly ten years, here I have my guitar, the crashed President, who had fled into the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, adding some accords.
The Mexican message has submitted us a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept, since it does not include a request for asylum, and on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Putsch Government, explained to the doguran radio HRN.
I'm not looking for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible trip from Honduras, he had underlined, would only be the president of the doguran people.
The rumors for a trip M. Zelayas had mobilized the followers of the crashed president, who had come up to the Brazilian message and gathered around them, which the military there had strengthened its operation.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal nature of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been crashed on June 28, on the day of the folk survey organised by him to prepare his re-election, against the Council of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he was surprisingly returned on September 21, and had fled to the Brazilian message.
He leaves these, he is arrested for high betrayal, whom he is accused of by the justice, says the Putsch government.
The Putsch President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organise a presidential election on November 29 to dissolve M. Zelaya.
While Porfirio Lobo was recognised by the United States during the controversial election, the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentine or Brazil refused.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the expiry of his mandate on January 27th.
Wall Street in the upturn, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high level of the US trade balance of a course recovery of the United States' shares as well as its partners: the Dow Jones has added 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the stock exchange closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, which Nasdaq is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor’s 500 index was attributed to 1.102.35 points by 0.58% (6.40 points).
There are good news from different industries, Lindsey Piegza judged by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotically under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-full glasses", it relyed.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, the investors are primarily fixed on the figures of the American trade balance, "which have improved activity in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit of the United States has fallen by 7.6% in October to 32.9 billion dollars.
In contrast, the analysts had expected a deficit axis.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, reflecting the economic growth of the main trading partners in the United States, said Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment messages in the United States have risen against all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
In the last four weeks, however, the mean value of new work seekers was "falling to the depth of the year," Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors emphasized.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of public bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.432% from Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4.492% compared to 4.408% from the eve.
Cuba: hundreds of participants standing in power puffing "Damen in Weiss" from
Some hundreds of Cuban force-based participants have poured out the women gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day by political prisoners, and also a different denomination, which caused a good dozen dissidents to be temporarily arrested.
For the forty "Damen in Weiss", wives or near-standing political prisoners, they were poured on the open road of the government's participants under Raul Castro, just when they were on the footmarsch at the center of the Haupstadt to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Lower with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "the road belongs to the revolutionary!", "They live fidel and raul!", the authorized parties scanned the dissidents with a elevated faust.
The latter were shortened by civilian agents who appeared in order to "provide the protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Damen in Weiss" had played in Havana on the eve, where neither injured nor arrested.
On the other hand, a dozen dissidents in the Havann district of Vedado were temporarily arrested by civilian politicians, who also took place on Thursday's demonstration in the light of the International Day of Human Rights, confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents of the government's participants under violence to get into civil vehicles.
The temporary imprisonment of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As lawyers at the jurisprudent prices granted by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Damen in Weiss" organized an unauthorized approach for the "Please for the release of all political prisoners" whose number, according to the list of dissidents, represents around 200 people, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, from which there are 53 behind grids.
The Cuban authorities feel the opponents of the regime as "Söldner" or "Agents" in the service of the declared Architecture, the United States.
A rarity itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionary" on Thursday.
The Cuba guided by a unity party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused of European or American NGOs of ignoring rights and freedoms, especially of freedom of opinion.
Eighty-year-old kills with the knife and leaves 5 injuries in Clichy-la-Garenne
A armed mason killed a eighty-year-old injuries in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Friday by late afternoon.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had violated the eighty-year-olds from so far unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knifes and this, according to police information, under the presence of witnesses.
The old man born in 1929, according to a responsible police syndicate of Alliance in the hospital, is the consequence of his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he used a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the three-century, was injured and injured.
The first two victims were severely injured to the hospital, where the eighty - year - old died.
The other injured sweeps into risk of life, since, according to police sources, there were apparently vital organs affected by him.
The pregnant woman has become bad as a result of the events and she is supposed to have been hospitalized in a police source in the shock state.
The armed man, who seemed to be under alcohol or drug influence according to police information, is supposed to be left on the road, the similar boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have hurt two more passengers, apparently randomly: a trissig and a forty-year-old, with the latter of both heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives, which he crossed behind the back, said Arnaud Pressé, a responsible person of the Alliance syndicate of the area of Hauts-de-Seine.
According to the witness reports of theAFP, several passers, including young people, have tried to recount the mad people.
I saw a guy in the three-century with a green west.
Three young people tried to get in.
They couldn't do it because the guy was well built, Alberto reported, a cellar of a nearby bar.
A horde fell upon him, he added, including a city policeman who broke the wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the house number 61, two city policemen, including their chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with meshs, so police information.
The event has played in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main beats, where there is a number of shops.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought them into First Help Foundation and noticed a claping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about three-six-year-old person, was injured by cut wounds.
The forces of the State Police have finally arrested the man who did not carry a document.
The prosecutor of Nanterre has commissioned the district referral of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92).
The mad man was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In the light of his condition, he has not yet been taken judicially.
A police source doesn't suppose he's being delivered to a nervous hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to join him on the police police commissioner in Clichy, where he was taken off.
He was "in a state of excitement" like "all spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces are exempted during the tathergang".
USA: Polanskis Attorney calls for a renewal of criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polician Filmemacher Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to drop the prosecution against his clients, who is currently standing at his home in Switzerland due to a moral disturbance of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney of the director of the "Pianist", held a gross error in the negotiation period in 1977 before three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California.
I insisted on punishment, M. Hummel explained, before he added that the behaviour of judges Laurence Rittenband who were commissioned at the time of the trial "is running down a cold back."
According to him, the Judge Rittenband - now dead - had discussed before he fell his judgement with a prosecutor to tell him that Roman Polanski earned breeding house - which represents a serious error of proceedings.
This discussion was launched in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), especially by the questioned prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally explained at the end of September to have the authors of the documentary film "belogened".
If the Court refuses to suspend the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands the leadership of a process that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
On the other hand, the accused has repeated the evidence already explained in first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the offences raised to the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled from the US in 1978, before the proclamation of the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
Since that time, he hasn't traveled to the United States anymore.
The Deputy Prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski must be "to attend the negotiation".
Do you want to disseminate the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused who escape is a way out?, Mrs Asayma asks.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and despises his authority."
One of the three judges – which now have 90 days to make known their decision – even highlighted "that there were other cursives".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the imposition of law enforcement against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, again demanded the cancellation of the criminal procedure.
She reminded that her client would no longer endure being harassed by every resurgence of the Affaire Polanski and added: "Nobody in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Two-thirty years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, on the occasion of a U.S. detention warrant.
After spending two months behind grids, he was then sentenced to the house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in expectation of any extradition.
Wall Street is braked by the increase of the dollar and is terminated without course.
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Friday without course in a market between better indicators than in the United States and an increase in the dollar: The Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures present in closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has delivered 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Everything, the market is quite calm," Mace saw silver of Marblehead Asset Management found.
"He remains narrowly limited, the trade volume has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators as planned, which "have contributed to improving market views on the solidity of the recovery of the economy," the analytics of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the US, sales in retail trade increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months and far more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers has significantly improved in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the index was braked by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level over the euro for two months, which means that 'the sectors that are falling down for the economic situation', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost something on the ground.
The bond market has declined.
On Wednesday evening, the interest rate of the loan over 10 years has increased by 3.540% compared to 3.482% and that of the loan over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month rounding through South Africa, the 112 candidates will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to achieve their dream: to be elected to the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this before a billion.
During this large beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already lost their ticket to the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were cut to Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during her African stay.
This was a true trick of pleasures.
Beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, were simply extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and have made a lot of experience! said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition will take place in South Africa for the ninth time and will be transferred live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, at 1 p.m.
I couldn't imagine any more beautiful country to pass my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russians, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovering of "attractive landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, encounters with the press and Safari, the Miss is now focusing on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to enter the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, and to imitate Aishwarya Rai, which was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defilate in traditional traits and not to forget, in the bathing suit.
The idea is presented by a television moderator, the chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-groom king of South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a responsible member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is the world with a barely overbogging warmth and pride to receive white, insures Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, have made a Safari that visits famous township in Soweto, but this time, with the bicycle and the local cuisine.
But the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was very extraordinary.
Not common for a Head of State, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, is undoubtedly the release in Cape Town (South West) to the soccer world championship in June 2010, a kind of country, to recruit a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people that I'm probably never able to approach.
I will surely come back to the 2010 World Championship, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news to Johnny Hallyday are "Very positive"
The news to Johnny Hallyday are "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news are very positive.
He's very strong, it's all very good, David Hallyday explained the press on exit from the plane in which he arrived from Paris shortly after 13 o'clock of local time (21 o'clock).
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "fast" go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial episode infection after an operation at a band disk incident on 26 November.
The singer was "this night in Los Angeles put into an artificial coma to illuminate his strong pain and perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors of Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was delivered to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial subsequent infection after a band shelter surgery.
The singer had to resume a surgery in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the last illicit changes caused by the intervention.
His wife, Laeticia, took part in a school event on Friday morning at the French gymnasium of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade goes to school, found a photographer of the AFP.
The Chief of the Department of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has severely charged neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer in the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
We were told that he was making the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said that they were completely distrusted, said Mr. Camus.
I've heard that you might be going to introduce a court proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "is traveling much too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I have been calling with this doctor personally, who assured me that he sees this trip as totally unproblematic, which was very surprised to me, since I have two tape drives behind me myself, he added.
Shortly before he announced at RTL that the singer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the artist environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematom after a brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with doubtful reputation, who has already been sentenced several times because of ignorance and not to forget, because of tax deportation and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Board of Appeal, referred to him as "a man without scrupel", who has to be responsible "regularly" before the Board of Chambers and "everything else is recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave an explanation on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This said that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The surgery "proclaimed no bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have appeared in question since last summer.
It is clear that it is too short for a further tour on 8 January (in Amiens), said Mr Camus.
The UDF Party Association (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and urges the Nouveau Centre Party to stop using its seal
The party's association, which is supervised by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, has responded intensely on Friday to a seal attempt, once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the Chairman of the Nouveau Centre Party, Hervé Morin, and, under threat of a judicial persecution, asked him to no longer use this seal on a document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, since he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had reached the left hand.
Moreover, the Minister of Defense, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To emphasize his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now with NC), who claimed the property of the brand UDF, as he first requested this brand at the Institute national de la proprété industrial.
However, the business office of the UDF, which was monitored by François Bayrous' friends, broke silence and made it clear to understand that they were not allowed to escape and put a deadline to the Minister and to the honourable Member under threat of a judicial persecution, to stop using this seal and to transfer it the property rights of the brand.
During the last days, you have made numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement to take over the UDF seal +, wrote the party association in a letter signed by 19 of 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the Party MoDem and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Bündnis.
You probably also believed that you would have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the Slogan + of today's UDF +, on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF's business office explained and asked the NC Party to "remove the name UDF from all material as well as from (her) website."
In addition, Hervé de Charette "was required to transfer the property rights of the brand to their legal rights".
If you refuse this, we will appeal against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatory warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds us that Morin and his friends "have taken the choice" to leave this 2007 to create a competing movement, as had already been done by others in 2002 to form the "UMP" party.
According to the signatory, the Nouveau Centre has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la democracy française).
They continue to recall that the last UDF convention in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business office for defense "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the business office continues, "was he at the time when he applied the brand name for three years, no longer a member of the UDF" but the UMP.
He profits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of defeat of the acronym UDF in order to perform this for himself.
In addition, you consider that this inconscientiousness is the best way to turn into a crime and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us more in politics as well as in life to make ourselves a name rather than to try to get out of anonymity by making a name in a deceptive way that is not legal."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the Milliardary Liliane Bettencourt claims, he exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds in order to swallow up a part of their assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photographs, will have to be responsible for the exploitation of weakness in court on April 15 and 16th 2010, a criminal offence that is charged with a sentence of liberty of up to three years and a penalty of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this Affaire, which is worthy of the Saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter fetish themselves and at the same time have the tears of the cosmetic empire of L'OMontréal.
However, the 15th chamber ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly carried out by three doctors.
The Erbin and the main activist of L'OMontréal have so far refused to submit such an investigation, especially not under the conditions submitted during the investigation by Nanterre's Prosecutorship.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to present a report before 10 March 2010, in which you make clear whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have found itself in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these investigations.
I'll talk to her, said the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the negotiation.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady that you need to protect, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal action against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artists and accuses him of having exploited the weakness of her mother for years in order to erase donations from a total billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policy or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, which she sees as a long-term friend.
Although the court had to examine the permissibility of the action initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidoyers of the lawyers led to a large family deck on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Lilian Bettencourt called on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she dispatched to the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Lilian Bettencourt added the following: "Can you please explain to my daughter that I wrote to banier for fifteen years, one to two times a day.
Françoise I have never been able to speak since her marriage."
The prosecutor of Nanterre once again believes that the applicant had no right to respond in such a way, especially because in the last days a premudence judge rejected her request to initiate a judicial procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legally capable, is not under protection and has no formun.
No one has the right to act in its place," confirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to make a judgment after the process has taken place for the reliability of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic early education?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing...
Since over a decade, the position of the management of large enterprises in relation to its employees, the position of consumers vis-à-vis said before the marketing revolution: "values" for personnel are determined to depend on the best as it was previously designed on consumer products by the technicians in the work.
By giving the customer in the centre of the companies the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separately depend on customers' preferences again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA, or Renault are only the top of a much larger phenomenon that affects the employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of F&Eund, which is more crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) calls for "a proactive approach and a future-oriented view" by all the parties involved; it claims that the employees have a duty to contradict the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for an operational revolution that would consist in putting employees in the centre of the company's concerns equally in addition to the customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion
Will the internal issues of opinion, such as the questionnaire, which Orange has submitted his wage recipients, encourage this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, unfortunately.
- First of all, because I could find that, in the face of a new situation, after many reasons, the whole thing came to do first of all, what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportional to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Her interpretation of psychology is mechanically preceded by the large engineering schools.
By intellectual comfort, they take over the old behaviorist theory, which has recently been reactived by American "new sciences" and unawarely widespread by research institutes and by the media.
So and by suggesting that it is possible to operate the "Hebel" (sic) to engage in employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey published by Ipsos strengthens the executives in an attitude towards a mechanical control system that is inappropriate to the present world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, a operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of the modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It is to integrate a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of control: for the recipients, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve some of its dreams, their honor and their projects.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of the motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a specified Doxa that allows them to assess through their perceived image of the company what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and advance their "social performance" and place their human resource management at the right position.
Thus, they create a fertile soil that is beneficial for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama praise from right
On Friday, the American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama in Oslo on the eve and were satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 defended the concept of the "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who had ridiculed the allocation of the prize to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the president’s speech, following the example of the former Vice-Presidential candidate in the 2008 elections of Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today, adding that they themselves brought the theme of a "sometimes necessary" war in their memories just published.
Of course, the war is the last of which I think the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; a way of explaining his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, represented the opinion that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, this speech was quite historical, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio program "The Takeaway".
The previous Member, who is considered as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left", who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they could "not be free and do not have a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition to representing himself as a "cosmopolitan" how "he always does it," he "speaked like an American president" when he pointed out that the Europeans are living "as in a security bubble that they have not created themselves and they do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a falke of the era Bush, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "long-term, high-drive and inspirationless".
On the left of the president, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is worried about how Barack Obama defends the retirement of the forces.
When the war is packed under the cover of justice, the massacre of the innocent can be justified very easily, he warns.
However, the press of the gentle left continues to be praised by the President.
The Los Angeles Times, who still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, described the speech for a speaker like him, known for his talent, as "Monumentalwerk".
The speech in Oslo "provides a deadline for controlling international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," said the California daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and describes his speech as "different and exemplary at the same time".
Fernfahrer: Three Marathons for an agreement that ensures the provision for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the strike command and the threatening heavy supply pass to Christmas.
At the signature session on Friday evening, the State Secretary Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, welcomed the agreement initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second negotiation night, the negotiators separated themselves on the early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement in the late morning.
And that, although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 p.m. to the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was signed only at 18:00 p.m.
The conflict "has caused a lot of damage to the company" and "it was to be afraid that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transports).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages is therefore risen from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"This is not particularly much, but we first start small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now required to stop blocking the supply centres.
"There will probably always be some contradictions that are not satisfied with the agreement," he complements.
The TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "tough to allow these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase of 170 euros is monthly for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on healthy human understanding and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "an acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for the increase in travel costs by 3% and for the maintenance of the total road transport service in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable the 13th monthly content and the modernisation of tariff contracts to be addressed.
M. Bussereau recalled that "sinking of taxes for employers amounting to EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the Government to the 2009 Act of Corrected Finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday to Friday during the night.
The government calls for "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement first to apply to the companies associated with this organisation and then to apply to the entire status of employment in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time," assures Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association prescribed a "deceitful trade" because the EUR 100 million "was already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not to drift the Gans-Essers on the upcoming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement is threatening to "shoot a large grave to the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest highway network in France for the Grand Chamber of Paris and the Île-de-France, continued on weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration), which continues to wait strikes with their demands for wage payments.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central track (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central traction was only one of four trains used.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travelers to climb.
The shop shop chain of Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the large businesses to traffic technically".
The line RER A passes through the Paris Balling Area from west to east.
The RATP section combines the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains to the main traffic time was scheduled, and almost no one during the low time of traffic.
As already on Thursday, there was no human rage on the railways, as the residents of the Île-de-France had set up the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) had been far less than otherwise, especially because of the lack of gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), he said he would be extra "one and a half hours earlier raised to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to care for travellers by staff and order forces, pointed out that there had been no closeness in the Saint-Laazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or passed over the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metro.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers were again held, during which the results were reviewed which the associations had considered "two" after the meeting with the leadership point on Friday afternoon.
The RER leader proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line as regards all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they demand a long-term wage surcharge.
The CGT was embarrassed that the RATP itself puts its wage payment proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership point "is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a renewed meeting was planned for Monday for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "negates the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a Paris Committee.
Again, it was the leadership point, which until date refused any discussion during the strike, and pointed out a meeting after a restoration of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the line RER B after an announcement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations require a wage surcharge of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain the deterioration of working conditions on this route on which millions of travellers are travelling every day.
The drivers of the RER line, with years of professional experience, pay a gross wage of EUR 2.200 to 2.700 as well as a wage surcharge of EUR 600 to 650 for shift services as well as sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court resolves pro-Kurdish Party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party; a decision followed immediately by anger demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to tackle the work of the government, which strives to reach the hands of the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflict for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become a "station for activities that are disadvantaged to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", said the President of the Hasim Kiliç Constitutional Court four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been made unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to impose the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including the president Ahmet Türk and Parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political action for the period of five years.
In addition, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity that Turks and tugluk enjoy as well as the confiscation of the goods of the party.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the judgment that Parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than be a party-less parliamentarian.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP to follow the "Weisungen" of the Kurdistan Worker Party (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures "no link" to the PKK, however, refuses to designate it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The statement of judgment by the Constitutional Tribunal between the Government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish Community and to propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of Kurds in order to remove the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a relapse of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of the PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to conflicts with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators gathered before the premises of the DTP in the million city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The order forces used tear gas granates and waterlights when the demonstrators began to throw molotow cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the judgment, Türk assumed that the decision of the court would "develop the despair further".
"Turkey can't clarify this (Kurdish, i.e. editorial) question on the basis of a party's prohibition," he explained the press.
The government, consisting of a party resulting from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose from principle against the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," says Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpeding of the democratic opening that was promoted by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously make yourself focused on a response from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced a attack that three days earlier killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey, one of the most brutal attacks in the past months.
The snow break can come
This is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants to do.
Not because he wants to shake the citizens, the Winter Service Director of the FES says.
Especially so that his employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, it could be so far for the first time during the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is going to do this according to a precise plan.
As soon as there is surface-coating snow in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A tracks with large-streu vehicles will be exited, explains Brauburger.
These include main roads and roadways such as the New Road and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firearm accesses, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with casualties, such as the Atzelberg road.
The service of the FES begins at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be stretched in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better liable.
That is why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until professional traffic begins".
It's gonna be difficult if it's not cut at 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because no one is willing to make room for the scattering vehicles."
Only afterwards, if it doesn't go on, are donors and locking roads, including the Council Beil Street, on the row.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's footpopulation is on the way, danger points and transitions are first cleared.
For all cycling paths, the FES is usually unable to take care of.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps the bridges in mind from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
Since it is on this fast gloss, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, this is called by the police.
The Waves of Dinosauriers
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-freshing dinosaurs: The two meters long and 1.50 meters large animal ran on two strong back legs, had a long-length skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sekel claws and a long tail.
If the kind had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Science magazine of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was at that time in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relative relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began in 2006 with a burial on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaurier knock on one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis of Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they carried the remains of five individuals together.
Fund confirms theories about Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaurier fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly one finds only individual breaks."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
Especially spectacular, this fund is not, but he confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current teaching, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, so the allocation of these Ur-Dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the ices split into their three main development lines: the meat - eating theropods, the tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and the birds, the four-bodied saurropods and their relatives, and the plants fressing Ornithischia (Vogelbeckensauriers), for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
He shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacks, as well as the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, breathing the birds is more efficient than the mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spinal pillars were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant saurropods later also had air sacks and lightweight knives, the common experience of both groups probably brought about this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the primitivest dinosaurs lived in South America so far, the researchers argued that the Echsen appeared there for the first time.
Accordingly, the three development lines were early and spread from South America across all parts of the earth, which were still a single country mass as a supercontinent Pangaa.
For this, the fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot originate from a common, eminent ancestors, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-writer of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the Bonner paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted image, because in South America only a lot of primitive Dino fossils have been preserved, while there is little to find in other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominating landwirbelts of the earth's medieval age, it is still ridiculous.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and air auriers and with numerous other ecses.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relatives died from the Trias to the jura.
Success Story did not last forever
There are two hypothesis to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition from the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite strike of a group of animals was able to flower, which had also developed in the Trias, and since then had a shade drain: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signers are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto are the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Doctors from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The political relocation of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is a world-wide wave.
278 Professors and Teachers of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are united with the protesting students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, "absolute" they were the police use caused by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the educational strike last week because walls and works of art were shamed.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judged, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by a police command".
The rehabilitation represents a "not acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitimization and criminalisation of the protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau has withdrawn the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand the immediate attitude of criminal persecution.
The majority of the occupied people did not support the damage to the property, it says.
Protest legitimated
The youth of the Verdi union and the German unions' unions are also solidarizing themselves with the students.
The protest is legitimate expression of growing concern for your own future, says Verdi-Landesjugend Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hesse's Minister for Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of Uni-President and police.
We are grateful to the Uni-President.
Destruction and occupation are totally inacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbadener Landtag.
We have understanding of the protest, but no understanding of Vandalism, says the CDU Landtag Deputy Peter Beuth.
Otherwise it saw the opposition fractions SPD, Greens and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of discussing the arguments and demands of the students, it has been cleared.
The Left has submitted a request to the Minister of Interior to report on police use.
New Silicon Valley
She was considered secret city for many years, inaccessible for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded location for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow Centre, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had made contacts with the Frankfurt Science Location Riedberg - with the universities and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now signed Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt a "protocol for closer cooperation".
The Moscow Vice-Bürgermeister Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt Planning Decernant Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
The company of the FIZ is allowed to take foot on the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian science firms want to pass orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of significant Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electrical Technology, the major companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronica.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist planstadt" for armor research.
Selenograd (formerly translated "Green Town") received his name from the forested hillside landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremslotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be applied high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simple and simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the lowering of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will destroy the city of the bathing-worted mountain capital in healless building stations for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headquarters with tracks ending in the middle of the city were considered to be a 19th-century traffic fossils that worked like brake blocks of modern rail traffic, as it once took enormous amount of time to relaunch locomotives from the back to the front.
Driving, keeping a little short, driving on - so it's gonna go.
And therefore the headquarters should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located on half a route of the trans-European rail magnetism between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "Herz of Europe".
S21 is actually being addressed now, although the visions of the 1980s have long been no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost unpaid in the hessian and Bavarian capital to implement the deeper.
However, headquarters have no longer a problem of entry and exit since there are modern turning trains with motor vehicles and tax cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction route to Ulm is now being addressed.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway also involves the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project of the Republic of Taxpayers and not of the State Group.
The project can be somewhat justified by urban buildings.
There is a new urban area, which - one believes the computer-generated graphics of the planner - is equipped with a lot of green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The railway station and road expansion are intended for passenger transport, which, typically the 1980s, has a huge growth.
At that time there wasn't the competition of the cheap flyers.
However, modern transport policy must first be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as transport on the rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by trucks on the road.
But the new construction track does not suit for goods trains because of severe slopes.
Even much more grave is that S21 indirectly also tangles many other railway projects.
Good six billion euros are to be put into the swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is fixed that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and narrow points on the network.
A total of 60 larger projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the approximately 180 kilometers long route through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, it has been built on the trasse in the time-lupentempo.
Urgently necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake lock.
The Rhinetal Trail will be a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on the airport
The state government has left open in Wiesbadener Landtag, whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to review the VGH original of more than 400 pages legally, said Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written on this day that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in the case of the construction of the planned Northwest Landbahn in Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o’clock, as the state government suggests, should not be compatible with the legally required protection of the population against nightly air noise.
The coalition must decide until 4 January if it is against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized this upheaval and urged the representatives of the government to abandon a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group Chief Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise this should be considered as a "wortbruch".
It's fucking hard if you can keep his word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir in presentation on the FDP election log "We keep word".
Minister Posch resigned the accusation of Schäfer-Gumbel, attempting the state government to come to their night flights with "right twisting and trickstry".
A precise legal examination needs their time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal refusal, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As it represents the opposition, the statements of his group had never been forbidden to the night flight.
U.S. banks pay back help
The U.S. large-scale banks scattered their state bowls.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp Bank Recovery Fund to a sum of 45 billion dollars (about EUR 30 billion).
And the Citigroup also plans to reimburse state aid after a report by the US sender CNBC.
The institutions intend to complete the restrictions associated with the adoption of the money, such as the limitation in the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had made a good deal of $19 billion of fresh money for investors.
The rest of the sum took her out of her own box, which was well filled, among other things, by spare sales.
Bank Chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money sprite has helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the climax of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also intends to obtain money on the capital market for liberation from its liabilities to the State.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce a heavy increase of $20 billion in capital, CNBC reported in circles under appeal.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to express himself.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help in June.
Quick Choice
It went all faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Administration Council had forced the official editor Nikolaus Brender from the office, the sender can present a successor.
Last night, the Gremium wanted to vote on the personality.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender - officially to prevent the procedure.
However, a role should also have played to avoid further damage to the ZDF intent Mark Schäger, even this proposal should not be done by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 body members.
The result of the vote has not yet been established at the conclusion of this edition.
Two weeks ago, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, was failed in the Administrative Board.
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a defeat for butterfly, but anticipated.
Because the Union's majority in the Administrative Council had signalled weeks before the election to not confirm Brender in the office.
Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had organized the resistance to the chief editor.
With the argument that the ZDF's news broadcasts had lost on switching rates under Brender, he refused another term of office of the senior editor.
So far before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
Recently, even 35 national lawyers had intervened in the debate, which estimated the practice of Koch as unconstitutional.
It wasn't useful.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and romanism.
Afterwards he worked at the Southwest Radio and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey changed to ZDF, first to the "day-journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990, personal editor of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998, head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001, head of the ZDF foreign policy; since the head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional statement after the election of Brenders, which was still elected by the media magazine on Wednesday as journalist of the year.
Kochs Resirpart in the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Pfälzian Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the personnel's proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an exclusion of party politicians from the ZDF supervisory bodies also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended to the Board of Directors with a wise chess - by heavily criticizing the body right after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both guards without a loss of face for the head editor's posts and choose the Administrative Board without suspicion of taking a party person into office.
In the party arithmetics, Frey is attributed to the links liberals.
Studying is abandoned
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strike, the Ministers of Culture of the countries finally launched on Thursday: at a meeting of the Ministers of Culture and University of Rectors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to handle their studies in the future.
Individually, they agreed to reduce the test burdens: in principle, each study module is to complete only one test.
In addition, the workload of students is to be reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable measure" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of studies between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed to making common structures for Bachelor and Master studies more flexible.
There should be no other country regulations as far as they differ.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the ministers of Culture and Uni-rectors have been carrying the wing word of better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was first filled with a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to partially reduce the number of trials: "Each module usually concludes with only one test," says a 30-page paper that is intended to re-regulate the approval of courses.
With the "natural reduction of the audit burden," said the accreditation board chairman Reinhold Grimm, "food development should be required to stop that significantly affected studyability."
In addition, "study" will be "the crucial criterion" in the future.
Modules such as content should be "strongly reviewed", whether "unnecessary consents of students in the choice of
Events would avoid.
The students would have "demand to receive spaces that allow and promote own initiative".
The rules are intended to apply for the authorisation of new, but also for the review of existing studies.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which, however, means that it lasts until 2015 until all studies have been reviewed.
For this purpose, ten accreditation agencies are responsible throughout the Union under the accreditation Council set up by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture asked the countries in October "with emphasis" to influence the agencies so that the filling of substances is not too large and the test regime is not too strict.
In individual federal countries universities and universities have already dealt with the Ministry of State for appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate added resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
In particular, universities are aimed at setting up tutorial programmes and strengthening study advice as well as audit and foreign offices.
Country and universities want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a novel of the university law to Parliament.
After this, only one test should be required for the completion of a study model.
Study design is intended to be more flexible, to ensure recognition of performance evidence at other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
Until the end of the year, all studies of the country will be reviewed for their studyability.
Government and opposition had again contested the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso High School Groups called for the design of education policy to no longer take place "back closed doors" of the Ministers and university attorneys in the future.
At the latest, after the education strikes, the students as a concerned should now also "commit a word".
The future academics received support from the president of the University Advocate Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of Culture, with whom the HRK advised on a joint reform paper.
The union education and science (GEW) did not go far enough for the Bonner decisions as a whole: it demands a legal claim that each graduate with a Bachelor conclusion enables access to a further master study.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that enough master studies are available for the generation of Bachelor students today with best possible study conditions, says GEW Executive Board member Andreas Keller.
The countries need to make much more teachers.
However, the ministers of Culture did not express themselves to a more free access to the master.
More than one footnote on Herta Müller
Intake in Germany and out is almost no control..." is the initial line of a poem of the Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which these in disturbing language feasts address the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom but at the same time lost its language space.
Werner Söllner, born in the Romanian Banat in 1951, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded several literature prices, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetic lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
He made considerable extra literary attention last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in mirrors and mirrors of their securitate acts".
Söllner clearly disastrous and embarrassed a statement in which he was able to work against Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmut Frauendorfer, as an IM for Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendants, Söllner had received the German language price in 1989.
The application attempts would have started smoothly, first in 1971.
I'm, Söllner closed, "also someone who did not fight enough against intimidation attempts of the securitates."
The Lyriker Werner Söllner is a Walter.
Nearly at the same time with the nobel pricing for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literature scene and, in particular, the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case which identifies the abysses and the distress of a political system based on monitoring and conciliation.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say after previous knowledge, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his securitate acquaintance, Whaler played a role, said Söllner's confession of literature scientist Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of the IM Walter.
He "cracked him out" in all of the different points for him, says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this note.
Söllner's statement was in the form and before this audience unexpected, however, the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with Romanian secret service is not quite surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for securitate spits, Herta Müller had already written in July in time after reading its own record, 914 pages.
The affected, you may suspect, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and just Walter.
Unlike the very procedural vision of the Stasi-Acts in this country, the handling of the securitates monitoring is still very diffus.
A systematic information has been impeded and disabled in recent years.
One of the Birthler Authority’s national councils for the revision of the securitates (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, but since then the issue of the acts has been more slept.
Only since 2005 is there a law which regulates the management of the documents.
The fact that the influence of former securitate members in Romania is still very large, after the nobel prize for Herta Müller was announced in an interview, in which a former securitate chef from Temesvar was deprived of the prize winner.
She's got a psychosis. Finally, they've only been interrogated once.
The infamation of power meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Surely, the case of Söllner, as often in connection with silent debt, relates unavoidable questions.
Why only now? Who was damaged? The sunny response of listeners to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by knowledge than by debt allocation and shame.
To recover the work of Herta Müller, who took the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than one footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It works as if a adrett dressed outside servicer of a very nice Christmas celebration, on which a sports product manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the appliance, rose a quarter hour after midnight into a called C class.
The man with the marking glacier was able to chase himself because of the still foreign city he was.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol wasn't in the game, and the 55-year-old was just as little for happiness.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work goes on.
Or just get out of here.
In the words of the first three days before, Switzerlander: "We have reached the eighth final," namely, thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves hide from the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the degradation."
The "a lot more important task" stands ahead on Sunday.
Then it is true to repeat the king-class performance in Mainz in the league everyday life.
And the weaknesses reappeared again after the fast three gates through Marica (5.), Trash (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Exposure
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hingames 16./17. + 23./24 February/back games 9./10. + 16./17. March) is released in Nyon on December 18th.
So the joy of the fulminant state of the Babbel follower remained.
Not only by the supposed healer who had given self-confidence, willingness and enjoyment to the uninsured Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I went to the players and told them that they should think of their strengths, and I urged them to be more courageous, Soulklempner Gross explained the so simplely sounding success recipe, which had not been timened by therapist Babbel.
He has unfolded a certain magic, Babbel-advisor Jens Lehmann admitted, "if a new impulse comes in the football, things sometimes happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week-long break of injury through his dynamics, made the best player on the square, tried to describe the found "Phenomenon" with the pronounced "fresh wind" and the functioning of the new superior: "He is a man who takes through and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the present situation."
Under Babbel, it was obviously lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports board Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs, however, mainly constance.
Like Gross, players and managers were also observing to over-evaluate the victory against an overwhelming and overwhelming defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening, gave Khedira to consider.
And sports board Horst Heldt reminded that although a seasonal goal was reached, the other one was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that hero had not been present on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory for three months, was about the events of the weekend, which lived freshly in the form of a television interview of Torhüter Jens Lehmann, direct before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had demonstrated leadership weaknesses to the board and decided to change trainers on the pressure of pubertating fans.
Also that his free day had been deleted after games, Lehmann valued as signs of lack of sovereignty and guilt.
Lehmann's statements were "because of pure egoism", he turned back and announced consequences for the final man.
They're gonna be no more friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
However, they agreed with all the others that without the pre-working by the dissolved trainer team, the playful and fighting strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a great share in the success," Heldt and Lehmann unisono said - and the man also agreed with the plastic bags.
WM-Fight in heavy weight
Hitziges Duell in Bern: Frequently provoked editor Kevin Johnson Worldmaster Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight titles according to the WBC version.
The judge's judgment was unanimously rejected.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box world champion in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old champion after WBC's WBC's version in the night on Saturday in Bern defeated U.S. American Kevin Johnson unanimously according to points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainer was already two times World Champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work with the K.o. who all expected.
Klitschko built his balance sheet on 39 victories in 41 professional struggles, two times he had to be beaten on account of injuries.
Publisher Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
Around 17.000 spectators in the Berner Arena were about to dictate the fight with its left hand.
The eleven centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the clitchko era before the Duell, repeatedly dismissed the battles of the World Master, so that Klitschko could not make his dangerous rights a decisive goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a distributor and tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked clitschko with words and gestures, his beatings met the world champion only rarely.
After all, he is only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with clitschko.
Before the struggle in the Swiss capital, the publisher had provided for a number of wirbels.
He offended clitschko as a "hustle zombie" who "can't do anything right".
On Friday, the champion was provoked to push Johnson the sunshine from the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory to Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko was also victorious in his fourth battle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of age, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and had "his" WBC belts, which he had to give up without fight.
This year he forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the USA.
In this fight I only got a stroke and I am very good physically in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is a world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
The WBA's belt, however, bears the British David Haye, after it was able to throne the 2.13 meters of Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had abandoned a fight against Vitali Klitschko for September before in the summer.
Its promotion company already plans the fight against clitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin called Defense Minister Guttenberg for false information on the Kunduz affair as a Lügner.
SPD and Left require information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the recent insights on the air attack of Kunduz, Opposition Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor at Guttenberg (CSU) has undergone a conscious deception.
The Minister said to the fatal bombardment on two tank load trains from September "scientifully the intrusion," said Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It's commonly called it, he's lying.
The order to kill had been issued in the absence of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the NATO report that Mr Guttenberg had read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was known that the attack was not only about a destruction of the kidnapped slanders, but also about killing two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. air attack requested by the German Kunduz-Commantor, Oberst Klein, was killed or injured by up to 142 people, according to the Nato investigation report.
Green, SPD and Left on Saturday, Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) asked to express himself immediately before the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy and whether Chancellor Office, Federal Army and News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green Colegin Renate Künast demanded.
Government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm decisively rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's office did not influence concrete interventions of the Federal Army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the representation of the Ministry of the backgrounds of the release of general inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have informed correctly and fully about the backgrounds of the tank laser attack.
Officially, they had denied the existence of the Nato reports and reserved sensitive details to the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, they said that they had even pointed out several reports of the Ministry of Defense, including a two-sided document of the commanding chief Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert was supposed to have asked in a letter for clarification of the matter, reports the "Frankfurt General Sunday Times".
He hasn't received an answer so far, it says.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not comment on the accusation and pointed out that this was clarified in the Bundestag Inquiry Committee, which intends to constitute on Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images in awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only are the limits between imagination and reality weakened in psychic sickness and drug rush.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything's okay.
If we lie in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can give ourselves the most wild ideas and imagination.
But whoever experiences traumatic conditions, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, mostly in the modern Western world is considered crazy or drug addicted, at least as a special one.
However, such pictures and voices do not only arise in psychic sickness or in drug rush.
The same neuronal processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes ensure that the limits between dream, despair and reality are blurred.
Dream-likely modified wax-consciousness conditions can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case.
Even though triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystician Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age professor Carlos Castaneda, Shamanic Reduction Conditions, Psychosen and Halluzinations can be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or wraths arise when the balance of the neuronal messengers of the brain is disturbed, and the interaction of various parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and awesome thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no more power over him
The connection of Wahn and Dream has been engaged in philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristoteles understood hallucinations as a form of dream in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatrie, founded in 1861 a "great similarity of misbehaving with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all imperfections, whistle formations, sense disorders of such a thing".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and silent.
The gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the room deck.
He feels a step.
Behind him winged devils with blood red, distorted fractures, whispering.
They hunt him, step him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Sound, malicious voices drown from walls and radio.
He can't bear them anymore, the voices that mock him and offend him.
Henning T. gets two cables from the stereo system, knots them to a sleeve and fastens them on a hook on the ceiling.
He rises on a loudspeaker and puts the snail around the neck.
Jumps.
The snail dissolves.
That shall be a teaching to you, shout the voices in the drum felling choir, "go into the clinic and let you heal!"
Today, Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years back, the first nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is chizoafive paranoide psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, manie, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis, I have experienced worst anxiety and deepest despair, he says.
The trumpets are gray reality
Around one percent of the population suffers at least once in life from schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second-third disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, affected people are usually no longer able to distinguish between interior and outside worlds, they are administered in an overriding state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare.
The affected person can no longer be able to separate importantly from insignificant, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the sleeuses for a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper consciousness layers.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is subjected, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Oberarzt der Klinik für Allgemeine Psychiatrie in Heidelberg University Hospital.
The Schizophrene is located in the center of the event, everything has a significance to him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is overwhelmed by the events, like in the dream, and cannot actively make it.
Therefore, schizophrenes often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible to them, the trumpets are grievous reality, waking out.
Once in life a hallucination experienced
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but keeps the sensual and spatial structure of reality perceived in the psychosis in principle."
The absurd thoughts and hallucinations are found in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain hits capriolen, researchers still face puzzles.
Exemptions can lead to a short time loss of reality in every human being, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic allegation to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the solely defining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimum brain damage in the case of affected persons.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed in an early stage of development, for example by a mother’s virus disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery as the disorder of the neuronal system occurs, which, at first, does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Also, hallucinogenetic drugs can trigger psychosis because they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy one is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medications to get rid of them, others spend money for drugs to get those, says Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Box.
Whether drug images are felt pleasant or unpleasant is often only a question of the position.
Box has been collecting reports about hallucinations and trunks for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The irreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying appearances of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
These include psychic disorders such as borderline or depression often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer and skull hirntraumata.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to box, are composed of memory contents that are normally kept.
They arise when brain areas in which sense observations are processed are overactive or too low; if our brain runs hot or even if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also riding, stress, love cup or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents indicated that at least once in life hallucination had experienced.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gymnasium there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there were not the pictures and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a sloppy boy with long, dark hairs calls it.
When it answers him, the fellow students look at it surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun day dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? She's wondering at times.
But she knows that this boy and the other drums aren't real and disappear.
At night the appearances are most anxious
Often the trumpets are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can't sometimes follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just presents a new fellow student while he explains mathematical equations for all other listening and visible on the table.
At night the appearances are mostly anxious.
If she waits for sleep in her dark room, which comes too rarely and much too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or already dreams, whether the pictures she sees, the fratzens or the girl with the bloody cut wounds of arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes arise.
Leave me alone, she screams the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her that they think they'd be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She's been living the Abitur last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wrong is also a work of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from riding, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says box.
I suppose the brain is then under-worked and provides for his own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, had as a little girl fear of other children, often she played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called Papa, since she can think, is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas, which also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish drummer images and reality. "Every experience," says box, "is taking place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to develop, so they work so real."
Also night dream images value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenes, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their drummers as irral.
Box therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as a special ability.
Limitation between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief Doctor of the Hospital for Psychiatrie and Psychotherapy of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also holds positives, creatives - Wahn is also an artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of traumaticly changed wax consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experienced one considers to be real and which he can't distinguish from the watch state.
The oneiroide state of consciousness is created in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradicitis patients who experience a motor lamination in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability of movement, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with a own imaginary world that has been disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary between dream and hallucination.
As a situation is not possible in reality, a change in the world takes place, but the real situation is realized in imagination.
An intense form of sense-making and sense-making in an irreversible situation that enables us to do not undergo our own designability in a nonsense of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his one-iroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness passes on travel for days after a cardiovascular surgery with subsequent cardiac transplantation, while his body is condemned to no movement at the intensive station.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: He experiences himself as a bed-laid, old man, on board a train anarium, a robot watches over his health.
In the early Middle Ages, he lives under adligents who produce crushes from blood.
It is dragged by a Greek on the motorcycle in its home country, surfing with its spidal bed in the Firnschnee of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes entirely on in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner trips differ fundamentally from every dream for Claussen.
Dream is another condition, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental travels are still overwhelming to me for years and in adjacent details.
More clear and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience sprinkles the horizon of our other life-like experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, Oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and drug rushing show how breachy our inner images of the outer reality are also in guards.
Every change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist's box emphasizes, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow break can come
Burda
Children are supposed to take over 27 years of publishing
The new publisher Kallen is an intermediate solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company in the hands of his two children, he said to SPIEGEL.
The Holding is supposed to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the strong will to enter the company, said the 69-year-old to the SPIEGEL.
We have made provision for the details of this.
The question of whether they are active in the company is only afterwards.
The question is whether they are in a position to do so.
It is not possible to introduce 7500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company too.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he withdrawed from the Board of Directors from January, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen appointed his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board at Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with Treasury's responsibility for corporate assets, and after the expiry of Jürgen Todenhöfer also came to direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the publisher.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to "overbridge 10, 15 years," says Burda.
The Holding should also be 100 percent of the family in the future, said Burda.
With a view to the cases of fate and Schaeffler, Burda said that also family companies are not sure before the fall: "This was always the case with families that were affected by a capital addiction that had been completely speculated and thought they could rise to a very large player.
My strategy was never.
He didn't have world power dreams, says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the World League with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Full Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a store store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything is only about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find among other elevated companies such as Hedonai, who provide for a de hairing with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxing and beauty treatment; the Friseure Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that emerges through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
A relaxing massage together with your partner and at the same time have a fantastic view of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours in order to put your own "beauty party" with eight friends on the legs and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, split for the latest face and body treatments as well as for the hydro therapy to 12 rooms.
For example, for the cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating areas.
The fitness studio also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who care for the customer's training units and thus offer them a perfect personal training.
You start a training unit with entering a personal password on a touch screen, which is opposite the devices.
Afterwards you will show various videos how to perform your training units properly.
The director of the fitness studio assures that 15 minutes (including warming and dishes) are perfect enough to train the body muscles.
And then if you want to look through the hairsalon after you trained your body, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments are offered for renewing hair pracht, shine and health in a personalized way for your hair.
Innovation and exclusiveness seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 22 a.m. at night 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and therefore it is again a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our clothes cabinet.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has selected an overdriven and very complicated decolleté, and you can only guess about it.
Endsa and Barcelona with the electric car
The power company Endsa, together with the city of Barcelona, created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the capital of Catalan.
The "LIVE-Büro" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinateing, subsidieing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is to be developed to promote the electric car and opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to promote the transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endsa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include such activities that are linked to energy and in particular to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative to take part in the endsa with regard to the promotion of electric cars.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the automotive sector
The Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesies the Spanish automotive industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "a horizon of tranquility".
On the presentation of the Economic Report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero reminiscent of the measures which the government has launched to support the automotive sector during the year of the government.
"Without the plan on the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we today would have a panorama of neglect and the cessation of some of our main production works," said the Government President.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automotive manufacturers to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the coin of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also reminded that the plan for competitiveness, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers providing investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended for the development of new models, as well as for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to raise demand, in addition to the 2000E plan, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the autonomous manufacturers.
According to the head of government , this plan allows the gases to be reduced by 6% for the new vehicles sold on the Spanish market on average, which, in turn , resulted in a " strong increase" in the authorisations which increased by 40 percent in November.
On 20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classic Automotive Fair is organized, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.
This fair will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pabellón de Cristal of Casa de Campo in Madrid.
On an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands.
You can not only admire classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all the only suspicious items related to the world of engines at the ClassicAuto Madrid.
This allows the exhibitors to find accessories, spare parts, components, materials accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc. at the exhibition.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classic engines that will enthusiast the collectors and lovers.

It will also be carried out skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles on a specially furnished race track in the outdoor area of the exhibition site.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental sports
Mazda wants to prove that sports is strictly compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and drive system of the engine, baptized on the name i-Stop, a device, which is currently only available for the 2.0 gas engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 is highlighted by their good notes in the overall image.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its strategic behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seat you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
In addition, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
When you further consider the unit consisting of the instrument board and the armature board, you can find that Mazda is located on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the spectacular colors red and blue.
This style reminds us partly of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, are degrading from the naïvity of the German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive the car very conveniently.
All of this is a large-scale and clearly shaped suitcase.
The stop and drive system is only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 PS and a 6-speed switch.
This engine is a real enjoyment. It is based on its purity, its quiet noise, its services and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in the switching and its low consumption, even if the diesel models are mostly sold in Mazda.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called sportive model selected for the sample is a speciality, since it has a much greater number of elements from the series equipment.
From the serial reception, especially the wizard for the driving track change (RVM), which thus removes the dead angle, but also the control elements for traction and stability, the speed control, the light sensitive interior mirror, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors for imparking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch velves.
In addition, this version also includes, as if it was not yet enough for equipment, the Premium package, which contains for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to further elements, especially the learning bixenon lamps and the sound system BOSE with CD chargers.
Concern
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not place many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative on this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21.770 euros for the Luxury model and 23.270 euros for the test-driven model Sportive.
However, as an equivalent to this high price, the Mazda3 offers us to the new highest passport every day.
A Premiere with a lot of Glamour
L. A. rolls out the red teppich of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, radiated more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "pe", as elegant as always, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too restricted, a device with which you can only read your emails without a way of seeing some attachments or surfing through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is especially of interest to young people.
In contrast to the smartphones, Peek costs only very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success, it has placed two new devices on the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a life-long free service for data, in contrast to the Peek, where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all over Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to leave all the data to read their emails once you cross the country border or if you desperately look for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of the roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but after my experience you already need a doctoral title in physics and a good glass to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission regarding affordable roaming rates for all over Europe remained almost always unrespectful.
Apart from your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and that rightly.
The fact that a small device such as FonPeek (when it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it has no Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs means that the telephone providers have to consider different ways of using their data network slowly but safely, and have to reconsider and start to consider.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices the download of books and other requests on the Internet is included.
Without Vetrag and without hooks.
This is an Internet-capable device and one pays for it only one time, namely, when buying, and not monthly for month.
And that is exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a buying possibility with lifelong Internet access as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I'll read my emails with the phone, thank you.
Especially I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Even when Barack Obama was president of the U.S. president, she appeared in a dress and a dress of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him at his second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models on both occasions: it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, consisting of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and it wore somewhat large-shaped or a necklace.
It is even so far as it has appeared at the first glance that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturia and had decided to wear the same dress in more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different from the type of fabric that they are made from.
She wore a dress made of top and in Oslo a carved saddle.
The accessories were also different: for the first time, green shoes with semi-high paragraphs and for the second time a shameful model, but gold.
The hairdress was also different every time: the hair was placed as a hairdress at this occasion, at the previous time she wore the hair open.
75% of the mothers employed have got problems in work because of their maternity
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially in the younger women who want to have children.
This result is the study conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women "Fruchtability and Career of Women in Spain".
The survey of 9.737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 makes no doubt: 75% of women employed see their career opportunities restricted in the labour market due to their maternity.
The study reveals that there are great differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of occupation they exercise.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-days or do not have a fixed contract, become more mothers and have more children.
On the other hand, women shift with a fixed position, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and maternity, and therefore also have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed position get their first child on average only 3.7 years after merging, which increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed job that have longer been used to achieve this and who have brought together their first child and have only realized the first child much later.
In addition, the kind of work also has a great influence on maternity, although less than the calendar regarding the willingness of reception," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is increasing, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they have only the main school or higher education, were on average at 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time mother.
Furthermore, according to their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with the main conclusion already marry before their first festival and get their first child, it makes the women with a middle or high school degree exactly different and look for a festival and marry after that and then get their first child, Delgado sets out.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'OMontréal Paris has recently added a new name to his all-inclusive list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will be the image of different products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertisement term "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will become another famous hanging sign as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
In front of her were the last who were allowed to join this exclusive club the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
The cosmetic company has only an exception message: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Schauspielkollege von Evangeline in "Lost").
The award of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual prize grant held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They all appeared on this occasion.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model this year.
Manuel Vicent's poker game
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) to the thirty-three X-ray pictures of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearful genre (curzbiography, life and work), but looks for an anxiety to the glowing heartpiece of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not save to fears or reliefs.
Authentics that this book is a delicious reader, it is also an appealing invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his sides, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I always felt it without finding words for it: the joy in contrast to the unhealthy destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "He wrote of what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between ignorance and ignorance, with a thrilling poetic humor, without any sense, such as the knifes that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was united by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, who moved into her bans, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was in getting into heaven on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was released in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. It is one of the 8000 summits in the world's literature, you have to climb up on the north wall, on the wall at which the best mountain climbers are always trying again and again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a strange cow.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the inheritance of a property owner of the county, and again he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were witnessed by a certain grave.'
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the mad cry that was screamed out from a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo swarmed down to the night of the 20th century on a literary way. This made him on a journey to flee from himself and with a speech full of violence from the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled and prayed: My dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: ' the sleep after the effort,/ after the thunder of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a satisfactory life, one finds pleasure in death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depressions.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was pioneering it between the Azaleen or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man gave so much patience and was in love with a neurotian, whose literary talent was still much grueBer than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos make than trying to inflame Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroja to the arms of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he may put himself on this podium?"
Fig. Agression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our part of the town in Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people from 15 to 18 years of age came next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixture we have taken from the animal home and we just weighed six kilos, and then they missed him two pedestrians and hurt him hardly.
Our disarmament can not be written, as it is incomprehensible for us, because the spass is supposed to be in favour of a cheap agression against a small and helpless animal, which of course has been executed on the line.
In addition, when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, for if such a mad man attacked a dog, he may also be able to do the same with a woman, a child, an older master, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been cheerful all day long.
Of course, we have given an advertisement in a nearby police department, but we have great doubts about whether this will bring something at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the fig criminals were Spanish.
Our disapproval of the events has led us to display this incident.
We cannot understand what needs to be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on a animal that gives us love, society, and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), the tyre manufacturer Michelin launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially in the younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment with regard to transport security, which "proves far more than only the design and manufacture of products that become increasingly safe every day" and continued to confirm that it also contributes with other actions educational and informative characters to bring this goal a step closer every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle running under the slogan 'To be or not to be' will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that transport security is "an ongoing concern" of the company, and just because it always sees itself as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles obliged to be one of its main goals to be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small load cars rises slightly again
After nearly two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles approved in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008, and, much more important, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months with steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac producer association and the Ganvam car dealer association.
However, these good figures are at the moment only with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison of November 2008, which was a particularly bad shortage year with a 60% reduction in the previous year.
However, it must be remembered that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months are still 40 % below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles from which the small transporter market is included are: extracts of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small trucks and lighter small trucks/cars.
Moreover, the same clouds in the sky are still the same, most demanding, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by individuals, the volume of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which, in almost 100 % of all cases, are going to be purchased with third-financing.
For example, we need to include further factors such as the increase in unemployment rates or the persistence of the poor economic situation in these restrictions, which are the consequences of the credit institutions.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, financial support has helped little to buy a vehicle of the 2000E plan.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, even self-employed and small companies have a right to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it is essential for the state to focus on these small loads as well as on industrial vehicles (sustainable cars and car buses).
The car dealer association prophesies a similar year for 2010 as the past, for which it expects a fall in sale (in passenger cars and terrain cars) of 19%.
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the antiblocking brake system ABS and as it is now happening with the ESP stability control, the aid systems for braking in emergency cases must become a mandatory equipment in the European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and light small transporters, for the rest of the vehicles, a carpentry period was established by the end of February 2011.
The measure decided by the European Union aims to improve the protection of fusioners, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents.
The emergency brake assistant's task is to exercise more pressure on braking in the case of a critical brake manoeuvre which recognizes the system using the brake strength performed by the driver on the brake spedal.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not come to the brake spedal before the collage, and half of them had not burned out with full force.
Up to 1.100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, absorbs the brake system with maximum force and thus reduces the brake time and thus also the brake brake resistance, which a car reverses during brake operation.
According to a EU study, up to 1.100 fatal accidents in which effluents are damaged could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would be even less accidents - one expects that every fourth accident could be prevented with human damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects (over radar or camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time it already exercises a light pressure on the brakes.
When the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake spedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the assault is already inevitable, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors Moves the Plan for Opel until January
While the opel work in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has been informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the party concerned already agrees on each single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there is works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the next days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car builders so that it can make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Gely, who also likes to buy Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, who has a Russian group of Converg back cover, gains increasingly stronger consent.
If none of these buyers were to come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to shut Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will also continue to maintain.
On the control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it easier for 80 kilos, with which he is now bringing only 1.275 kilos to the scale.
In order to create such a thing, they abandoned the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent wall with manual drive, so they alone saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "distrain" further 15; by removing the air conditioning even more 13; also, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres, so that another 7 kilos were saved; through the installation of sporty Bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch velves again five.
Then, by abandoning the audio system CDR-30, another six kilograms less had been reached and by the exchange of the door handles through the handles of the fabric the missing kilogram.
Although it is also available with the double-coupling powered PDK, the sampling trip with a vehicle with 6-way hand gears was carried out, mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain tracks that were really very curious.
In his driving behavior you can only give him the note awkward.
However, the reduction of its weight has not resulted in any way that it would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite of the case: we haven't tried so a small and light model since long, which also gives you a feeling of great security at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlet to warm his muscles at a low corridor in the required time until we give him the commands to shave, to brake, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again ...
He's doing everything you say to him. The car does everything we're doing to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has succeeded and it can be increased with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which has already been used in the Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginable brutal, no matter whether it is out of the standing or when it is again accelerated.
The feathers are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the land tracks, on which we were driving with the boxest spyer, was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route; and that was, although we found some of these curves of ice in the morning gray and rollsplits in the morning morning.
In summary, one can say that there is an ultra-slight car, a car with which you have an unwritten passport, as it may otherwise be rather rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be marketed in February 2010 and will cost 70.831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of Coco Coco Cocoon's cosmetic line and an opportunity starlet at the fashion views of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same necklessness as her pockets of Chanel.
More than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives himself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complex football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the huge appearance of Mirza Teletovic, which was with eight three times the best of his team (29 in the review).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant outfalls of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas, or Micov by a large dose of use and team work, even if they had to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great results from the perimeter with 16 judged three times contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue reds, which sat from the beginning to the top on the advertisement board.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it was already possible to announce that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
They were English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was barely different, only that the team from Álava decided for a inner-sided game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received at his return to the team with piffs and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage to the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" assessment of Splitter already indicates that this would not be the best evening of Brazilians.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the Vitorians were still not determined, and the Makkabians wanted to remember that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of Elias" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the turning of the "Gelbes" the rower (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but all other than dead, had to prepare a couple of game trains with secrecy to get air again, and with one of them suddenly came the pistool of Mirza Teletovic, who had three consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, to ensure that reconciliating distance of (54-67) was displayed on the advertisement board, which the host could shine with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavesen were blossomed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they earned honestly in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, who did not get the best of their team and tried to give her team back by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splitter was placed from the place for Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended himself well and although the Israelis were still picking up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being commanded
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to enter the leadership in the group B of the Euroliga, which was marked in a game that was marked by the failures of Unicajas (freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially during the interior game, which facilitated the Greeks to win.
The Málaga team had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which may be one of the strongest Europeans and possesses a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts blinded 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olimpiacos was surprised by the intensity of the one Unicaja, even though the local team with an interior game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis made it possible that the advertisement board in the 13th minute 22-20 showed in favor of her, the minute when it had come to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams, and for which both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to get warm and his superiority on both sides of the game, while the exclusion of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez left clear traces in Unicaja.
Among her players in the inner field and the Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with his three times, they increased their advantage to 44-32 in the 19th minute.
A retirement hunt was impossible
The third play quarter was characterized by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, showed himself and even managed to compensate the difference of the game carried out in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which led the leadership within the group.
Unicaja tried to overtake the many failures and the elimination of the scott Robert Archibald injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for Unicaja, a few hopes came again in the 31st minute thanks to the spring and three times Cook and the use of Lewis on 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was impossible, since the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, were not to be braked.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase corb differences to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be struck and had to take off the leadership of Olympiacos.
How much should you earn in Facebook due to your profile?
The users of Facebook can now experience their salary due to their profile, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most displays of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you deserve?" calculates the salaries of the users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users are available in Facebook to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
After a week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish employees were on average "healthly paid," explains Albert Ribera, responsible for the product, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross content of 45,226 euros and a French 31.059, unlike the 24,000 euros worth a Spanish.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net content of EUR 34.247 in England, EUR 25.751 in France and EUR 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the most poorly paid work in Spain is the one cellar with EUR 11.592 per year; followed by the work of a seller with EUR 14.725 and one worker with EUR 15.667 per year.
The most sought sites on the Internet in the last three months are one driver, half-day offices and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its message in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave the diplomatic representation no later than 27 January 2010 if his mandate expires officially.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegation of the Brazilian Embassy in the doguran capital, confirmed the TV Globo television broadcaster that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware of the need to go on January 27, as his mandate goes down on this day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the ex-President who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the date set: "My position is, as soon as possible, logically with the back coverage of the Brazil government," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (in which Porfirio Lobo was a winner) Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
However, this failed in the refusal of Zelayas to recognise the status of an asylum-seeking politician who wanted to impose him on the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the most lucrative days since last spring, where the inflation of the assets was the prevailing mood on the markets, the insecurity has returned to the markets, which is not surprising in any case, as it is its natural state, in a environment where the mackerel make decisions about a naturally insecure future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate the debts with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly allow liquidity to be free of hand in interest which moves around zero so that banks buy assets to pay off.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as well as finished and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, begin to stretch some sand into the gear, as BCE nac already suggested with its annual auction, the next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we will just witness to a conversion in reducing risk premiums.
The refugees of the stock exchanges and the differences in the corporate bonuses will rise again, even if they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to state the private risks and the government debts were increasing again.
It is now replacing on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the euro area countries in Germany.
Spain has not yet been affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision on the evaluation of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain insecurity does not harm the defendant of the moral risk, which had once again tried to put a consciousness on the part of the responsible world economic policy, because they had disrupted the devastating effects of the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs when they were supposed to have a new day of thanks.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai indicates to a tribal war between the emiria to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was foretold earlier.
A government that deprives the debt of the State, elections and a new government that draws the same way.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense that Ecofin save Hungary from the non-compliance of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, thus allowing a euro Member State to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into the duty to maintain the stability of government funds in the event of the necessity of customary licensing.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excursions to too high amounts, that would now be within the expectation.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European corporate bonus.
However, if the European differences are reduced and Spanish continue to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
This of Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for restoration and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, who come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all of them do not promise long life, despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "precaution in driving" is said.
Coupled branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, appeared yesterday before the Parliament's Subcommittee, where, in these days, the strategy on Spain's energy supply is debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, on which the Chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, followed, Galán gave the press some points about what he had submitted to the Subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion from that date until 2030, under the prerequisite that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this was not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that you should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
From 2020 onwards, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energies.
In such a case, he assumes that 18,000 MW are needed more, naturally under the prerequisite by other "substance energy".
Galán, who believes that the draft text for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, was on a line with what his company requested, was not in any case in favour of this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
He believes that "on the long term, despite some" individuals, measures were taken, as the Chairman of Iberdrola mentioned.
If it is like it, Galán thinks that you should already make decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, because it will take some time and have to be created a stable compensation framework to take them into action.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish flu company Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been announced, has been set up to five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol on cooperation for the creation of an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The Alliance plans to invest from 20 million to 2012, from which 50% of Ferrovial will come.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the examination of energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the approval of his first motorway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about EUR 1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A 5 kilometer long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself as a construction company and motorway operator in the country.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration for public-private cooperation (PPP has decided to be the English abbreviation) to advance the project after a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already owned by a final list of candidates for the construction and the toll administration.
In the expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to EUR 1.7 billion in Australia (1.047 billion), competing with three consortia, particularly European construction companies, during the last phase.
The group called Transcity is quoted by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second with its headquarters in Italy is one of the best specialists for deep construction.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium Northern Direct, formed from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for infrastructure and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company high depth, which belongs to ACS), which is also local building stones (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, specialized in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises enormous construction and privatisation, however, has a barrier to overcome, since only the purchase of an indigenous building company can be accessed.
A strategy followed by the above-mentioned companies high depth or bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that must be pursued by the Spanish Baugigants.
Even ACP has only gained access to this market by its participation of 30% in high depth, owner of the Leighton.
millions of assets
Acciona is of utmost importance in this geographical area for the industry, in which it is already known as an energy provider and in the sale industry due to its activity.
Among other assets, it already has its large windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads to the group of companies that were commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's salad plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies in order to accommodate the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground toll line, which is promoted by the city infrastructure office of Brisbane and is home to Northern Link (North link) has the purpose of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the transversal route in Kelvin Grove(see map) on a length of 5 kilometers through tunnels, which is the largest measure for stabilising on the streets of Brisbane.
The map issued by the City Administration provides for the grant for summer 2010 and the start of construction work next December.
Even if this toll line is to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is assumed that the construction work will last until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two tracks in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland participates in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For high depth, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia continues to pay considerable orders to high depth, which signed a contract with the government last night, a total of 154 million.
The ACP sub-company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre cables through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400.000 people and the German company will employ for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet started and high depth has received 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it also competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
Initial investments amount to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has given itself over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres long for a highway in Slovenia over the total of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received more than 130 million for the construction work to expand the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria).
In this way Alpine strengthens his experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertisement from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the Sra Agency. Rushmore announced a total of about three million euros annually, the railway company.
This contract also provides the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore has been selected under 16 agencies presenting to this competition issued by Renfe, 4 of which came to the final round, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and manufacture of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom due to the outbreak of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty over EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has reduced competition for fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programs for consumers at the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than EUR 560 million of penalties since 1994 because of the disability of its competitors.
The penalty that was imposed yesterday was even increased, since the authority who is waiting for competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar distresses in the past and has therefore become retroactive.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trade page on the Internet with a view to increasing revenue from businesses that do not come from the telephone connection.
In principle, this site of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until this settlement will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League has developed its origin in 1992 as a source of revenue for the football club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, which brings them the third and fifth place of the Fuβball Clubs that have earned most money in the Liga.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the Champions League of the UEFA, not only brings glory with itself. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the large clubs.
According to the UEFA, the Liga has distributed up to 5.362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (that is 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since their founding in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona benefited from this distribution.
The White Club is located in the third part of Europe, which has earned most money through its participation and which, next to the AC Milan, won the trophy three times.
The official Catalan master and the last winner of the former Europecups in 1992 is the fifth place.
The list leads to Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams, who also took the most money through their participation in the last Champoins League.
And that's even though they lost Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries who could take money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, contrary to four by Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated funding procedure applied by the UEFA.
In this financial year, the organisation, whose chairman Michel Platini has, counts on 1,090 million revenue by the Champions League.
From this money, the UEFA will provide 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the precursorship (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they argued, those who struggled to participate, received 3.8 million through their blossoming presence.
There is also a bonus for profits (800,000 euros) and for a difference (400,000 per team). The clubs who have come to the eighth finals each receive three million; the four who have come to the quarter finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the Second, which receives 5.2 million.
So a football club gets at least 7.1 million and up to 31.2 million in fixed revenues.
Barça earned 2.5 million in August with his victory at the European Supercup.
However, there are still variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is given proportionally to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 places.
The master of last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play in this year edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group has sent out yesterday details about the purchase offer of shares, with which it wants to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage which does not force it to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In the concrete, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share paid to ten years and with an interest rate of 1 % annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed by EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jeréz gives the shareholders a period of 15 days to share their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it has not been informed about this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had been in contact with the authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos 254,27 million is.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In trying to remain at the edge of possible purchases and the judicial crossings of his ex-manager, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book review.
A decision she becomes the first woman who has a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created post, directly under the chairman of the group.
This is all other than free from polemics, because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of relocation of more than 230 million sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos shifts further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the loan of the Salazar yesterday, ex-advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public expulsion invitation from Paternina submitted by the Investment Company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public expulsion invitation for Federico Paternina submitted by the Investment Company Mer last October.
The Supervisory Authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions are adhered to the legally binding laws and, therefore, the content of the document submitted, following the changes made last 2 December, can be considered as "abundant".
CNMV has also informed that this offer aims at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which is in turn 8.95 % of the capital of the company, composed of 6.142.786 euros in shares approved on the exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
In addition, it was noted that 5.592.778 million shares have been established, which cannot be transferred until the end of the invitation to tender and whose price was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the legal laws.
New vehicles review programmes
In these days of injuries and accidents, not only the KFZ workshops are deserving
Each day thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops where a consultant has to evaluate the damages caused and the costs for repair.
No single accident is equal and the calculation of costs for the parts and hours of work can be a long-term and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools it is a question of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of the advisors use this type of systems.
The service providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs shall collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies compete with the tool market for evaluation and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data that the manufacturers provide is all other than easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Head of Sales of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them provides the information in another format.
In addition, the volume of data to be processed is increasingly larger than the point that over the last five years more versions, variants and engineizations have come to the market than over the past fifteen years.
Once a new car comes to the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a tiring task, because each of the But000 vehicles parts has to be catagulated and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold model, the work can be completed in one week if the procedure is rapidly going forward.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently Audatex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain with full information.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road vehicle park, it is more than 99 %.
Audatex has eight centres distributed (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually specialists for mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros each year in the preparation of these databases.
Each month they take up 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use them in a variety of ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for the calculation of the securities or residual value of a car.
The only company that is about a driver who informs about the value of the cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, you can easily provide an overview of the kind of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for examining accidents for the advisors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive it will be for customers who rarely use it up to ten times a month, namely 5,75 euros a month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that makes thousands of advice negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the mounting tape, on the basis of the ticket number.
AudaGlass is engaged in the vehicle drives, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for the professional market, with which you can offer for vehicles which have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or for receiving information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, it can be examined how many models of a particular car brand had to be involved in the workshop due to pans or how many of them had been involved in a severe accident during a certain period of time.
Gt motifs is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It is distributed among other Gt Estimates, which is also intended for consultants and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions to assess damage, pans or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 advisors and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually over the last three years, and in 2008 sales amounted to EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of their business are operated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% in North and South America. They work together with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.

To this end, the company has revenues of EUR 19.1 million, 7.2 % more than the previous year.

Since 2007 they have been at the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a plate foam on the Internet for the sale of accidental vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% in the next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increases with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This review and purchasing service is exclusively used to industry experts such as insurance companies, consultants, car hire companies, workshops, scraps and car dealers who need to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and managed more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of which alone in Germany.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 advisors.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose number of passengers has been registered may no longer be driven on the streets, but it may be used as spare parts for certain non-defected parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value may be reapproved even if they have been logged out after difficult authorities.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost forecast.
The ease of handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 terrain cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the driving position number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, surcharges or discounts, and afterwards, it can print the cost estimate and pass on to its customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool to evaluate such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the estimated working hours are not included in the workshop.
The cost of use for this tool is EUR 350 per year, a amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
The Audatex company is currently working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that Automechanics have long waited for, for example, because you can choose a door with her and then turn the image completely to view the inside.
