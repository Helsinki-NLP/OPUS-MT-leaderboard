28-year-old cook found in San Francisco Mall dead
A 28-year-old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre.
The brother of the sacrifice said that he couldn't imagine anyone who would harm him, "In the end it went up with him again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, informed the court medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as a murder and the investigations are taking place.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had a six-month dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
A speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked over his death and destroyed on the ground".
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our compassion are with Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia announced that Frank was first living in hostels, but that, "the things were finally going up for him."
"He found a apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anybody who wanted to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
To connect his kind with his family, it was always to cook us something to prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swimed with the electricity.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this unspeaked diamond, who brightly shined every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD's phone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always placed in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star has now made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside labels that have mostly little to do with me and the reality."
"I myself don't want to always be perfect and successful."
"Really, these things are more tricky to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh about being "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "cosmopolitan".
After all, the actress spends her time at home, form TV with a luxurious dot and Mexican food, says the magazine.
To the white glut, they ask for the child's wish: "We do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," says Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" Aniston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from 25 August.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are overlookable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit differential with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Goldene Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their celebration evening, they hunted home at the fast Galopp to the feed drills.
A mile at that pace, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," Langer says.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - was back near horses.
He and his family were led to the ALRV plant, and he didn't even swallow himself for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was very convincing.
In the context of a small Gala, the German sports aid gave the man from Anhausen the Golden Sports Pyramid.
The awards do not lack the sympathic athletes.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has arranged him.
Longer is the 18th winner of sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "for it is awarded not only for sports successes but also for social engagement."
For decades Langer has been promoting the young.
And so he also passed on the price of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-fold US master winner was added to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the outstanding are the light-atletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fighter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-father Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Springreiter Alwin Schockemöhle, and posthum of the Handballer Erhard Wonderful.
Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrated company moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance to the great animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.
However, the two U.S. President-in-Offices are unanimous in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the State.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to control the economy to death and regulate it, he says.
He himself would be quite different, claims Trump.
He will reverse regulations massively, and he makes strong for a widespread tax reform with lower tax rates - for private and businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the State has certain tasks to fulfill, has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money to do so.
That's why the taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton have to be invested in.
The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-critical teaparty flights of the Republicans.
So Trump could still have part-time discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and re-establish coal promotion in the USA.
Oil promotion should also be possible in areas that have been protected so far, the Paris Climate Agreement will be announced.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand renewable energy and asks: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It'll be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.
At the same time, however, the US does not want to insulate international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.
They are supposed to be better paid, for example, called Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to increase it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must rise, then he says he may not be changed.
However, the great discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics reserve him so that the budget deficit would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least of the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Flight: "Each fleeing woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
In a large kitchen, four women are sitting.
Everyone has a baby that's up to one year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curious in the room with big eyes.
His mother stars on the tableboard.
Until she notices she's being observed.
She's smiling shortly and kissing the little one.
The scene works normally.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a business leader of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and is dealing with the subject of women on the escape.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in Munich North in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Assistance.
She was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - neither as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say, every woman who comes here has experienced sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men fleeing for wars because they are politically persecuted because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hopemakers," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape prevail: "Many steal secretly because they don't see any other way out."
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forces, murders of honor, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
On the run, this is going on.
"That slepper, for example, demands a bottle of water for sexual action is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who thinks this ends as soon as they arrived in Germany, is misleading, says Bahr.
Even here, single women in refugee accommodations would often be viewed as inferior and worst abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in Munich north are traumatized.
"Some of the children certainly have not been born voluntarily."
Many women are so common that they don't say anything.
"Of they don't trust to talk openly about the experienced because the shame is too great."
Since they often don't know to help, it only needs more accommodation for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
On the question whether they would know of a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no.
There is no such thing in government accommodation in the upper pillar and upper french.
Even in Schwaben, only refugee women are not separately accommodated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press speaker of the government.
In Upper Bavaria, under- and middle freaks there are floors or own houses in some Community accommodations for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are hosted separately."
"If the privacy is concerned or men and women are accommodated together, it can come to - persistent - violence against women."
Especially the laundry should be separated and easily accessible to women, the study states.
How the women feel this need for protection, you can know the Andrang that is on the house in Munich.
"Because we've been talking about, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistanceists are striving: demands for new labour fighting measures
Representatives of Assistant Doctors have called on their union to approve new labour struggles in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called for its entire Council to approve more work fighting from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that Ministers would have absent to respond to the concerns regarding the Treaty.
Assistance technicians and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would remain "satisfactory" to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to reject the proposed new treaty completely and asks for official renewal for all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today has submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a current programme of escalating labour fighting that begins in early September.
The disputes led to the six-time streaking of assistant artists this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The director of BMA Assistant Artists Dr. Johann Malawana returned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students that the contract should be beneficial and accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be imposed.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterplayer in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile was slim and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restraining conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had taken it as if never happened something bad.
His enthusiasm seemed to show the opposite.
But one of Putin’s radiant, sustainable cooling shows that the Head of State of Russia hadn't forgotten anything.
Instead, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the abolition of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was pronounced.
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen Russia in the back.
The wrong was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding vetraue will be difficult if not even impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led to a severe, complete attack on Ankara.
At once it seemed that the Turks were guilty of everything.
Most seriously, the accusations of leading officials were that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has contradicted this.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia could book a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost dismissed in a failed state strike last month.
He was also shocked by repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90 %.
In Russia travel organizers and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, public television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti expressed it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry in the West, as it considers its response to the attempted acquisition of power to respond as a weak response.
In addition, the persistent grief over the pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is desirable to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.
The Russian head of the state in Ankara certainly won a bonus for calling for support for the chosen government bodies after the attempted state strike.
This is a natural nature for Moscow, which has a deep fear of changing regimes.
The summit in this glorious sea palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once described, "alliance of outsiders": two countries that are infringed from the West and feel badly treated and now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support counterparts.
It might be significant that after nearly three hours of first talk, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even struck the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately refused to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator of Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostility - and in the light of the potential for a perfect disaster, than NATO member Turkey dismissed the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State at least speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is intended to be reduced only to a backoffice roll, according to the head of the bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the global ambitions of the Bank.
The bank has been distant since it had to be almost collapsed and saved eight years ago.
At this time, trade marks "RBS" have been used to protect other end-user financial marks.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbleddon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock notation will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will receive more meaning - Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will be our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nation’s sponsoring and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sports sponsoring.
"It's time for us to develop to the bank of brands, because how do we focus on the inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Chief Executive Officer.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves its 3,000th profit on predilection at Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th profit
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British profit at Newmarket on Friday.
He set on predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He followed Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won at Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened to Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes up the joy when he won the victory on predilection
Two Jockeys reached the milestone in the barrier race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4.300 victories in a record breaking career.
Lester Piggott, who had nine times Derbysieger 4.493 career victory
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the other in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, enthusiasm and charisma have been enthusiastic for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already gained 6,000 gains if he was not just a weekend and big turnierjockey!
Frankie has already travelled in GB almost 30 years winners, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of large turbines, including its famous "Glorreichen Sieben" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane absurd and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to support his twins and return to his best form.
And he's not at the end for a long time - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until his at least 50th year of life.
Russia's Putin fires head of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly left his staff chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the closest trust group of Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed a special representative for environmental and transport matters.
In an opinion of the Kreml it is that without giving reasons, Putin "has ordered Ivanov's release of his duties as President of the Russian Presidency Administration".
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's alternate since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he completed the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kreml's website, it is said (in Russian) that he was later a protocol head and head of the government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your confidence."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as Head of State on drafts and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putins for a long time and works as he works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of the staff resigned on his own request.
But despite the smile for the camera, few are convinced here - especially now, just before Parliament's elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one currently knows that.
But the official claim - that a man who was once called as a potential president - would at once want to lead Russian environmental policy - came to great scepticism.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kreml website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to trust me this very complicated post - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it appears, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his alternate.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he most trusted.
Once Ivanov was assumed that after Putin's second term of office I could become President of Russia, as a third term of office of Putin had violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close, close ally Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was part of a physical conflict last month at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his cancellation in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized in public on Thursday before the notice of his notice.
On the set there were artistic differences and disagreements.
I repent of the incident," he said in a communication.
Details about how the character Gibsons from the series followed by a team of FBI agents are reported to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who had previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been part of the series since the first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart blood in the last twelve years," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and above all the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned radiation of the twelfth season is set on 28 September.
Puzzles to fish landing in garden in Banff
An inhabitant of Banff called for help in identifying the fish, which appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandale, which was poured out by a spring fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches of long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: bridge now connected with fife
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the North Deck of Queensferry Crossing with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "Deckfloor" which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 ropes.
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passport.
Overall, almost 79% of the entire bridgedecks at their place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete gun for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted at its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project.
With this fantastic project, the closure represents high and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection to the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the remaining gaps on the north or the countryside.
This was achieved by dragging the north bridge of the bridge of the bridge of the bulk of the bulk of the bulk of the bulk of the bulk of the bulk of the bulk of the bulk.
This was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at an increase of about 3 %.
Hekel, since the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they only had a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything was very good.
Salvation in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "being happy to be alive"
Three men have "happy to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit at 13:20 BST alarm on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swiming in safety, while their boat moved out of their own force.
"We saw the boat turning around and imagining the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have already wounded the boat out of its reach until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found on a Boje hanging without a rescue west.
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have been lucky and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop, it dissolved from the person who managed the boat when the boat was sent.
Someone watched these men today.
Seriously injured - man looks at his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-friend in Hamburg with a knife and severely injured.
As the police told yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized offender cut the clothing of his ex-friend.
When this came into the apartment, he put on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by hand and body.
The police could arrest the offender.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-friend's clothes, he called his mother.
This alarmed his sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-olds wanted to calm down her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her companion.
On the street they met the man's ex-life companion.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-friend.
Who builds cheap apartments for Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens think that investors will be much more obliged to be taken into account in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "trading concept of living" at the next Council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who should actually build the favourable apartments?
There is no regulation so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: Who wants to build on urban areas will need to show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the favourable apartments can also arise in stock.
However, Bratmann said: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors in such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments."
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann, "There is currently no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible.
Left wants still hard conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market has been intensified.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More personnel is needed.
It's unclear whether we're gonna get the professionals.
However, the programme is not entirely available, because the about 1260 new apartments that should be built at all.
But how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 favourable apartments whose promotion will expire in the next few years?
Only by 2020 there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning spokesman Nicole Palm, the city should now buy out running bonds.
In addition, it would need to be thought about getting apartments back to the price binding.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved at a stroke.
For in the western city, deadlines end in the end of the year.
About 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price bond for affordable apartments.
Only: The owners, the housing companies don't want that.
Because the number of social apartments in the western city is radically increased, one is removed from the target of the so-called mix.
There is no longer a concentration of social weaknesses in a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will be still movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a wide majority the CDU must be in the boot."
Although they concentrated on more buildings for one-family houses.
But what does not mean that there is still no compromise.
Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and luck worthwhile
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure with staring on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.
At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and last to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities are not outside each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a drawing series, play cards and other spin-offs).
How many phenomena of the pop culture decreased interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand early July.
The introduction of the market into other countries was moved by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.
Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than tin and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "fotografated" (with a screenshot on the phone) or "catched".
A generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the madness and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the USA, the game led to a significant increase in steps that deferred the "average" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who followed 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people who train 30 minutes each day ran from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays from Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public education campaigns to health that people want to "take 30 minutes," "to come from the sofa" and "to be active every day" stuck on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who seem disgraceful.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be over-evaluated.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances to suffer from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to put them here.
But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.
So three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on hunting.
Likewise, there are mural game decayers that have always to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run at a door.
What are you doing?
It happened a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps such as Fitbit had already been able to follow our activity before, they gave us no reason to drive sports as this game does.
The new one will lose its attraction and the use will slow down with time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with activating in the real world and will help many people hunting to be more active, more fitting and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's tours
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
dynamic on the pedestrian.
Hardly on the bar.
Breathless on the ground.
On the whole line brilliant.
And at last also olympiasis.
The 19-year-old American tournament clommed on Thursday to the multi-course title and increased the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the light of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles turns on the swewbebar during the single multi-competence of women in the art tours at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-competitive title and a total of the fifth, while fortifying its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at this moment.
This success brings them into the same league as unique athletes as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sports for the last three years, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 olimpiant Mary Lou Retton said that she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final examination in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of over-dimensioned expectations.
Not with a handful of gold returning to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman embraced after each of them gained gold and silver in the single multi-competence of women in the art tours at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a cry mark at the graduation of the retirement team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles was on the top of their long way, never to have planned the future, this is not really true.
Some of their soil exercises, which contain their typical Tumbling Pass, are tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, which was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the Turnhalle, where Boorman trained.
She has lost no more competition since summer 2013, a victory series that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led lightly through two rotations, the picture deceived.
Swivel bars and soil towers - where Biles holds the world championship title.
She again picked up on the sulphur with 15,433 and put one on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman embraced her gentlely when they expected her endeavour - a pure formality - and tears flowed into beles shining red, white and blue eyelines, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tibreak.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her soil exercise, she threw to the audience kissing hand, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
With regard to Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a very new significance:
Police: 3 victims shot in series murder when listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girls were shot, who died in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first series murder of Phoenix, while they were talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The killer fired eight shots from a hand firearm while standing on the side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, read the report.
The police informed that the three-fold murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2.900, which were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to become a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people were killed in hispanese residents within four months in nine attacks and two more were injured.
"It happens in a residential area before a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white cadillac or Lincoln.
The intermitters refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.
One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting that targeted half an hour before the three times murder and was assumed that it was the work of the series murderer.
Investigators found cartridge huls and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I can't do that.
I can't do that.
That's what I didn't mean.
What's not right at all -- of course, you've come in to it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund may never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institutionalize him.
"My first answer was "I didn't know that people still do," said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of walking.
Edmund could not sit or crab until his third year of life, and he still cannot speak.
But he's making progress slowly.
He can run with support and cycling.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund's thought for "Please sing me something ahead."
"We bring him a sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund found some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as Mases or Zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary considerably.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an ignorant future.
I constantly asked what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't been asking for the prognosis for a long time, because I don't expect someone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It's gonna be better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Hot rainfall, flooding gives occasions for salvation in Louisiana, Mississippi
Several rainfalles and large floods in Louisiana forced the Governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is expected all Saturday with more rainfall.
Many rivers in the southeast of Louisianas and the south of Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened to extreme rainfall, reports the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that government officials are constantly in contact with the local authorities and have already been on the road to the communities concerned.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, informed that the requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sand bags increased.
Steele said that alone the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sand sacks.
A flooding warning system is used over large parts in the south of Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall.
In the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, will most likely reach over the weekend record level.
The meteologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flourish many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a flow downward flood in Ascension Parish represents a danger, since these rivers will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9.00.
Rescue teams still poured people from the flooding water into the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his step son were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said that another step son who lived nearby would have warned him.
"We wake up and the water flowed and flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they had been housed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "swiftly spread" because there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities would consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer reported from midnight to Friday from 13,75 inches of rain near Livingstone.
Krautmann said that the ground had been substantially accomplished by the rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that severe rainfall and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member in Tangipahoa gave 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.
The leader of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed by the flooding water.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were established to accommodate the evacuates.
"When the water begins to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the city of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flooding water and provided sand bags for the people who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last big flood we had was in March," Lacy Landrum said from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said that it continued to rain on the golf coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses should have been reported as flooded on Thursday, but on Friday, no report has been made until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "throughd by balls", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered several shot injurys, including in the lung, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was at consciousness during his transportation to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was hollowed by balls," his grandmother Delore's melting told the broadcaster.
I just can't believe that.
The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the sender that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims, according to CBS Philadelphia, are in stable state.
The boy was shot at the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in a critical condition, reports the sender.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police figured whether one of the offenders could be injured.
Ermitters told CBS Philadelphia that it seemed that there had been a crossfire between several shooters.
Patterns for storm guns that were traced back to various storm weapons overlooked the crime site.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the road, there were hülsen.
So there seemed to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved," said Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi to the police in Philadelphia.
There were also several houses and vehicles in the area.
There were no arrests, and the police are currently reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another six-year-old girl was hit by a cross-seater on the arm when she played in front of her house in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm presenting under the women's Olympia team in the tournament for more than one reason.
First, I have been in every summer Olympiad since 1984, and the USA have never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three towers, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, which Aly Raisman is the Jewish and rounds Madison Kocian, which is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has fortified the black and hispanese female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among female turners has been an Afro-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
During the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was an amazing Olympic winner, and America was exulting.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they supplied unexpected, but mastery gymastic routines.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-competition event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the top of this sport, but this is not how tour classes look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic Team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympia team will have only four tournaments in the team. Furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality looks like tournaments are a costly sport and tournaments are primarily in private tournaments that will be kept up by parents for the training, setup, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their tournaments and families).
The majority of these tournaments are in wealthy premises that can support the business.
In these associations, the tournaments receive their entire training and that is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started turning.
We need to allow the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to be more luxurious and easily accessible tour training.
I founded my 20-year-old turning foundation.
At my events, we offered free and affordable tours in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hypanese) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) in order to offer young people high-quality tours that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turning develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the spirit.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health and for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in turning and that's great.
It's so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.
That's such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic Gold of Mannschaft and thanks, so many young girls are motivated to start her way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistists want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 Assistant doctors who voted in a election rejected him.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract forcefully and said that the NHS was in a "Nomandsland" and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.
The first Assistantists are to receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend work in order to improve care at ingaseous times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Association for Assistance Medicines last night, informed in a communication: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will hesitate the current worker crisis and absent to treat all doctors fairly."
For only eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty, progress must be made and time will expire.
Efforts from the BMA to resolve the disputes through discussions were reluctant to participate in the government and sometimes on the silence.
This happened to the promise Jeremy Hunt had only made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift up the force and address the concerns of the assistant arts."
If he fails to do so, the Assistists have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further labour struggles.
The last strike at the end of April saw a rise of almost 13.000 routine operations and 100.000 dates, since nurses and specialists were included in order to grant doctors on the strike post chain coverage.
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to pay a better weekend wage for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director-General of NHS staff, asked the assistants to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work fighting does not reach just the few, but already burdens overloaded teams and service providers and only prepare the patients, nurses and their families to worry, need and interruption."
In the last two months we have spoken to the Assistant Committee and responded to the Ministry of Health and Other Ministrys positively to the concerns regarding the prematureness and the whistleblowing.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics, such as dispatching, flexibility in training, additional training for those who returned from a vocational expiry, training chests, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender-specific wages in medicine, was a sign of how serious it was for employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of compliance with BMA agreements in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after the authorities have recommended to administer this more people for a longer period.
The inhibitive drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medicine has been administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NICE’s regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NICE’s regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and one quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fat material in the artery walls that form plagues.
If the plague breaks out, it can cause a blood clot, which hides the flow of blood to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
If the blood clotter dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and hide the flow of blood into the brain, which causes a stroke.
Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.
The instruction draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Though availability of secondary prevention has a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or a stroke - often with desastrous consequences."
The fear of another heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By a provisional recommendation by Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness leaves election fraud bloom in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from the office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being consciously ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles altogether attacks police, election observers and councils for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to "oversensitivity with regard to ethnic and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, now an antruption king, said that the intimidation of electors from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up absent bands outside of election cabins to protect intimidated electors.
He recommends that electors conduct a ID with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter must just mention his name and address.
The report proposes to put non-remote ink on the finger of a person when they give their votes to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls on the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture, but also to protect it," he said.
The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the official mayor Lutfur Rahman should be evoked to corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a litany.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had brought his critics to silence with Rassissmus and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman should have "founded his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation, in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - with the older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to choose a candidate for their choice.
Sir Eric, illustrated, made several recommendations to clean the election system, including the conducting of evidence to prove the identity
His report says: "As evidence, pressures have been exercised on protective members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistanian or arbitrary background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had consciously ignored such behavior because of "politically correct" oversensitivity with regard to ethnic and religion."
Sir Eric expressed 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists process letter selection documents to stop "wollen harvesting".
The report, considered by Theresa May, also calls for harder registration checks in order to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choice for your ID.
Use ink not removable on the finger of a person as soon as she gave her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Perform systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are optional.
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic choice of letters.
Prohibition that political activists process complete choices of letters and turnovers of letter elections.
The police give the power to set up locks for election stations.
A change in law which facilitates a charge for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act (Volksvertretungsgesetz 1983).
Photographer ban in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensive training in order to ensure that employees are using the rule that electors are going into the electoral cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishable" that no criminal offence was filed after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The Election Court declared Lutfur Rahman and his alternate for corrupt and illegal practices because of a litany," he said.
It was known due to a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the unefficient "abhake controls" of the election registration departments of the Council houses.
Sir Eric said, "The judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of the parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and concealed spread of election fraud and leaning of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy to Kate's Radler double gangrin and other famous double gangers of Olympia sportsmen in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympiade in Rio this week were riding the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot out of the edge and band, which proved to be an impressive double gang of the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic is not the only athlet fighting gold that has its own famous double-gatherer this summer - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flimmering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain similarity with Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the U.S. team in the bow shoot Brady Ellison, left, is compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate's double ganger on the racing track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be of the twins of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the U.S. team in the Brady Ellison Bogenschießen has caused an attack on Twitter after images on which he sees Wolf of Wall Street Star seemingly similar.
In fact, the archer got the madness in the social media and admitted that he has been heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I myself do not see a great similarity, except the face hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I think I'm a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly focus on this year: the increasing similarity between the British widespringer Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with its large, expressive eyes should be able to pass through as a double gang for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimming pool Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
A move higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the inception actor
Another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-browned skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was tested by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levit".
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put in the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the likeness of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and their smiles, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in Gabby Douglas, who has their own beautiful, broad smiles that resemble Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "like a pig died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free-style swimming stifle empöred viewers of the CBC live transmission of the Olmypian games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "such as moist" and during the race as "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-style swimming stifle.
MacDonald, who had been taken to the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could say: "This little 14-year-old chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the second stage of the swimming swim at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor back, allowing the Canadians to close the gaps to China.
Watchers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane second, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "how a pig died"????
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on mission."
Ai Yanhan, from China, was described at the final 4 x 200m free-style swimming stock for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many spoke to him
Twitter-User didn't hold back when they heard how unsensible Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racist. #angeekelt.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC mission, apologized himself live for the comment of MacDonald and said: "We apologize that the comment on a swimming performance has been emitted."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry that it happened."
CBC apologized more than 90 times with the people who replied to the note about Twitter
The commentator Scott Russel had to apologize in the name of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his excuse with more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and published a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been possible to radiate them.
We quickly apologized yesterday night with our spectators on mission and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments relate to the performance of the swimmer and not to them as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron does what he said very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the mission and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad in the CBC Olympic Sending, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to them as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Purchasers in Primark displeased of women who try in the middle of business unhamed underwear
The buyers did not know where to look at when a woman went out her clothing in the middle of a primary to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she snatched the way it looked, pulled her out and put her back into the shelter.
She continued and tried four pairs of underwear in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone.
The primary store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put her back to the shelter
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she went back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a couple of underhoses out of the exhibition, pulled out her own scratch pants and trousers and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she was just there, freak like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she turned out the underpants that apparently didn't like her, as she put her back into the shelter."
She repeated the same with three further underpants before she finally decided that you didn't like anything, went back and went out.
"She didn't seem to disturb it that she was observing someone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underwear she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take underhoses home that had another person and were not washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I received, the employees have tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new couple of underpants and find out that another woman hated her and went out again and they were not washed."
A speaker of Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday, August 9th in our folkstone branch."
All the products in question have been sold.
How to protect yourself from weapon attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to handle armed robbers at a distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spit around for your robbers.
If you approach you from the back, you should turn around as the first thing, so you can see your attacker and "go out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi.
Then take the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow.
Then beat him with the knees into the bars and twist, while the attacker knocks up before pain, the weapon out of his hands. Smoke him with the loop into the face and move backwards, as they direct the gun on him.
When attackers approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, take the gun and turn it, so that the attacker can't shoot.
Put the weight on the weapon at the same time and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move backwards and direct the weapon on him.
Does it sound difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how it makes Mizrachi.
But remember, it's safest for a robbery to deliver your money - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright creates his tongue for a guide in the dirty places of Europe
A British traveller undermined his immune system and wurgereflex to a serious examination by decoding some of Europe's most dirty and dirty places.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk created his trains on a Euro-shine, a country at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before leaking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will let in.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to the day.
The idea of leaking the dish button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally dishonest, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen rinse.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he had left behind, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for testing the resistance of his intestines by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public lands at railway stations to dishwashers of toilets, the task of his immune system was definitely under a sample
In the movie, he said, "I was relatively unsorgeous as a child, as regards my health, and I put all things in my mouth, earth, worms and mudwater."
In the movie, he was definitely justified his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample drop showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
Compared to this, the number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to distract after her luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the bacteria number in different places as the bathroom
In the movie he says, "That comes near to the worst thing I smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtyer than that!
I'm not gonna hurry anything here because it's ugly in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.
The company operates Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to view and at the same time explains the benefits of Probiotica.
We carried out crazy Brainstorms that ended with saying "Let's call us Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health will become a global phenomenon
Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.
The growing interest in in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film, we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added: "Let me say it so - I had lost my respect for Ian if he had laced some of the things I had ordered him to leak, just like the ugly Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that were easier to bring Ian to attract them and others with which this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty delicious eggs on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated milkic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestinal and 58 percent, claimed that they at least occasionally use products containing associated milkic acid bacteria.
A social family destroyed before logging Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A a social family left her social apartment after a delogy with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked residents found property in an irrparable state.
The walls show up clogging holes, wooden pieces were scattered, garbage was scattered on the floor and Graffiti was smashed to the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to take into account, as this property is likely to be regarded as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is infamous and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had added the family included street fights with baseball hits, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, disputes and curses.
Skeldon, 47 whose name was on the rental contract, received an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be destroyed, old waste was found
In the estate in which drugs have been traded in the past, wooden pieces have been scraped up
Neighbors said that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly the police
Cornwall Housing delogged her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily.
The delogation was jubilated by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made hell.
One said, "They didn't shave anybody."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"Tonight we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - that's not used!
Now where they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have absurd the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overcrowded side of the municipality house, waste and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant refused to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, since a delogge is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, since the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the municipality who have come to us courageously and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and give the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress that was left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogging on the ground
Workers of the house management will now have to remove wastebergs that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash amounting to £1,700.
Skeldon received a penalty after having known the possession of a drug of class B in commercial office.
She claimed that the money was for a grave stone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were homeless, Tanya and her partner are expected to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth now.
Many rooms walls of the house were shamed with Graffiti.
The police say she will log tenants who don't keep up with the house order.
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall told us that delogging was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the house order.
"This is about those who think they can take themselves without self-destination and those who have been damaged by such a behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Panic tourists in Portugal after a deep-flying military jet beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion airplane of the air forces placed an incredible fall flight
Air Forces reported that it was on a training flight but persisted that there was no security risk
This was the moment in which fearful tourists start to panic after a deeply flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost in vivid proximity over the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The holidayers rose up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle drives without first seeing what came to them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "It flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me."
Tourists at the beach of Aveiro were panic when the plane came out of darkness and incredibly deeply flew
Today, the Portuguese air forces indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats before the coast, so deeply flying that this was the only way to identify them.
The spokesperson said that because of the bad perceptional conditions, the jet flew slightly deeper than usual, however, the air forces persisted that safety was at no time in danger.
Surface fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people were killed on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns about Seville
Seville - The FC Barcelona fights the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
In the Duell, the Catalans approach the Spanish Supercup to the FC Seville, the back game rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The dual winner must avoid Neymar in the power measurement with the lower cupfinalists and governing Europe-League champion, among other things, who competes with Brazil with the Olympic football tournament.
Goalie also lacks Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
In training, the German suffered a kneestone in the knee, with which at least the survey at Barca is first clarified in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for two years as a number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far abandoned a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first compulsory game of the new playtime, there is doubt at the Spanish master about the fitness state of the team, which was humiliated in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4 on Saturday.
At 3:2 in the sample galopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know to convince.
In turn, Seville has the 2:3 deposit after renewal in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is with 11 successes of record winners in this application.
Ma Long in a own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympiager.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old in Rio de Janeiro defeated his countryman in a one-side final and Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4,4).
So the world rankings first brought the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at WM, World Cup, World Tour Final Tower and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
As expected, the two Chinese have succeeded in the final game and made the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympia-Treppchen was the former SVS-NÖ-Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sentences and time-outs they had no coaches with themselves.
They had moved back to the tribune and left their shooters in the fair competition alone.
"The Matches until here I played for my country."
"I'm playing for myself in the final", Zhang said in a straightforward way.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Afterwards he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang only 13 points.
The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected match.
However, there was sufficient breathtaking ball change.
Mizutani won the game of Bronze against 40-year-old Wladimir Samsonow 4:1.
In his quarter final against the German European champion Dimitry Ovtcharov, the White Ross had been infringed, afterwards in medical treatment, had to "little" begun with sheet.
On the other hand, the Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become a similar high tennis age of Olympia.
Donald Trump admits ′′ powerful problems′′ in the electoral struggle
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditional conservative states, to lose their majority.
Presidency candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the multimillionary usually occurring largely and self-confident expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.
After he has thrown 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts of his success in the fight for the White House are now growing.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah," said Trump for evangelical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
Writing to be false reports about his candidature, he resumed his well-known media skeleton.
Swap Republican High-Blocations
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitors from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were equal.
Other institutions, although Trump looks ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be threatened.
In an interview of the CNBC broadcaster, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's early march: "Genauso, as I did it so far."
And afterwards, this will be "even successful, or I will make a very nice, long vacation".
He's doing nothing else to tell the truth.
If it was not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it would be fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump was supposed to have threatened to delete money to support his election struggle, he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress want to be more armed.
Olympia: Threeth fraud in Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's light athletes threaten after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a Doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that a disciplinary commission should be set up immediately in order to examine the case.
A Kianian functionary had informed that the former Sprinter and Coach, John Anzrah, had produced an urine trial in the Olympic village under the name of Ferguson Rotich 800 meters runner.
This was reported by the Doping Controllers in Kenya team leadership.
The World Association of IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to work on its own investigations, a IAAF speaker informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following IOC measures, IAAF will make an evaluation," said an IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed," explained Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was owned by the accreditation of the athletes, which was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing WM-Vier in 2015.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Light Athletic Delegation Chief Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games.
He is supposed to have informed athletes of upcoming Doping tests against payments.
According to media reports, he was supposed to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping operations for a long time.
In the announcement of the more than 2000 Doping target controls imposed by the IOC in front of the Rio games, it was unusually mentioned that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into sight.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exercised a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia beginning.
As a result, the WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping fighting is consistent with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a large runner nation.
The lighty athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of television reports from the ARD repeatedly claimed that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had put it in Russian light athletics.
It could be demonstrated that in this type of sports, surface-developing and systematically dipped.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple of love, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the Temple of Classical and fulfilled the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar orchestra under the direction of the Venezolan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he warms.
We always say she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this stage, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony with grief, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary always fascinated me.
First of all, because she is musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is wise, of course also naïve, and very passionate.
"It is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as Romans," says Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's an enormous generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Managing is a necessity for him.
You see it in every of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly active: "In this piece it is about prejudices and fanatism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York inhabitants didn't want them.
They are the same topics, and they are just as meaningful today as at that time.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl, who joined the IS, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS, reported in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's bollwork in the country, reports ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died according to her family shortly after she had planned to leave the war-bounded country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - prevent people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from East London rose to an airplane towards Turkey and then to a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that in the case of a election victory at Garland, Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garlands confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader at Senat Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dead judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected from Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokesman of Reid later said that he hadn't yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't make trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Columbia District.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination, were lakaien and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unfit for the presidential office.
Treats wants nacktkalendar for "women and men"
The Treats Magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to publish a 1970s Pirelli-inspired Kalendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
At the beginning of this year, Treats Steve Shaw's chief editor told us that his nackt magazine agreed with Oldschool Playboys, since "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the Calendar does it too.
"We have to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nakedness, where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these pictures of a female body," said Shaw in a press release for the publication of the Calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally with open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality expects mass flight
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-nahe Foundation Dialog and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects short-term tens of thousands of seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "some hundred thousand", believes the association chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the tough course of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coupling attempt, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand seekers from Turkey in Germany when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the association president Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday.
Because the government had overturned Kurdish highburgs with criminal action, 500.000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey.
After the decayed cousin, still secular and oppositional ethnic doors would be added.
Many will want to start in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that itself receives refugees produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevitian cities.
This is why Erdogan wanted to increase the excursion pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association called for the Federal Government to "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its followers".
A "hexenjagd" was also held in Germany against Erdogan critics.
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turkishs will search asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionelles.
The brand marking as a golden hanger destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and Säkulars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-nahe Foundation Dialog and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports on figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum rights recognised for political persecution in Germany.
On June 30th, this was 11.386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all asylum-authorised persons (39.625).
In this survey, those who flee from war, poverty or perspectivelessness do not find themselves.
Asylum law is exclusively political, i.e. by state, individually persecuted.
Lower Saxony: "Go where it hurts"
Funny Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals are not getting anything from the summer election fight with - and the holidayers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
They understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
In 2021 the country-day election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays again, the Swedish Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
For more stupid than until now it is not: summer holidays, heat and country-day election struggle - that bites itself.
The locals to be convinced by the electors are on vacation.
Most holidayers who are in the country are travelling on Usedom, Rügen or Hidden Sea, are not locals, so don't choose the country day.
These are practical problems: In the holidays, helpers who hang posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers, and tell voices at the end, just to drive out.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave the election fight close to the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear his office.
The SPD, since 1998 strongest party, is now clear behind the CDU in surveys.
Incredibly, how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains coalition-efficient at the end.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is making an almost unprecedented election struggle, one looks from his large posts.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and wash a little with the people, as it did his legendary wortcarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Soulring has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel blames the blooming of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "We create this" has accelerated the rise of the right populists, which is likely to cost him now the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidates, the Minister of Interior of Lorenz, has already experienced how it is when you make elections at the right place at the wrong time.
She has invited two chancellor Angela Merkel to large exhibitions; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably a majority from other federal countries," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.
But it also harms no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Nordost CDU is largely abandoning the usual electoral struggles in market places and in front of shopping centres with parasols and balloons.
That, according to Kokert, just plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that in the country you have to break away the base that it has to work hard again to find a wire to the people.
It's like the left, the SPD, the green: hardly exist in the fare of the country.
However, the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his competitors is also self-enlarving: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration needs to be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly engaged campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just close to the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had gained clearly with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, are expected to create the jump in the country day.
They make a modern virtue from the holiday not and largely move their election struggle into the Internet.
"Online election fight," it calls the country president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green electors are searching for local voters among the vacationers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just turns through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and finds it even nice.
Her impression: "Wahlurlaub in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty."
B27 Sanation: Restaurants suffer from locking
At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to mecker.
For those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at 20 a.m., there is praise for all the time.
"They have made everything pretty tricky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet tanker.
That's a super team.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be planned to south at the beginning of the week to the mid-term, until the end of October everything is supposed to be done.
It is also commended to meet those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of helping trips.
Since the construction site has been converted to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and thereby the connection to Rottenburg has been renewed, the traffic situation has relaxed within the place.
Citizens are now able to re-establish from the B 27.
Removable traffic through the place seems to go back.
"There were partially significant complaints," says Florian King, Deputy Head of Office responsible for the traffic management of the rehabilitation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherain had to fight with more traffic noise because many of the trails were searching for and more familiar with their Navi than with the shelter.
As a result, some trucks were burned in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality strongly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant overlaps," says King, who himself had been informed about the situation on the spot.
There have been two to three per minute flashing.
The fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres in the speed 30-zone.
Since the construction site has moved, it has been calmer.
For businessmen at the B 27, it is only a little comfort that the road is open again for customers from Rottenburg.
You don't like businessmen to look into the cards.
But that the B 27-saving has led them to turnover breaks, let anyone who is asking through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end customers", that is, produced for other companies, has little consequences for the rehabilitation.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline", but also admits that "the course of knowledge is missing".
The most turbulent are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to exist.
Not only him, but all the restaurants hit it "heartedly".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be glad about every euro turnover.
In turn, it counts to "wide over 50 percent".
==References====External links==* Official website
He had to leave half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has answered on a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant otherwise benefits from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation.
Göhner knows of other districts, where such a generous work was done.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
Finally, since 1715, the family company has been located here, he refers to the long history.
The fact that other frequent guests are now less frequent overlooking because of the complicated transportation, he can understand.
If you can't drive, it's nice anywhere else.
That his tribal client comes back after the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crisiss with BSE and Bird Grippe, Göhner holds the impact of B 27 building work on his customership for the largest crisis that has experienced his restaurant in its long-standing history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal already.
In the name of terrorism, it is constantly screwed into laws.
After the recent attacks, Minister of Interior de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what does a toxic status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Reconciliator.
All of his proposals are "politically encourageable to the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of the Interior on the presentation of his new security package.
They're not presuming anyone.
Other, further issues would be discussed at first within the parties.
I'm also engaged in it.
However, as an internal minister, he was located on results and on a "releasable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière has allowed a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now far more extensive.
Some things are already known, pronounced, peeled: a new security authority should take care of the knacking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU standards on passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière launches a second start for proposals that had not been made with the SPD until now: he wants to put a sympathetic inheritance for terrorist groups under punishment and kick off the German passport from jihadists with double citizenship.
"That will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still considers this to be reasonable and does not ask anything that has no chances for the coalition partner.
A few new ideas also present the Maizière.
They partly have it in themselves: he plans fast procedures for deportation and more opportunities to imprison people before the deportation.
Refugees who are specifically taken to the country are supposed to check their smartphones beforehand and reveal social media accounts for a security review.
In the case of tolerances for refused asylum applicants, he wants to make some even worse than before, for example, those who commit crimes or consciously throw away their papers to hide their identity.
Some of these are political and legally delicate.
Some things are still unequivocal and open up questions.
And in some points - for example, in the inequal treatment of patients - the question is: What is the matter with certainty and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differ between the topics of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be asserted that the Attendants of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that the people were working deeply were not allowed to be cut off in election times.
The inner security is enormously focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there's a fight for elections.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly positioning in the matter of internal security.
In the past days, between the two parties, it was high.
First, a barrageful dispute about the facilities of the federal police, then about a security-policy collection of some Union ministers in which the heads of the Union also require a ban on Burka and a departure from the double citizenship.
The Maizière is also trying to make reconciling sounds.
He doesn't hold anything from a return to the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
It's not meaningful to retrain them.
And in the case of a Burka ban he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "acceptable" for the coalition partner, it has to be shown.
There's a lot in what could make a fight.
However, the SPD is also trying to profile itself in the matter of internal security.
Party chief Sigmar Gabriel signals cautious willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security."
People's cars are still gorgeous.
Despite Dieselcandals, delivery numbers are increasing worldwide.
However, it is not all in the markets.
With the callback action, there is a term of wire.
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries more conductive in the second half of the year.
Although Europe's largest car builder can continue to show a Plus in the previous year, despite the diesel affairs, thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
However, in July, the VW core brand weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus re-expressed the total sales as reported in the Dax company.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1,8 percent less vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In Germany's home market, the deliveries rose by nearly one sixth.
Trademark sales chief Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July mainly back to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, "changed economic conditions" have been a reduction in purchases.
In addition to the situation around the coupling attempt in Turkey, a spokesman explained that the British vote had been burdened on the withdrawal of the EU.
In the United States, where the gas affairs first escalated, there is also a minus to book.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mostly affected home brand of Lower Saxony is still glimpling through the Dieselcandal: After the first seven months, only a delivery mine of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler could continue to present a salesplus from January to July.
1.3 percent more cars delivered Volkswagen at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software of exhaust testing.
In Germany alone VW calls about 2.5 million cars for re-equipping to the workshops.
In the course of the relocation, VW confirmed that the transformation of the cars has no negative effects.
After re-equipping the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power.
The car builder shall issue a "guarantee equal" certificate to the customer after the relocation, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was said in business circles on Friday.
Reason are legal feasibility.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees his German customers a warranty for re-equipped diesel models.
This would have confirmed last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
This meeting was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport.
"VW has to fully meet the requirements of my Investigation Commission and the KBA."
"Deviations from these are not accepted," said Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the warranty that no deterioration occurs in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after relocation and that all type-approval-relevant vehicle values are unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "Garanty" but not as it was mentioned in business circles.
With the wide term "Garanty", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop for half a year after reconstruction, for example, with an engine damage - and this could lead back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in customer interest to avoid any other damages that have nothing to do with the gas scandal, as it was said, that there is uncertainty in terms of possible guarantee schemes.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "Garanty".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savings - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Joseph Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or Day Money Accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal: Normal savings would "not have to fear paying for their Spargish penalty."
In stocking banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay 0.4% of their penalty.
This fee requires the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September from private and business customers for deposits over EUR 100.000 to Giro or Day Money Accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He has been watching 40 million euros for some time, which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not use.
"They are on the central bank account with me and cause 0.4 percent costs," said the bank chief.
"I can't put 4000 euros for every million."
The costs will now be continued according to the polluter principle.
The cash just to lie in the Tresors of the Raiffeisenbank would be much too dangerous: "I've already experienced four attacks, I don't have to be the fifth!" said the bank board.
Most customers would have understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Only few wandered to other banks.
The Bavarian Association said: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course causes significant costs for all banks."
It is not possible to carry them on its own "business permanently".
Some German banks therefore increased their fees for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
With penalties for deposits from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land made headlines with its Skatbank-Filial 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Business Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay covering charges for deposits, so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong."
One banker said there's a cliënt at the Tegernsee that's a bit more well-equipped by the property.
"This can be a problem for a small bank," if she keeps money free of charge.
The co-operative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
There are well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs in the region.
The Bavarian Association of Cooperatives "is currently not known any other banks which charge a deposit deposit salary for private customers," spokesman Ernst.
The president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had explained at the end of June: "The threshold to go into the negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is hard, and it threatens the immigration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not be able to like this in the width.
Destination Plates: Who actually buys sound plates?
Single men in the middle of age love plates.
Before you hurry to the comment part in order to oversee it under the pseudonym NotAllSingleMenMittlerenAlters with raw insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the widespread recovery of sound plates is not due to a tree in Millennials that wants to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are all foreseen by age 45 to 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov vote?
If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a business street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and steal wildly before I stay, hold my hands, and say something conscientiously like: "So, let us take a closer look at it."
Well, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record special shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part where I stand close to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three men of middle age) into Reckless Records (data count: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around the 20) is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I'm asking?
"I guess," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dressed out the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and pleaded.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60's, early 70's that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I probably was a little too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and like to spend their own time, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my slander.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets meet the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hip, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves to buy their old plates again.
Of the conversations I've conducted, people usually have completed around 1998 or 1999 their collection.
Customers who once sold their records to buy their CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain to the tree to the adherents of the plate survival of a particular age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business such as Phonica to recognise that plate shops provide a calming community of equators.
According to Wez, some of the older customers attacked the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted plate shells, of objects that awaken happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
This is so with me as a collector, and I think it's so with many people.
It is a simple way to focus on spiritual matters.
"We are like their social workers!" flews an employee from a stack.
A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not heard.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, as I leave through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three men medium age), has noticed a "tropheen aspect" of the revival.
"Soon someone came in here here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound plate so that I can put it into the shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it happens definitely.
More product-lasting, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who devoted almost a whole floor to the sound plates, has a bunter audience as I went in.
There are couples around 70, tourists making photos, teenage and women middle age.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drowns from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity with the customers.
None of them look strangely lonely, but nighting psychic traumas are difficult to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in business for a few minutes and considers the varietet of the plates for sale.
She's making a window bumper rather than a big shopping.
She doesn't deserve much, so the collection of plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is..." It drives off with a loved sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to snatch the Jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls who group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think to buy a Crosley plate player.
To the left, there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just decorative, some are so far upstairs that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plat art".
But in view of the fact that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one who spends most for luxury items like plates.
Although my research showed that the results of YouGov vote, at least in plate shops in Soho, they leave the large number of female collectors and plate lovers who exist in reality, plate shops and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday tomorrow with the bumper through plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plate, while avoiding the starving view of an incredible, 30-year-old false moderator that rises over the shoulders of nothing known men of the middle age.
The Grönlandhai is the longest living turtle - video report
Scientificly, the Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all wire animals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examines Haie, says that the record was located at a female from which it is expected that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court refuses to offer the cancellation of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has refused an offer from the authorities in Calais, to break down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court proceedings this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be authorized to break down 72 provisional transactions in which persons within the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drink, offer hairdryer services, or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
Calais' prefecture argued that these places should be crushed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which holds a fire and sanity risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important, since the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also concluded that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for exposing people who operate the 72 provisional businesses but admitted that the concerns of Calai's prefecture were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the food shops, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feeding people who live "in extreme practical conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the Lower Rise was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is non-profitable and offers 200 meals on the day, English and French classes, and a advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of unleavened minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian it said that the closure would be "for these children a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of those living in the jungle camp had increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steady increase of new arrivals in the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic season, Radprofi Tony Martin will not be undergoing.
"I continue to look at the World Cup, remain confident and fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelveth place on the sugar hat.
"I really find it difficult to comment on the time-driven of yesterday," said Martin.
He must be quietly analysed which reasons would have led to the debakel.
At the time ride-WM in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in recent times."
"I also have my position," wrote the three-time champion, who had lost more than three minutes on the Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday at 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund missed semifinale
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in Rio's quarter final: The world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the halffinal of the Olympic Tennis Tower clearly.
Sigmund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to carry out her impact once and worked without force compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday the medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance of jumping into the front round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (nr. 10).
Tommy Haas had taken a medal in Sydney in 2000 as the last German tennis professional.
Two German DTB launchers in the quarter final of summer games had last been present in 1992.
There was never a German duo in an Olympic single halffinale.
Group rises when starting up for live video game transfers
Looking at other people playing video games is a giant trend - of which also wants to benefit Microsoft.
The technology group buys the start-up beam specialized in this hobby.
How much money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and already has more than 100.000 users.
You can look at others when playing, but also take action on yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and face enemies and provide equipment.
The playeric Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of the E-Sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already obedient.
The staff of the start-up, which has its seat in Seattle in the US State of Washington, relocate to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and Chief Matt Salsamendi reported.
For customers, therefore, no change should be made by the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of videoplay activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased by the online dealer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's razor must be adjusted to the next generation of speed knifes: in various federal countries, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are tested which are particularly effective to transmit tempos sins.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailers of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used at accidental points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway buildings or to rehabilitation bridges with temporary tempo limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile building can be too dangerous or experiencing.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously across several traces.
Variable speed limits and transit bans can also be monitored by time, drives and vehicle class.
In the high condition you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply claused, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the pantsed and, by the way, also safe outer shell.
In addition, an integrated alarm system is intended to protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015, the Trailer has been tested according to Vitronic's information in various federal countries and is now also used.
Foreign authorities also flash with the new technology: Jüngst has ordered 100 pieces, after a order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain brings silver in the 7-rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets Gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-seven rugby came to an abrupt stop on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fiji when they were beaten at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio with a result of 43-7.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, rears, linen run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympia medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad comfort price of the silver medal - the fourth of the UK on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the best form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbleddon.
GB had a difficult way behind him.
She lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan eight years ago.
There she just lost one.
This loop is wounded, but progress is amazing.
Fidschi began wonderfully and left the attacks of GBs from spass.
It felt like walking in buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co.. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau rose in the corner.
With four more minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he transformed.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
A magnificent tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reap and there was still over a minute game time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stumbled up to the line to make a gate.
The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
It's like that.
GB carried out basic changes in the mid-term and closed the fyian gaps... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Homeova went through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long gone in favour of the South Sea Insulans, whose fans sang, swept flags and danced on the tribune.
It was not difficult to admire the gambling approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the i-dip with another attempt in the last seconds.
The pepper sounded, the Fijis embraced themselves, and GB kicked devastatingly beaten into the grasses.
Previously on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinale with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a bare half-final mattch from the race - UK's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and achieved a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the coach's cancer to robbery
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that will call something.
From the first row to the last, 220 hard hieve, who enter the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two who sat on the row, there were three votes in the boat. The echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they ruded to the second Olympic Gold in the Second Without Tax Wife, the first women in the history of British sports, which laid such a scale.
Her dominance was absolute, always her 39th unpleasant use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of tails, which does not reflect the type of triumph to gans.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference and it was no more helpful than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he would survive this day at all than cancer was diagnosed with him.
He said he was risky.
I had bubble cancer that is operating and they did.
If you don't, he's spreading out everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a little changing the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he could start his treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption at a minimum if it was at all the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so soon I had to go better.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rudering itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even larger one.
In the immediacy of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking something more than otherwise, trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was a chief in the Royal Artillery regiment in a service in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me how much Helen and I worked and Robin too.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anybody, so we're going to thank him a lot. He's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not hold.
Even in the last 500 meters when the New Zealand and Denmark teams started to join, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "keep in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to let go.
We had a good start, and at the same time we were not trying to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take an expiry for a year before it will make decisions on his future.
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, their own with the TV adventur Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I'm an olympiation ceremony.
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The Managing Director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitenstein Group", Ruppert Göller, retires.
The association is considered to be "bayer-wide model".
A small drinking water association as an example for the large water producers.
So it was in the original tone in a contribution of the Bavarian radio.
A few later, the water forum of the government of underfranken honored the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group was "bayern far as exemplary".
Behind all of this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years employed, is 28 years as Managing Director.
He was now retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group with its seat in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water each year and provides 32 places and Weiler with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current Chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was appointed Managing Director of the Purpose Association in 1985.
"His tasks have been very diverse and ranged from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, budget creation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions in weekends," said the Chairman.
As outstanding events, it called the commissioning and dedication of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the rehabilitation of high tanks (1999), the rebuilding of a central computer control (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.
There has not been any stops and you have always taken up innovations because water meant life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group to reduce nitrate in front of the Water Forum of the District Subfranken.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for that.
Rupert Göller, on the other hand, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterkeeper and he was a faithful boy.
We were an invaluable team together.
He referred to the fountain building and the restructure of the purpose association as highlights from his viewpoint.
But the biggest challenge and most difficult use were the breach of the breach at the high tank at Kirchlauter on a January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees the whole night will have to work through so that the villages could be provided with water.
Also, the supply of Neubrunn could only be preserved because the high tanks of Pettstadt were filled with snails.
The management of the Drinking Water Confederation was transferred to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who arrives in the succession of Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is openly dealing with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease had been recognized with her son, she believed she had to die.
But the eight-year-old Tiago was well forwarded and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that is back for two years when I sang on the Mailänder Scala, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection to the Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship in Bargenheide - Man shoots on life partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multi-family house in Bargenheide (Kreis Stormarn) and killed her.
"The man himself called with us and stated that he had shot his partner," said a police speaker.
The perpetrator is escaped, and after him it is open to the public.
Meanwhile, Sven S. could be on the road with the car.
The man is about 1,80 meters large, muscular, brown and has a sleeve.
Now the police have published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man wears a sleeve.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, so the police.
Whoever sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110.
The police speak of a "relation state".
The victim was the year 1988, the killer 1981.
At first, the police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about tathergang or the relationship between offenders and victims, but confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a killing delicate."
"We don't say more," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special command (SEK) was on the scene of action.
Steel - Lighting for German steel industry
The crystal-built and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional cost at millions of costs.
Financial burdens threatened by the industry from eco-flow funding are from the table.
It remains in the liberation of the renewable energy environment in the so-called own electricity production plants in the German steel industry, said Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the West German General Zeitung (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission, therefore, had first planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use gases from the high furnace for electricity production for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of EUR 120 to EUR 240 million per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with the Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, a EEC envelope of 20 percent falls.
However, this is not being raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of own electricity.
The status Quo of the previous regulation is thus largely defined.
The success of Gabriel's efforts for the steel industry is particularly important.
"In view of our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"More have to follow."
"Even in the reform of emission rights trade, climate and employment targets are devising," IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann explained in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to intensify when the world's largest producer country in China was throwing massive steel on the world market due to the weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers are proposing pricing dumping from Chinese steel companies.
During this spring, the situation has relaxed.
Firstly, import duties imposed on import steel have shown effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have illuminated.
Unclear is how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German branch prime Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Lastly, prices would have more stagnated again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, about 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July the German steel manufacturers remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced more than six percent less raw steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Association reported steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced was now decreasing the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been by two percent below the previous year.
The association expects to rise in the coming months thanks to an improved order position.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing is good
The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: As a young girl she was in school chor, in the teaching office she spent the special music, and today the 78-year-old singing in a senior choir.
"Sing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, happy and altogether living, she says.
In addition, she does something good to her health and her spirit.
For singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with the likes, describes Hackler.
Through regular association, seniors can link and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures at age are resolved, then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience also made Ursel Kip in her choir: "Take and organize yourself, rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of gathering".
Singing can be tiresome in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs does not get out of the pussy in everyday life.
Even though it is about to maintain the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimum hobby.
For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of the Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or hearing songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, people who are self-infected can find themselves of long-term events.
In singing, a special performance is also required, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a specified rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that you learn through singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-evaluation also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I do a long time for something, I get better and wake beyond me - strengthen this experience.
Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes right there?
At the search for the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
Singing someone from the acquaintance in a senior chor, you can easily join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the chores in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the municipality or the church leader.
Many senior chores can also be found on the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, you can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet research.
Anyone who likes to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.
Sing the soul does good and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats respond more sensitive than cater to cries of young animals
Biologists in Hannover have examined the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the Miauen also did not cold the males, but they always kept the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can recognize the excitement of cat babies at the Miauen of the Little.
They react by ten percent faster to sounds of kätzchen, which are in great need, as scientists from the veterinary university and the medical university Hannover (MHH) have found.
Catherine also responds to the calls of cathedral - however always equal.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the mushroom of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either unobservable or not of significance," said Biologin Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study that was published this Friday in the magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and tone height of the chicken scream differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine grown caters and eight cats from the animal keeping of the MHH were observed.
They were played for one call of little ones who were taken from the Wurfbox for three minutes and separated from mothers and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited chests, which were additionally lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the females, even those who had no own offspring, responded to the crys differently," said Konerding.
They turned faster to speaker when these calls of the very disguised chests played.
This ability may be inborn or developed with gender maturity.
"A surprise was that the males had ever responded," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already studied several times in humans the reactions of women and men to baby noises.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitive to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski takes "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football lie in Turkey.
In Turkey a warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coupling attempt, an important football game takes place in Turkey again.
Before the duell of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly stated: "Business as usual".
In the event of the suspension of the exceptional state after the reversal attempt in July, the government regulated that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coupling attempt.
This does not stop before the football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the prosecutorship issued a warranty.
Accordingly, the Sükür, who is living in America, is proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is supposed to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the attempt by the State President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the initial condition for 90 days still applies until October, it actually has as good as no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democratic growth" on public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan for the end on Wednesday.
Sports are divided into adherents and opponents of Erdogan, like the whole country.
Particularly fans of the Besikta Working Club are not traditionally one of the president's friends.
However, the strict rejection of military cracks is what the large Turks agree in view of dramatic experiences in history.
There even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether their heart is sleeping for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With Pokalsieger "Gala" it will come back to Luke Podolski.
The Cologne showed his sports value in the past season: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first playtime as a top scorer of his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce he won the 1:0 winger.
The newspaper "Famatics" proclaimed him: "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season found a reconciling conclusion for the record champion.
After the pre-runde K.o in the Champions League, the "Lives" also expelled early in the Europe League.
In the Süper Lig, it was only in rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The pokal was the only way to win something.
"We did this and this is the most important," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas, the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who set the base of the 14th title with 26 season strikes as a Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
At the same time, the Gomez, which was borrowed to Besiktas only after the coupling attempt, had announced that it was not possible to return to the country because of the political situation in the country after its EM-urlaub.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman.
However, the storms would have to be willing to give up to about one third of its annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman stated: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice for Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa cannot start in Rio.
Other light athletic siners are only able to laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The theme Doping still determines the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had succumbed her right to start after a Doping Sperre shortly before the games, was mercilessly poured out at her start (100 meters of chest).
There was a scurrile scenery: with a smile, she was still proud of the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it knew that she wouldn't get gold, the audience broke out into a jubel tower.
But there are still many other sportsmen who start with the Olympic Games in Rio despite Doping.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He was already locked two times for Dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the Olympiager of 2004 and the ex-world champion has been running even faster than before, it is over 100 metres in 9,80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered the largest publisher of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaika): The two-time olemyger and seven-time world champion had to sit a six-month lock after it was demonstrated that the painful Oxycodon was taken.
After surgery she had severe dental pain, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the olympiation gier was tested positively from 2012, world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 for the prohibited Stimulans means of Methylhexanamin.
Perkovic contends with the knowledgeal intake and was locked six months.
The four most wide-ranging swords this year go to the account of the great gold favoritine.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staffel/USA): The Beijing Olympiager and two-time world champion over 400 metres, had been positively tested in 2010 and had been locked 21 months.
A penis magnification means had been responsible, maintained Merritt.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 metres of the world's fastest man.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerworf, Belarus): hardly an athletes were recognized so many medals afterwards.
Tichon lost his 2005 WM title nine years later, after his testosteron doping was found.
The 40-year-old also had to give Olympia Silver 2004 due to steroid dopings and EM title 2006 for testosterone abuse.
The Bronze Medaille of the Olympic Games in 2008 was also known for his resignation on the basis of a judgment of the International Sports Court of CAS.
At 80,04 meters, he is on the rank of two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km of walking, China): The world recorder and gold favoritine were tested positively until May, but may still start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old world champion was found indications of the intake of a banned food supplement, the blocking of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and ended on July 13th.
Bombterror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian message in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday early.
She suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital but could have left it again.
Her home trip was planned for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the Phuket holiday island as well as in the southern towns of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens are still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been constantly in contact with the local authorities, said Schnöll.
Hua Hin, about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, was exploded in two bombs on Thursday evening.
According to police, a Thai countryman had been killed and some 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Friday early, then, two explosions went up again, according to the authorities, another person was killed.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the early days.
A taxi driver was injured by police in the detonation near the beach popular with vacationers.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a city employee.
According to the authorities, the exploration rate had gone to the air in a flower beet in front of the coastal police district.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang demanded several injuries on the southwest coast as well as Chumphon on the southeast coast.
It was said to be from a link with the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bombattatts bear the same manuscript," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday early before journalists.
"We assume it's a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives, but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize the attacks a pattern typical of the Muslim separatists in the southern part of the country.
On the other hand, the Thai police said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist rebellion movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Instead, one assumes that the bombs were laid by opposers of the ruling military junta.
In the past days, the authorities had received secretary indications of upcoming attacks in the south of the country, but they had not been informed about the exact time and the places.
Be unclear, which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks, but most often they are not directing against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej over years.
According to the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities.
High security risk (Security level 3) was valid for the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim parts of the population, unnecessary travels to these provinces will be carried out.
Increased security risk (Security level 2) was valid for the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This also gives the military a great influence in the coming years.
Junta-Chef and Prime Minister Prayer Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability, improving economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, who had taken the power in 2014 after a phase of bloody turmoil, remains beneficial to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not succeeded in controlling the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed.
Just a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a attack on a popular Hindu-Schrein - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "Idential Movement" has been administered by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several national offices, the Constitutional Protectors in the Federal Republic have also observed the group.
"We see in the 'Idential Movement' points for efforts against the freedom of democratic constitution," said Constitutional Protection Chief Hans-Georg Maaßen der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being diffused in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitary Movement" is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of your own identity by exaggeration".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identitaries".
Maaßen said that his authority voted closely with the national offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Idential Movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Constitutional Protection Chief.
Generally, extremists are trying to address them with a youthful language, often with poppe music.
This was the case with Islamists as well as legal extramists.
This is not a stunning advertisement for your own thing.
Propaganda is supposed to touch people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there were reports from several federal countries on contacts of the "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he didn't have any insights.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It is important whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its goal by certain people who are extremist, and becomes so extremist.
Therefore, it is crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodations, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But in recent years we have found that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freetaler Group.
It may well be that other legal terrorist groups or smallest groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other legal extremist motives.
However, a German or European-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognisable.
The previous groups have been created at the regional level or in social networks.
It was anxious that Maaßen expressed that many attacks went on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying.
Many of the suspects of asylum attacks were not previously known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or adherents of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that had nothing on the hat with legal extremists that might have been politically indifferent or, for example, chose CDU, SPD or Left, which then radialised themselves through legal extremist moods."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the Internethit
Not always the Olympics or World Records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimming pools from Ethiopia swim so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became the viral Internethit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished with a residue of 48 seconds and placed the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not really sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special right to start from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more known in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "Robel of the Whale".
In reference to a "wellstandsbauch" the English boulevard sheet "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only hit at one minute and almost five seconds over 100 meters of free style, played no role.
Compared with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani provided medial attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming party from Equatorial Guinea when he had to arrive in a pre-run over 100 meters of free style alone.
At that time Moussambani was fired.
The 22-year-old then learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never finished a long distance before the competition.

An open industrial trip in DTLA receives a cozy makeover
We celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Central Library of L.A. with - what else? - a new book
Geretsried - The owner of a shop at the New Place has been polluted.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her business on Monday at 17.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15 p.m., around 250 euros had disappeared from the casse.
Spurs of the perpetrator could not be found.
Video monitoring is not available too.
Trump does not see the threatening defeat of elections so tightly
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a election campaign in Florida.
If the U.S. president chooses nothing, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going to leave.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential elections in November, it would be quite unanimous to him: "In the end it will either be blown, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the candidate of the Republicans in a telephone interview with the US TV CNBC.
If it was not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it would be okay, Trump said.
He described the US president Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the terrorist military Islamic state (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance has been formed.
Post increases in the trade with electro-transporters
An electric device of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is apparently great.
The post plans to sell her electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
In a short time, the group wants to start trade with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electric transporters from the next year on the free car market.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been examining for months whether it is to sell to other companies to its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered.
Postal board Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are repeated demands, for example by craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel" the Bonner Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-owned factory, the company plans the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and to make a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're transforming the complete fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK leadership shall be deducted after disappointing business payments
The consumer research company GfK exchanges his boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of GfK's market research company showed that the chair of director Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain, the longer the success that he has promised remains.
Turbulenzen at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business numbers and the resignation of company management, the worldwide number Five of the industry stands before a personal new start.
GfK Board Chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the Arno Mahlert Supervisory Board already excluded from the Supervisory Board on 12 September.
The leadership in the board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, informed the company.
He is supposed to take over officially the function of a "principal speaker" until a successor for Hartmann was found.
As a reason for the resignation, the company called "different views" for long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not mean a company speaker on Friday.
Anyone who will lead the market research company is still unclear at the moment.
In investor circles, on Friday, it was said that the shareholders had last been disappointed about the continued successes of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK peak since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years," it said.
In view of the last poor GfK employment figures, every shareholder will be uncalm some time.
"If this would be the case with BMW, it would also do the quandts like that," it said.
After reimbursement in the pre-quartals, the company could not stop its loss trip in the second quarter of 2016.
With 361,2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent lower than the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With regard to the first half of the year, sales decreased by EUR 721.2 million by 3.4 percent.
In the second quarter, the profit has particularly reduced the value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company value depreciation of 139 million euros in the Consumer Experience business sector gave the company a loss of 148.2 million euros under the line.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had earned another company profit of 19.7 million.
Unfall - Bus slids in crumm horn in graves: Eight Injured
In the event of an accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhorn (Aurich County).
Two of the prisoners suffered serious injuries, the police informed.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travelling company from Eisenach had to evacuate its information from a counter-common truck, which partly travelled on the counterway.
The bus came right from the street and slept into a grave, as a spokesman of the police Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"On the basis of the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The firearm freed the inmates.
Six rescue cars and a emergency doctor came to the accident site on the Landesstraße 2.
The unlasting travellers were brought back from a line bus to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the traveling company.
The intermitters asked the trucker and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The charges per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Worldish Cool 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lendenberg/Lopp 3.36 Euros (up to 2.26 Euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euros (up to 2.18 Euros).
In the case of the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an overlapping calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported that during the approval of the budget, the Landratsamt Kulmbach found that for these wastewater plants there are undercovers.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plant cost-effectively due to legal grounds.
As of 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial businesses from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take deeper into the money bag.
The increases in fees are between 48 and 67 percent.
As management director Herbert Schmidt noted to the Gremium, a re-calculation of fees was necessary for the wastewater facilities of the market community.
During the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovers from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The severe increase in charges founded Schmidt that all three wastewater plants were relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenditure on necessary repairs from several thousand euros would have a major impact.
In addition, waste water is slightly lower in all three plants.
Furthermore, in all three plants during the last period of calculation, not least due to their age, rehabilitation and repair expenses were significantly affected.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged in the Abwasseranlage Azendorf due to damage.
In the Pumpwerk Welschenkahl, the almost 20-year-old production plants had to be eradicated from the ground, and at the Lopp pond clearance plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first curtained, the sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility was built to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses, the continued maintenance and maintenance costs were to be taken into account accordingly during the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly lower than the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low wastewater attack in the three plants, the costs for the operation and maintenance are "throw full".
In addition, Schmidt had left the market community of large entertainment costs in the wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for the plants mentioned will continue to remain precarious, as it is not possible to extend the supply area of the wastewater company Friesenbachtal to these plants because it is deficitary facilities.
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
The average annual inflation for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcohol beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.1%); different goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticizes as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is unsensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that is already bound to the absurd.
You can turn into an ananas, a dog or a figure that could be made of a Roy Lightenstein painting.
The filters are unblemished, proprietary tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All failures come to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past, in which they were accused that the App Blackface would support or promote white skin as beautysideal.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth, and evaporated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "Gelbsicht".
They wondered whether these repeated controversy pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.
The news and the embarrassment were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat told that it would have deactivated the feature.
The company offered an excuse: The filter was thought as a homage of anime caracters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced Rassissmus reminded the filter of injurious clischees.
Others decisively refused the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose Tweet was widely distributed over the photos, wrote that the filter "was injurious and lyingly unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the opposite transition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow view has been drawn into the degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wheel.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration campaign, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - which are more diverse in matters than their older counterparts - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive for a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and media engineer, decided to delete her Snapchat account, calling on others to do the same.
In a record for media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in setting practices in Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the large part of the white, only male leadership and finished their record with a hate day: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workplace, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what to say."
Others share their views, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but, according to one speaker, the company has recently set up a personnel responsible, focusing on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said on her side that she would have her snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."
Military management of falsified ISIS secret service information, sets the Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed postal service information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria when it would have allowed actual conditions on site, a conference investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, drawn up by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Force Committee, Secret Service Committee and the Wehrbudgetcommittee, reports of great discontent among Central Command Secret Service Analysts, who reported how supervisors changed their assessment of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information, typically dispatched by high-level centcom commanders, regularly characterized a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed actual conditions on site and were more steadily positive than analyses of other news services," cited a newspaper article.
"What has happened at Centcom is inacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the Representative House.
The executive errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows constant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government heads under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how Analysten felt to be exposed to the pressure of their pre-legislations to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Where the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the congress were far more positive than the facts corresponded," the report noted.
For example, a centcom relative publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress Deputy from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the heads of the Central Command changed the reporting services to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans brought the task force to life after they were played that analysts made anxiety about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigations.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own insights on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of disadvantaged assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff Representative House, announced in an opinion.
This process, says Mr. Schiff, "deferred the publication of postal reports," damaged morality among analysts and "gave too little room for different opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said not to have found any evidence of intervention from the White House at the Centcom Analysts on a "determined political opinion".
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the General Inspector of the Pentagon, which were recorded after Centcom Analysten complaints.
Mr Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress while the investigations of the General Inspector were still in progress.
But he also stated that "Experten sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have reciprocal effects on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic state reminds of doubts from more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece of writing about how the then government under George W. Bush, in spite of the recommendations of many analysts, foresaw only a small occupational force in Iraq and used a little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, Mr. Hooker's team, according to government authorities, notes that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refinancing of the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refiners had taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
The USA wins the fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Britain stands before
One day after she shot three gates over Japan during a 6-1 victory, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember having ever done that.
"I don't know." She said.
I'm not one of the people who keep their gates in memory.
However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic Competition and are at the same time in their group with the British in the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remains unslaught.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will gain the first and second place each.
The first-placed one will leave the strong Dutch girls a little longer in the way the other group leads.
Whatever the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising spine through their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time at three years, and had a hockey hit in her hands (the two older sisters played sport at the Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became the U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympiad in 2008, as she could not qualify for the framework.
Then came the year 2012 in which everything was wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, became a English trainer of the National Team, and it began to turn things to better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workhouse in London that we have now.
We've been able to screw the row around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close area.
India had gone into the game without victory, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and lubled the ball into the gate to provide the Americans a 2-0 tour.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US Torkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolin
Wherever you are, as late it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are constant and inevitable, a rapid seasonal race between competition and pursuits.
It's as if the Olympic Factor itself would be a burning rod, which will be driven from the armchair protector to the Swimming to the Triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue at the Coffeeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is a women's swarm with grinds for the first time in the Olympic Games, could have been under this well-known name sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he was a swimmer, tower or even feather.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Trampolin Towers.
The Olympic Flame does not illuminate every event.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, bow shooting, badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swim and let it rule for a long time.
But if I have to make modestly arguments for my particular favorite, then let me focus on the discreet charm of the trampolin.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been observed in the past 16 years so peculiar that many who, I had asked, did not know that it was a Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorant.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampolin jumping and had an athlet that has done it until the end of 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampolin jumping has a certain outside charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the uninformed ear for a clowns school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an enthusiastic enthusiasm.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous clashes of his never to end the desired riot - but also the grace of the turning and diving, the two sports that combine it essentially.
The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "spring board."
Uprising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shooting almost 30 feet into the air and have to have a number of falling movements (drives, lifts and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic Programme after execution, difficulty and "Flugzeit".
Two-third athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will attack each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straightforward.
Medaillen hopers must continue in their pursuit to gold, faster, upwards and over there, sometimes up to the destination, sometimes back, upwards and down on the playground.
They pursue not only the target line or the starting wall, but also another humble goal in the television transmission: that of the world or the Olympic Record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even touch a viewer to tears.
But it's also what I feel tired when viewing these games.
The Trampolin offers an atempause.
The vector of the trampolin jumper is upstairs.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she shakes off, seemingly difficult like an astronaut, goes upward, then downward, then hardly upward.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant withdrawal of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.
The qualifying and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00 p.m.
NBC will radiate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympia mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general.
If the consciousness can only be achieved by the angaps and the objectification of male athletes - as the male American tourners recently suggested in The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fishing embassy to be run by air.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an allies of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants demanding political changes in Ethiopia found violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that thirty protesters were killed during the collapse with the police in shooting.
Is Ethiopia just to break together?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid allies of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in the last few months protests against the government shattered the country and spread into more and more territories.
Last week, thousands of people crashed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was unbarmbly.
Witnesses reported that police shot and killed on thirty unarmed demonstrators.
Videos about the protests that are probably from the last or early of this year show how securitymen beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.
The Head of UN Human Rights Authority now calls for an in-depth investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at the remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new pendulum train in the capital of Addis Ababa.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was nothing but an example of democracy - human rights organizations have continued to undermine the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, while dissidents were effectively put to silence.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed, or driven into the pastures of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
All youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to squeeze with regard to power of governing coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rising along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this delicate, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Front of Ogade, which have been forced more or less in recent years, can benefit and rearm the turbulences.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of pre-cooking under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones became increasingly frequent and Internet services improved.
Even if the government spares access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet-proxies that hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered in protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest Ethnia in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Ethons, the Amharas, who come from mostly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that's what's going on.
"We are in coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which represent about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was 17 years of Ethiopia Prime Minister until his death in an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was viewed as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly decorated in perceiveing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special representatives to handle opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime is missing from this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unambiguous reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analytics say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a rebellion was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which seemed to be spoiled by the government and then stolen according to analytics.
During the following races, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of turmoil went relatively fast.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendulum train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal guilt of the Ethiopian government.
And she accepts a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked shops conducted by Tigray, and hatred of tyray becomes more and more common in social media.
Analytics say that the protests bring the USA and other Western allies into a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights over the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently informed that it closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to break together in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin immigration."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy around his campaign on Friday by saying that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been seriously meant by the "founder" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions on the communication capabilities of the presidential candidates of the Republicans, whether he could be able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his competitors who are trying to protect him during an eventual phase into the ordinary position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the protest at a election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump ruded back on Thursday's claim and stood in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously.
When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is falling down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling survey values on the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already introduced Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he took strong criticism when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later explained "Of course, I meant the sarcast".
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic borders in politics and then reverse if necessary.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, as they arrive, and then, if appropriate, to "clear" according to how the reaction occurs." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.
Mr. Trump has accepted an even more estimating tone as its survey values have continued to decrease.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading leadership in the state of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provoked statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is more focused on the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal fellow fighters into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him, regardless of how provoked his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent presidents, made great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back bankers, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he departed the troops from Iraq.
Most Mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to control the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
In front of the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and suggested them to drive around each of his words and to be prejudiced against him.
He reproached the " poor, sad" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't do it!".
Some of the Democrats spotted about Mr. Trump's excuse as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Once the price is diminished from the market, Café returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a delicious café in Williamsburg, where one could only pay bar that had no Wi-Fi but served for 15 years good coffee.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were threatened.
The shop Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
Indigenous, it was the last loss in a city that is renowning.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still cannot believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded, and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, it's new.
A revised verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, who is the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working with verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outsider, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment as well.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu is sandwiches with cheese and cheese, and there are yarns such as caps and saused onions.
There are natural rides.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old tribal customers.
"Many old customers were also threatened by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was at the coffee and culture in the verb that liked me," she said.
Now she drinks again coffee, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea, which is another new addition, instead of her usual Iced Coffee.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before the work and always ordered the same.
"I came quarters after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they prepared my everything basin with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he turns off his Everything-Bagel with bail, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he did not feel angry about the fact that the souvenir business took the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-breaked coffee of the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we'll still go into their offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish people Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the menu into the Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to display them soon so that his new neighbors are welcome.
The location also has further advantages.
A local juice site wants to fill and sell the cold-breaked coffee into bottles.
There is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building.
For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was tribal science and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that the entry into the locality and order felt a new coffee like a home return.
"I had to smell this," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt had a feasibility for refined delicates of the Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu this day was a little humbler: filled eggs in tomatoe sauce, potato pairs and as a dessert a plumber pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes last book "Chop Suey" dealt with the Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brickman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a home at Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear on Tuesday in Harper publishing, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless imbisce in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, chicken with potato pairs and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, the couple found it suitable for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Every foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and beans bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as a dinner.
Coe grind.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked paste for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the paths that the country used to stop being the Schlaraffenland.
"It was a time when food became a central, excited topic for the Americans," said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as excited: Mysterious foods such as bread and cassette rolls were used for basic foods that casse rolled back as "wonderful way to recover food rests," noted brickman, as cooks could hide unappeal ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Typical mixtures have been tested, as a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cuisine.
During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, brickman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunch," says Coe.
Brickmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many household recipes.
As never before or since, household businessmen - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have driven the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "Housing Policies" and the challenge of transforming pamps like creamy Spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals to be justified.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of the historic delights.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung, are tasty.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his cuisine, he feeds like the millions of heavy man from the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumbersauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost golden dining room and wore a smoke.
He was delighted with reality.
President Roosevelt may have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to stat a sample with his stomach.
As described in the book, the adjoining of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial preparations."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs.
The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said brickman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
In writing the book, the couple gave the eating habits of brickman’s mother-in-law to have understood better - for example, how she could not throw food away.
"She had a real fear of wasteting food," said Coe.
Brickman remembered: "She actually made people sick."
There was the wind bagfall.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe extracted a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plumendssert, which President Roosevelt at lunch.
"It is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a send name.
There was no beaten cream, only plumbers, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone willingly dipped a leopard into the tough, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it did not taste badly.
Coe took a three-time postage.
Like a can-do bosser, he said to his wife, "A few hacked whales would help."
In bomb attack, he was the hero of Aleppo
He set his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others life.
Now the 30-year-old died even in a fass bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group, which, according to image period, has saved almost 60,000 people.
2900 Volunteers play their own lives in order to draw people from buried houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector, showing him the world at an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the grey of war.
But he never saw himself as heroes, according to picture, said, "For me, this is the real Jihad."
"If I die to save life, I think that God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar attacked himself, he had spoken in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria.
The helicopters threw down four fass bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffered from breathing.
"We now remove the poisonous remains of the bomb, not to play children with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Grönlandhai: The oldest spindling animal is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship of Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with well a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Grönlandhaie only gets young at 150 years of age.
Smallly, the Greenlandhai swims along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes just 1,220 meters away.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to satte 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a robbe with this maximum speed.
However, this slow lifestyle seems to be a patent recept for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the specialized journal "Science" of a Greenlandhai, which could be 392 years old.
"Wickness", says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for wire animals.
Although the evolution biologist has long suspected that Greenland's sharks are being stolen.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to be observed, and eventually they live mainly in the eismer in front of the thin-occupied coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland Haie accordingly.
They measured their timing rate when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
Still, these sharks do: In the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a robbe, another had swallowed the jaws of a young ice bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the grounds of the ice cream and search caverns that marvel from higher water layers down.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now examining 28 Greenlandhaie, who took fishermen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeter was measured.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon 14 method.
This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, and the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons attempted to swallow larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments in the third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-third-th-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-thirdth-th-th-thirdth-thirdth-th-th-thirdth-thirdth-th-thirdth-th-thirdth-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-thth-ththth-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-thth-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-
On the other hand, all larger greenland sharks had normal carbon 14-mengens in their lens core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14-hour for a 493 centimeter long greenlandhai showed a age of 335 years, while the record hay of 502 centimeters is probably even 392 years old.
It was known that the Greenlandhai weekly only gets young, if they are more than four meters.
Now the researchers of the length were able to arrange a age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold of gender maturity and his age was determined 156 years old, Greenland sharks with the increase are apparently at least one and a half centuries.
This should also be the world record for spinal animals at present.
The fact that such methusalms live mainly in ice waters is not a coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old greenland whale, in whose spike was a 120-year-old harpoon tip on the neck, was also caught before Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs to spare flames.
So they'll mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep themselves warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as soon as possible as many offspring as possible," explains the evolution biologist Scheuerklein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in the double pack
The Council of the municipalities has been discussing matters around construction in the recent meeting.
With relief, the Board noted the communication by mayor Robert Putz that "in the end the marketing of the recently designated housing areas can begin".
After clarifying the question of landing, parceling and closing and requests for measurement, the sale of the lands in the residential areas of "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Bereich Binderstraße - Ausbauabschnitt 1) is nothing more in the way to interested persons.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schönau are equally addressing young families and equipped seniors.
As it was said, construction volunteers can immediately report in the town hall, the municipal council is expected to consult in its September session.
In order to also enable requests for the establishment of other businesses, in connection with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to alter the plan for area use in sub-sectors which was created until the spring of this year.
In the sub-time larn area, the commercial area already designated is extended by two parcels towards State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city at Main thus has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt is most likely to benefit from the Brexit-Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is unsure whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial business throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU-Pass they have so far been authorized in Great Britain.
That's just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced shifting jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs at Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IM, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), unites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest euro area banks, as well as other important authorities such as European insurance supervision, EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Council.
Although in Paris the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the note bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg has a large fund industry, it is worse to cut down in the infrastructure as well as Dublin.
Frankfurt, thanks to the large airport, is much easier to reach.
In addition, the city has easily available commercial homes.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine are also the rentals for top-class commercial property by 50 percent higher than at Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's corporate advisory, the city was in place seven, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris on 37th.
Even if quality of life is a question of preference, "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IM.
However, despite Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
In London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. officer decided that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to the refund of the legal costs from the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June Gilead was freed from a damage payment of $200 million for the violation of two patents from Merck, which were in connection with the Blockbuster Medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misconduct from Merck, including the Myides and other ethical acts.
When the appeal was raised on Thursday, U.S. Officer Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to grant the costs that have arisen during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to draw up with Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to the year 2013 when Gilead and Merck defended each other and claimed property for laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medications of Gilead.
U.S.-supported troops say that they have renewed full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
The US-supported troops have eroded full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters have left them in the city, said a spokesman of the group on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DCS) are currently crossing the city after the exclusion of the remaining group of fighters that have buried within the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as hostages, Sharfan Darwish informed the Manbij Military Council Reuters with the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are just carrying out cleaning work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax declaration for 2015 on Friday, which issued an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for beneficial purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton generated almost $5.3 million in speech honorars; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published his tax statements with his wife Anne Holton over the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency," announced Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a sharp contrast with this, Donald Trump hides behind false expressions and withdrawals to publish his tax statements on his previous promises.
It is common for US presidency candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not obliged by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You are on the train," wrote Clinton's elector Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax tests are not completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal to raise questions about assets, its donations to well-being organisations, his business gestures and various other links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-level Republican Trump calls for publishing his tax declaration.
On Thursday, she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations." she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that during the 1990s Trump paid no or only very little taxes for two years, and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers that could still be the case on Friday.
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election struggle.
Clinton supports a scheme designated according to the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett which would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, called on Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Industriekonglomerate has its seat here to exchange Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said that he had been undergoing a tax examination of the IRS and Trump had "angest" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax declarations back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, averaged an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40,5%.
The 2015 tax declaration of Clintons showed that only USD 100 of their income was paid, unlike most of all Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund, which taxed Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109.000.

Condoms with chiliuder, fireworks promote Tanzanias Elephant Protection
Nature guardians in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into inhabited settlements – they throw condoms on them filled with Chilipuder.
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of doing so years ago, has intensified its promotion along with the US natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzanias to use a violent four-scale method to protect their houses and harvest without hurting animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed the toolkit, we have been able to see a change in their attitude within these communities, while they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said the CEO of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include illuminating the elephant with a fake and bubble in a horn.
If he's not scared, a so-called "Chiliwolke" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, whose end is turned up to the ignorance.
When it is infected, the condom bursts up with a bubble and sprays fine dust on chipids into the air.
Usually, a touch is already out to chase the elephants.
A last possibility is a Werfer who shoots a gold - rain firework in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No Kiosk New Construction at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, St. Goarer's investment projects from commercial operators with kiss-hand are considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the request for the rebuilding of a sales skios on the Rheinufer near the Rhinebalkon in the construction was now unanimously rejected.
"We welcome new business operators, but at this location in exponed location at the Rheinufer, this Kiosk does not fit," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU group.
Jewish director breaks Berliner Hotel because Israeli election was removed after "Arabic" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unveiled a media intrusion after he told that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli choice, as Arab guests had "required".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" left his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country pre-election list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel via its own call center.
After an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "socked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it was even more angry in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have required the choice to be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were distressed and disturbed by this event.
That's really very shy.
The fact that this has contributed in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even even more shameful.
That doesn't require an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "take the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty large resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole of it a scandal.
Some undertook the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "sued" the alleged invitations of Arab guests.
"Shame you," said it in another contribution, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all accusations of himself and called the incident a "failed" and "apologized" at Lanzmann, reports The mirror.
"There was never a direct instruction," Israel did not take into the Quick Choice List," quoted the Süddeutsche Zeitung a spokesman of the Kempinski Hotels.
It adds that the country choice has now been added.
Police introduces tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of São Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate the reforms of the government for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, which led the police to use rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their disturbance over the plans.
According to the suggestions of the Governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants were seen to spray graffitits against the provisional president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in mass to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been evoked by a vote of the Senate for their revocation from the office.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran grew by 70.9 percent in the year comparison.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest on Russian companies has grown strongly on businesses in the country, the ambassador noted.
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran, while new companies are willing to access the market.
Of course, the further development of trade is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million.
The rescue was reached by supplies of machines, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan is starting from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representative issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken last year, "he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the towns of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd who have received monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses searched for: Drinking market in forest oil
A robbery surgery was practiced on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under a gun, three darkly dressed people who had mummed their faces, from the staff of the beverage market demanded the production of cash and then first fled on foot and then probably with a silver VW golf.
How much money was spent, the police don't share.
The perpetrators should have been between 1,60 and 1,70 meters, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the park deck of the Rewe market and badly viewable.
The perpetrators must be driven after the attack towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fleeed from the scotter park opposite the parking entrance with the silver coloured car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Those who have made observations in connection with the robbery at the time of action (about 19.45 a.m.) should be urgent to report to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer free time
Eight beautiful and happy days, the children and adolescents of the social pedagogical daily group/social group work of the Kinderschutzbund Nagold spent with their maintainers on their summer free time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home Hardtwuldle, the lifetime group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
First of all, it went to Bretten with the visit of the Streichelzoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special childhood in the world famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned much about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group at the Deep Sea in Maulbronn was enjoyed, which invited to jump, swim and plane.
Culinary children and maintainers were spoiled with their self-prepared body nutritions such as the acids Lattle, the Seabronn peanle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
During workshops, beautiful jewelry pieces of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings on fire and the final "bunt evening".
On the day of the home trip, the sun laughed, and the children and young people returned satisfactorily.
Haigerloch: pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The ministrants from the seal care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were managed together.
In order to overlap the time until the next romwall trip of all ministrants in two years, the Oberministerrunde St. Anna has decided to prepare and implement a multiday pilgrimage.
Several pilgrimage goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishopsstadt Freiburg, where this year a special pilgrim goal was offered this year in the light of the Holy Year of Mercy with the path of mercy to be opened at Freiburger Münster.
16 minis made of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and saint rooms were on the way.
In the evening before, pastor Storos sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrim segens.
From Horb was driven by train at the start of Villingen, where also a Münster of Our Dear wife stands and thus the pilgrim path was taken from Münster.
The individual daily tours were framed by a short impulse in the morning and evening with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis kept singing a song of specially composed pilgrim songs on crossings, chapels or churches.
The local parishes were available for the nights.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a delicious and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day it went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
On the next day, the stage came to St. Peter, which was the most challenging route, but at the first time, at swivel heat had to rise about 500 meters of height and then again be collapsed.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to Freiburg.
At the later afternoon, the minis met in the Freiburger Münster and passed through the pforts of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrim destination of Cooperator Markus Obert were welcomed.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the Sacristei and the high altar.
The next day was time for the Breisgaum entropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were characterized.
Shotte Callum Skinner stirs home when Brite rings gold for cycling
Schottlands Callum Skinner shaved last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself own. The boy sponge proudly took the legend when he crashed home to home a victory of New Zealand's favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympia gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Railway World Championships despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a Hinde.
Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the scotch that has now evolved.
Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner put an Olympic Record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand countries victoriously in the first round.
And the British Trio won the Duell with gold.
Hindes was almost back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A strategy change made a large part of the transformation, where Hindes went in a higher passage to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and fell up Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes when they rose to the podest.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We set up a Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the Triumph 2012 on Kennys and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the train after a weak start.
He later revoked this statement and there was no opposition from England's Rivalen.
With such an overwhelming victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like all the GB flags on the Tribüne like London."
We've come together in the last three months as a team.
We have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympiad.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in Velodrom.
With the form of Kennys it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seeming sacred date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a exploitation of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's what Hoy's got to do.
Kenny next takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "When he wins two other gold medals, he should be be struck as a rider."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were further good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometres race.
They arrived at the destination in 3:51.942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competitors, where Wiggins will certainly focus.
He had argued with officers before the qualification yesterday when functionaries called him to measure his body size.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4:13.260.
The GB team is relying on its strong rail bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a lot of medals.
After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were dropped.
Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of competition in Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary call GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of Portland's melting because of the withdrawal of the Energy Treaty
The future of Portland's aluminium melting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator is terminating the energy supply contract and thus lifting all the supply contracts, as the supplying energy company reported.
This step followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant further subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A 20-year-old subsidy runs out in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - directs and indirects - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there could be Domino effects, as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.
The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which delivers the large aluminium melting with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, told that three other owners are going to cancel their contracts.
The plant is located in the majority of a Joint Venture of Alcoa and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant continues to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting industry," the company informed.
AGL continued to declare that the contracts were so-called "security transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month deadline for cancellation, so that they will end in 2017.
"AGL therefore assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on AGL revenue from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its annual accounts of $ 187 million in "demand of a cancellation".
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts, "the ability of Alcoas to operate the melting or to ensure the supply of electricity to the melting industry" does not imply.
The U.S. company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even though it is still guilty of a declaration why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analytics warn about the possible closure of the portland melting in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Regarding the statements of analytics at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And for us as a electricity producer, that would not be good," he said.
More than just one Kardashian Reality TV Star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the popular September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand messenger of Estee Lauder, ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," wrote Kendall.
The enthusiasm of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video, which shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz-enkels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgot the cover of her sister and ends it with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clice-resident act almost every birthday sepisode of a child's mission (Seacrest gave the sentence, "You thought we forgot you?", with the honesty of a sign-track cinema at 8 pm in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to beat her as to Vogue-Cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for herself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a range that is more similar to a tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the forest 615 pages).
The unveiling of his cover star is so desirable that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have been sicking through before official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "familiarities that models" than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "through" model of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or adolescents today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (also if all of this applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who characterize themselves in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always anxious.
In June, the one-time Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them "the foolish pieces of the moment."
These feelings came up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.
But it seems that it's going to pass on the point of misgiving.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is a super model in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure time she's seen in the reality TV. It's probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Community law centres annually reject 160,000 people
More than 160,000 of the country’s most need for assistance are rejected annually by the municipal rights centres, while the industry is focusing on the impact of further medium-sized reductions on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three of five people - mostly older persons, immigrants, helpful workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogging and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessly exacerbated, are prepared for further reductions.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of Queesland Common Rights Centres James Farrell said that the final survey of the National Association of Municipal Rights Centres showed that thousands of people are already being rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only become worse without abolishing the federal government’s decision.
"Queensland municipal rights centres are chronic underfinanced, which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with inconceivable and oppressive debts, families who go through separation, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The Federal Government will shorten the resources by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more desirable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the General Association Attorney and Federal Minister of Justice as well as the Senator of Queensland George Brandis to lift these cuts immediately, so that people can receive the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the national government has fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal centres and their client communities and to invest the government of Palazczuk in this important work.
Donald Trump Election Campaign accused after allegedly employed personnel took a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inactivity after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun to a staff in February while they were on the way in a jeep.
The incident is described in an accusation submitted by Vincent Bordini in Charlotte's Landesgericht on Wednesday, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said to have waited for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that "it wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "trok a gun, put his right point finger on the deduction, and ramped the run in Vincent's Kniekehle," told Bordini in his charge.
After complaining at the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini noted that at least four other persons had already experienced Phillip the same experience, he stated in the accusation.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," said Bordini.
The accusation comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a call when he said to a crowd of people in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - Shoot Force Owners and Arms Friends - should take action if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton should be elected and judged.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had cracked his words out of the context and that he wouldn't stumble to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires damage from the campaign to violate the care obligation and Philip because of body injury and permanent emotional damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was not available for an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
Not responded to calls at his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: lose SPD and CDU
During the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU are deprived.
This gave representative surveys of INSA's opinion research institute for the "Image" period (freeday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could barely govern, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would therefore have good opportunities to continue to put the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party is only lying shortly before the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (formerly 18.4 percent), the AfD would be 19 percent for the first time in the country day.
In spite of light losses, the greens resume 6 percent (before 8.7 percent) in the heavy day of land.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 percent each in the country day.
In the Berlin election, the SPD of the survey claimed that only 23 percent of the survey could be (val 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the Greens by 19 percent (2011: 17,6 percent), but before the left, it is 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House for the first time with 14 percent.
By 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, however, that the pirates would miss the withdrawal in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Timelup: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a desaser.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, so it was not well in hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clever.
The built-in memory was at first eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution today.
A iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came to the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can buy the devices still on the Internet, but they come somehow from the stones of the Internet age.
But 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish cell phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit Computer Fair in Hannover as the "Büro in Westentaschenformat".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for then standards: SMS and emails were sent and received, even by fax the Communicator could be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, though painfully slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black-white screen were found.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could realize in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The wise phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns' cell phone part experienced an unprecedented desaser, was finally sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market controls suppliers who all came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere to be online, that is for many people everyday.
In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, and there are 555 million pieces on Samsung and Apple alone.
The worldwide turnover with the devices is around EUR 400 billion.
This includes the well-run businesses of the countless app providers and the telecommunications corporations.
Around the smartphone, a whole industry has now developed.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, at that time Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet Communicator to easily use everything via touch screen.
The victory of Apple began, still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the attention.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The sayings now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a natural one for 20 years after its invention.
In the meantime, every German now looks 88 times a day on his cell phone.
"We all need to learn to remove the smartphone," said Janina Kugel, responsible for personnel in the Siemens board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring innovation and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as we did in 2012 in London when we operated a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiad brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be done again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will create 10,000 new courses, 40,000 new jobs, and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of Heathrows is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blow up on the world stage.
The twofler had injustice in 2012 and they will also lie wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked to him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in spatial growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the entire GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a $11 billion costly infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - which has been elected to the world's best airport terminal for five years, up to the T2, which has been built in the middle of the world's two most frequent runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It's time for us to guide this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and ensure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and Mouse game" about display blocking
For companies earning money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to handle adblocking are equal to a "Katz and Mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it informed users that they could update their filters in the program to block advertising again in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook informed that his desktop page would change the coding with regard to its advertisements in order to detect display blockings which part of the ads page is difficult to detect.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to cope with the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-her fight between the ad-blocking Open Source Community and the surroundings has already been in progress since the invention of adblockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company for social media has joined the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study of last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people are using display blockers worldwide; nearly four times as many as 2013.
With 1.03 billion active daily users who access Facebook via their mobile end devices, manual drive out 84 percent of the advertising revenues Facebooks.
The company has noted it on display blockers on Desktop PCs, since mobile display blockers do not have any effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker informed.
Advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook told us that it would update his "display preference tool" to have people more control over their targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be anxious to new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"For users this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a spokesman of Facebook informed in an e-mail communication.
Adblockers are a stumped means, so we have concentrated on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in the hands of people.
Ms. at probably suicide on the Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call on witnesses after a woman was crossed on a motorway in the early morning on Thursday during a presumed suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
One woman sat on the road in the dark "in a despair act" and was hit by several cars, the police in Waadt said.
It is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 who was overrided by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She died on site.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police said that they, as well as every witness of the incident, would call on them to report.
A investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not taken into account.
In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policeman of negligent killing was freed after crossing and killing a man who was at the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became conscious on the street, the court took over.
The court noted that the policeman - who had responded to an emergency call - was justified and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfect exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have demonstrated earthlike conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 density atmosphere.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turning of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and still continue slowly.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protect them from faster evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turning of the Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a umbrella to protect the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution, which was previously suspected by planet researchers.
Although it was once probably inhabitable, the Venus -- over several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans were diluted and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect – the Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy returns as a trainer of the Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as a trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and led to a too low right of participation in the decision-making process of the team.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and remarked that the club will immediately search for a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and certainty," said 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
Over the summer, I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth, this is needed and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly tailored to those of the organization.
He must also have a right of participation in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14, Roy was a winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the Liga.
He led the club to 112 points and at the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesota and missed the season in each of the two last years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot at the Western Conference with five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume conversations, set out strike
Labour struggles with regard to the wages for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all dispute parties are sitting at the table for a new round of discussions, negotiating leaders said.
Streiks against the Wood Group oil field service provider were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the units and RMT trade unions can confirm that we agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will take a few whole-day meetings in the next weeks that will start the beginning of the next year to re-establish the problems.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, is a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced the rate of its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure this year.
The rate reduction of the company follows a 10% reduction for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the necessary space to come through the market decline.
Shell has released thousands of people for his part and announced plans to give up his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, since it rationalizes its business as a result of its mega-connection with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower rohelp journey, a economic situation which had increased by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Member Dave Anderson met working leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important to the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of expenditure for new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star hops of Plejades
The latest mission with Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the stars of the Plejades.
The new data helps the astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the sky and in what context are the rotational periods with the planet development.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age, and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star hop of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star sky, which came about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adult age.
They're turning the fastest.
These mature stars rise large amounts of star winds at peak rotation rates.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of an recognized star spot -- as sunspots --.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are slower than fewer massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the star hops of the Plejades are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare static qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star hop of the Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stealer rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
It's still a lot before us about what we want to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so on their "dance shoes".
In three newspaper reports, Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of Plejad's rotational rates, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star takes place
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will carry against the Tampa Bay Rays a last time the Trikot of his New York Yankees.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time all-star game participants of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
In 2009, Rodriguez won the World Series with the Yankees.
Since 2007, his signature under a 10-year contract gave him 27 million US dollars annually.
By the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will continue to act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and since 2005 he created a few milestones for the Yankees.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players are showing similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the glorious hall of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to have taken steroids prohibited between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was locked for 211 parties in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to have been the most suspicious for years over an anti-age clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the block was still reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league could even have done me a pleasure for the year 2014 because I played 20 years without break," said Rodriguez at that time sufficant.
His day-to-days also do not run noiseless.
While many baseball legends received the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," added Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and was told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy confessions from the fans of the Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the adherents sang against the Rodriguez team at the 4-9 deposit.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Infected: Weight Heber Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio cannot start because of a positive doping sample.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A victed athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh contest day, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000 meters-Hindernisläufer Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight Heber Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - right before the start of the light athletic competitions that have already been critically devised come to time.
The diuretics of hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking drug for doping substances, were already demonstrated at Chen last Sunday.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had placed the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in the predecessors over 50 m free style.
Chen has requested the opening of the B-Probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands Chen's full cooperation in the investigations," cited Xinhua from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CAS and will accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio sickered the message about the positive sample at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went into the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "incredible shock," she said to Bulgarian TV-sender BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplementary," said the light athletin.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is intended to be the EPO blood dome.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-Probe should have already been positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately announced criticism to the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, "We are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight lifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympiager in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively to the anabole steroid Nandrolon as his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both dispute the intake, but both must not start up to 94 kg in the class.
Before the start of the light athletes, especially the Danekowa case is another heavy stroke for the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Association of IAAF had forbidden the entire Russian team to an exception for systematic dopings, even the runneration of Kenya produces many bad news in Rio.
In the Swimming Sports, the former crimes in China had also caused severe conflicts between the athletes.
The French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympician Sun Yang harsh.
"Son Yang pinks lila."
"If I see the podium over 200 m free style, I want to pass myself," Lacourt said in the French radio.
Sun was also the center of a conflict with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudors," said he.
Sun had been tested positively to the Stimulans Trimetazid in 2014, but only a three-month lock had to sit down.
Data clue: So perfide compresss hackers their ransom
Programming of extortion malware currently attacks companies - and are successful.
According to a current survey of malware-protection specialists malware-bytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once over the past 12 months, partially several victims of a attack with erpressor software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already targeted by a ransomware pressure.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the solvents required by the offenders to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The offenders specialize their extortion software according to the observations of malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially expressing ransom is significantly higher than in private users.
"We are currently watching an alarming fast evolution of the damaging software," explains malwarebytes chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World".
In 2008 most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered expression software for themselves.
At first, private users were the goal, but the change to business attacks has been alarmingly fast over the past months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it is searching for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
Then the software presents the demands of the expressors.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the crypto currency Bitcoin.
However, where private users are at stake with the personal photo database, businesses are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is silent.
Accordingly, the damage is higher if a ransomware is added.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business activity completely, in one case people were in risk of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of diseases.
"We always say to the victims, don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the operation in the light of the abstinence.
The hackers know that again and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contacts with the compressors and come to the result: The offenders are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat, how to pay by bitcoin, freely accessible support websites in or unencrypt any example files.
And after payments of a few hundred euros, private people will have to negotiate firms in part and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless gains from the Ransomware pressure, the hackers become more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus Provider Sofos: "A single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four persons.
Then, in the form of a software building, the programmers sell their malicious software to the actual extortioners.
The previous malware kits were created by buying malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"In the scope of delivery is an adaptation tool that allows smaller configurations, appearance and fireing to be changed," says Wisniewski.
The compressors then search for more hackers to distribute the newly purchased software to the victims.
We live in a service business.
So one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Of course, the criminals then order Spammer with the distribution," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies who better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company-IT controllers in the malwarebytes survey trust to be able to resist Ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer sufficient threat to successful eruption, the offenders threaten with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski.
This makes the potential of damage, depending on the type of data, a lot higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new goals on the Internet of things on the corn.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get under their control a thermostat connected with the Internet.
In the middle of the winter, the release of such blocked heating could well be worth some victims a ransom.
Then if the perpetrators block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the fond, it does not work closely at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasantly, only the cockpit surface drops something.
More versatile than comparable vehicles, the HR-V is in the storage room.
There is not only a suitcase room of 453 l in high-level and 1026 l in folded back loans, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the back bank can be collapsed like cinema cell and thereby provide stove space, which is 1,24 m from the ground to the ceiling.
The suitcase room can be loaded well, but the charge height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he is supposed to do his work a little quieter.
Delightful is the daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another engineization: a 1.5-l benzine with 96 kW/130 PS.
A all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
However, the steering is supposed to be a little more direct.
The equipment does not open any wishes in the tested top variant "Executive".
The City Notbrems Assistant (works up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track stop assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as "coming objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliable.
And the intelligent tempo regulator responds to the traffic sign detection and, if necessary, drills the speed.
The full connectivity, however, is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI book are below the armrest and are therefore something to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
Anyone who does not want to invest so much will receive the petroler from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: crash on a passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because a liability is only possible in the case of dangers typical of air traffic, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Act: 18 U 124/14).
The complainant had broken a knees at the crash.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline didn't have to pay any damage to the man.
Disease: When the organizer pays
Distressed vacationers will only get money back after their trip, if the cause of the disease is doubtless to be found in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests proved to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, on the second day of their Turkey holiday, a family was severely sick of diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost all the holidays in the room.
Their illness led the holidayers to a defective clearing plant, which supposedly had contaminated the seawater.
The family believed that the journey had been inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
The complainants had no success in court.
Although the clearing system was in fact defected.
But the organizer only learned from it shortly before the complainants left.
He had to assume until then that the seawater was okay.
So he did not violate his information obligations, so the judgment.
No contaminations have been found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several guests - maybe by infection among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The State has to make sense and act determinedly on terrorist threats.
Surely our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and splitting.
This triumph is not guilty of the terrorists.
If criminals have to leave the country faster, however, this increases security and strengthens the consent of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière intends to implement the proposals until the Bundestagswahl 2017.
He also announced a further personal strengthening of the security forces, "in the middle four-digit order over several years".
The sympathy of terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is intended to improve weapon law so novelled that it is particularly difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The last much debated silence obligation for doctors is to be kept according to de Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with the medical community he wanted to look for solutions to reduce the risk of citizens, he said, in view of psychic remarks.
In order to combat radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
In order to persecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans the use of concealed intellectuals.
SPD-Chef Gabriel said: "The SPD is willing to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security."
It is important that the Minister of Interior clearly voted against actionism.
"This was an ear for the scarfmaker in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel said the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
A general prohibition of full-breaking, he believes that constitutional law is problematic.
You can't forbid everything you're rejecting, and I'm abandoning Burka's wearing.
You can talk about rules such as road traffic or witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter suggested to the minister that he wanted to simulate action and action with always new anti-terror packages.
Left party chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotte Proverbs and an enhancement of the right of residence no longer brings people in that country security."
Better traffic flow on the motorway provider
It stands regularly on the turning road - here a picture of November.
However, this is to change: the right-handed track is to be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who stand on the surrounding road every evening when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
The Landbetrieb Straßenbau verlängert die nächste Dienstag und Mittwoch (16./17. August) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße the right-by-step by 700 meters.
Car drivers can then penetrate directly from the Hammer Street on the right.
The great advantage: the traffic is arranged early, improving the overall expiry on the widespread section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group represented Münster-West in the district.
The car ride on the feeder nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.
Working days, the backstore reaches the bridge above the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.
The ground is the needle tube on the B 51 shortly before the departure Weseler Road.
From here the traffic is only one-sided through the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well three-third years ago.
The reason was that Static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary force to take up heavy load traffic two-spurely.
The long time this Engpass and the working day stand will last, the competent state operation cannot say.
However, years can be expected: because the bridge has an official residual duration by the year 2034.
For the extension of the legal abbreviation track, the national operation has consciously chosen the weaker time in school holidays because there is an expectation of disabilities.
The traffic will be carried by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural travel: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The invisible house".
The company Nima's and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School of Children's House has visited an idea of the prize-winning piece "The invisible house" of the Jungen Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by the company Nima, 19 students from 11 to 15 years of age visited the exhibition in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster under this project.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most of the young people of the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and talk little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic pictures and video animations, they had been able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theatre Münster.
The company Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Talel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming playtime in the context of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without escape and migration backgrounds between 14 and 20 years are expected to have the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theatral language mediation are in planning.
The "Intercultural Travel" project continues.
In view of the rising refugee numbers, the association expects to participate with many classes.
Rain instead of star sniffs: Hope for Weather Improvement
The weather has made the star snippet-Guckers in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a line through the invoice - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suitable for watching the sky spectacle because of clouds and rains, the chairman of the Observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see many star snippets at the sky.
The star skulls are Perseiden, who are one of the fastest star snippets at 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which goes up in the northeast.
Relaxing night: Tips for sleep disorders
In the evening, you'll go around forever, at night you'll be awake for hours, and you're not thinking about sleep far before the alarm ringing.
That's all other than relieved.
After all, you are with such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relieved.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express?
There are several forms of sleep disturbance, and there can be numerous causes for them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, Executive Board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand in general is the insomnia, i.e. a sleeping and sleeping disorder.
Especially sleeping, many people feel inadequate or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Executive Board member in the German House Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleeping disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Thereafter, organic, psychological or behavioural factors can be found, but also medicines.
Not rarely, sleeping disorder is a different condition.
"Very early wake up is mostly common in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, those who have a tape disk incident can lie badly, wait up every two to three hours and may begin to grind over everyday problems and cares, gives Weeß an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
From when to the doctor with sleep disorders?
If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day, you should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The impairment may look quite different: one is slain, tired, unslapped, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical distresses such as stomach or headache.
In order to reduce the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and up to two weeks.
There is hardly a low-night sleep medicine in Germany, highlighting Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.
For this reason, in the event of sleeping problems, you should first contact the household doctor, weezes.
It can determine whether the problems have a physical cause with investigations.
Who should go to the sleeping lab, and what's happening?
For example, for the study of sleep labs, medical doctors recommend snarching with atemaussetzers, in sickness of the day, in sleep wandering or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Don't do any sleep in the afternoon," says Fietze.
After wiring you go to bed at his normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body you wear a nose brilliant, a breast belt and a feat on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleepers.
How can those affected address the problems?
There are quite a lot of screws that can be used for better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleeping and uprising times, not too long in bed, not sleeping in the day, not far from sleeping, avoiding alcohol, and not watching the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that's not a good deal at all.
What to have the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself via Facebook for disappointing cutting off the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he took gold at the short-way world championships in Doha, while at the same time recording his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler has presented protection against his ex-team colleagues in criticism via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympician gets 20,000€ premium and a jungle king of 150,000€ should not be surprised about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, but doping controls are very good.
This does not enable us to compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look at or even operate in the subject of Doping.
"I don't say that the controls should be set up here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler should have been reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
Similarly, we should keep it with countries.
"Who can't be controlled by independent controllers of WADA/FINA for a certain period before WM/OS, can't participate," the Chamburg election calls for an ice cream.
Airport: Bands of luggage thieves arrested
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
Citizens of the Dusseldorf police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
As a band, the suspects had committed several pockets and luggage thiefs.
At 21.30 p.m., civil officials in the area of the airport of Düsseldorf recognized a band known to the police from past theft.
The two women and two men had committed several delicates since mid-July this year and were engaged in joint, working and particularly professional action.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four deeds to the thieves, which were specifically committed to committing crimes to Germany.
In total, they spent more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few Lindenbäume, between a rest of the headstone patches: The Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at the first glance, but the police are among the "risk places" of the city.
Going along the road from east to west, you pass on playgrounds, a freshly stretched kindergarten and a organic shop.
At the façade of a gray house someone sprayed "happy!"
Against a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, is already built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here.
Articles on this "driving part of the town", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.
Reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, the residents have now hire contracts, but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel had expressed itself several times since the beginning of the year for a hard action by the police against the project, called the area "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the spaces on the ground floor, the Kadterschmied, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police said that they had officially patroled for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the spot, spared parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
In the meantime, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners.
On July 13th, a Berlin administrative court decided that the restoration had been illegal, and one day later police and construction workers departed under the yoke of sympathies and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: Parents walk with children, people sit on the side of the bourgeois in front of the houses in the sun, others talk like Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergarten.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children, are mainly generated by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rentals and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a Kiez who wanted police protection against vandalizing left.
The grave, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between house writers and their neighbors, does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was a traditional working district, which has a low average income and high poverty risk today compared to the rest of the city.
For a long time, house occupations and the residential projects born from it have also been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the whole Mainzer road, all the way near the Rigas.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a regular street battle under large police command, many of the projects in the Rigaians were legalized and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the part of the city has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world: with them, residents from DDR times and former house deputies are now sharing their kiez.
This is also noticeable in the rentals, which have increased by almost 60 percent in relocations since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigas are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them of thrown discs or freshly scraped facades that were covered with color bags.
No other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason that not all neighbors view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminals such as body injuries, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the offences constitute damages that tend to meet the new buildings and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, cannot be spoken of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is critical: the people in the 94s are their neighbors who have certainly not been.
Also, the famous burning cars haven't been directly in the Rigas anymore.
For the educated architect, their road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from one another than else."
New builder has deliberately moved to the Riga street - and remained.
Therefore, it was so important for the residents to get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed all the interpretations over the district in July.
However, in the eyes of residents like new builders, the road continues to take them away: through fabulous new buildings in former building gaps that push the old inhabitants.
"These are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - there are more people living here who are not so well-dated," she says.
"I can't approve of violence and destruction."
But what should you do if someone never listens?
There's frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.
Kerstin Neubauer has little understanding for those who are angry with colorbombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
He who draws up should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pedestrian district can badly complain about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deussel is a new refugee officer
Annika Deussel is the contact partner in matters of integration and organiser.
She is also local social worker.
Since July Annika Deussel has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the team of administration at Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as a contact partner for all stakeholders: refugees, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and others.
Regine Kunde from the working circle indicates that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the own-length wollmilchsau, which has mainly a problem.
For example, some - less ridiculous than the number of demanded areas of tasks - had meant as the administration wanted to write out the office.
A administrative skill was sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in social work, just a self-minded woll milksau.
But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deussel.
Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.
The 31-year-old has been involved for about six weeks.
She has been a 50-century chair for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports actors.
There are major and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate refugees in their own or rented housings.
The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landrats Office to municipality and job centers.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto does not find any private apartments to the administration.
It doesn't work so far, you're dependent on private apartments, says Deussel.
Consequently, residential apartments must be disciplined as it is so beautiful.
So soon new containers are set up in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it's not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed stay, there are stakeholders, training centres, schools, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the farm or help housemasters, do non-profit work - and that motivated and very decent, as Annika Deussel reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
That's "no employment therapy."
But activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are weird.
So also there are administrations and honorary officials.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they were desired and welcomed in Germany.
The long term of procedures is a problem.
They need to explain to refugees that it is just taking it and that they can overtake time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who develops the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach, may not work and be unusable, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, Kunde honestly says, "now who is not doing anything". Therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.
All of this is already a "mummut" task.
A difficult question: After the recent incidents, are they afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde very clearly, "what some can call naive," but a rest risk could and would not exclude them.
But the helpers are already sensible.
These incidents are also subject to refugees.
They'd have the fear that the attackers put them in full in charge.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and honorary officials in the area and in the region must look for activities.
They always have the background that soon a new shot of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, politics is shy.
Actually, it's unfair to put them in place.
"In Urbach we haven't arrived where we could go," says Annika Deussel.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are also exaggerated to integrate the people to date reasonablely.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in distress, they need to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
