Carratha police arrested 20-year-olds after faster motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Transport police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they watched it as it left a tank station on the Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and went on on the Burgess Road before he turned down to the Buschland, where the officials lost it out of sight.
The motorcycle and a person complied with the description of the driver were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accuses a 20-year-old man of disregarding a stop signal as well as unreasonable driving.
It is to appear on 23 September before the Court of Appeal in Karratha.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of rape a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "consciously sleeping, and couldn't signal any consent."
Webster is also suggested to have raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish highland on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae appointed the negotiation date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reconciliation to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congress delegates Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil law.
"As unions die, the middle class jobs also die," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and Deputy Chairman of Progressive Caucus at the Congress.
That is why I proudly present the Empowerment Act together with John Lewis the Civil Law.
This breaching law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops such anti-employed forces.
The addition of the national labour law law in order to create a possibility of discrimination in order to organise a trade union representative in order to complain before a civil court for justice - and to obtain damages or penalties - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the further sponsors of their law template suggest is the link back to a very American idea.
In spite of the returnes to trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries across the country - Americans have once encouraged all over the world to recognise, extend and maintain labour rights.
There was a time to remember millions of Americans when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full consciousness of the role of workers and their trade unions in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers are guaranteed to unification and joint negotiation and action."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Fascism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by strong democracy.
In recognising the need for workers to organise themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause explicitly saying: "The right to establish associations to secure the working and economic conditions and to improve each individual and every profession or business is guaranteed.
Agreements which restrict or aim to degrade this right are zero and non-different, and measures which are indefinite.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chaired by the International Human Rights Commission, which designed the General Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests."
Since generations, Americans have accepted the basic premises that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union should then be protected in collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with companies and government agencies.
After these rights in America have been dismissed, it is indeed very wise to re-established the American ideal, so the working population must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labour movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By increasing the standard of life of millions of people, work has created a market for industry in a wonderful way and has raised the entire nation to unimaginable production levels.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history keeps them.
The story remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' decrees - has long been overwhelming.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and have abandoned the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force to closure
On Sunday, a U.S. courtesy temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, of which lawyers say that it probably had led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the State.
This measure, which was imposed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and to enter into force on 1st Sept., would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient's right to take a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
The judge's decision, however, means that the doctors may be able to continue legal abortion while applying such a right.
"The applicants can continue the legal basis while trying to obtain these rights," wrote Bundesrichter John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing for the Judge will be made to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the youngest in a number of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors have made more time to obtain hospital instruction rights.
"The decision today means that the women in Louisiana fail to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the State to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also covered the doctors from the two clinics which had not joined the appeal and had also requested instruction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for non-constitutional purposes.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to closure, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that instruction rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Abbreviation opposers prevent the measures from protecting women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient instruction rights, informed the Center for Reproduction Rights.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop abortion, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery for fear of its safety, said the group.
In their arguments against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the execution of abortions while their requests for patient instructions would still be adhered.
Delayed diagnostics and lack of access to the best treatment possibilities lead to higher death rates through egg stock cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put an online video home for her mother who died in 2007 of eggstock cancer.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from egg cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women in which egg cancer was found in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
CLEIN STUDY: New medicines could slow lungs and eggstock cancer
The researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman influenced the chances of survival in the diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing diseases, as well as social and economic status.
For older women and those whose cancer had already progressed at the diagnosis period, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city died with higher probability of egg cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for it.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and they are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedical services in order to oppose distances, she proposed, as a possible remedy, strengthening the service of inflated doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer at their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in egg cancer, regardless of geographic status, and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published in the Medical Journal of Australia today.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years old from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of eggstock cancer.
Garden centres regret decreasing house owners
The decline along with an increased rate of household owners under 35 years could lead to the loss of garden centres tens of thousands of pounds per year if today's young consumers reach the "kern age group for garden products" according to a HTA study, as reported in Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with their own homes spend for their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting pregnancy for parking purposes and the decline in garden size are further factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated £5 billion are sold annually.
In London, over a period of 6 years the share of home owners fell from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot move plants.
Guy Barter, head garden consultant for the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade due to rising house ownership numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also predicted a improved market situation for this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergyman Tahirul Qadri continues in Pakistan.
In the capital Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators disturbed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from PTV buildings.
The station launched its operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends it again.
At the same time, some 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a mile away, they delivered with sticks and stones equipped collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused it.
The army of the country now calls for a political solution to the conflict to "don’t waste without time and to apply without violence".
After a meeting in the main quarter on Sunday evening, the military informed: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent.
The opposition politician Imran Khan suggests Prime Minister Sharif being deceived at the parliamentary election in May last year.
The protests were escalated during the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to preduce Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomats for spying reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed the country's oldest US diplomats for information on a report on American and British spionage in Turkey.
Vice-President Bülent said that the CEO of the U.S. agency and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former American analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a main activity area for US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all the important countries were pioneering each other.
An earlier report that also had the most important secret service of Germany's Ankara in the visor provided a much more annoying reactions from the Turkish government.
Warnstreik: Liver threatens with consequences for Pendler
The networked warning strike of the lodgers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The announced expiry for 18 to 21 o'clock covers all transport companies, including remote, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.

Said the District Chairman of the German Locomotive Manager (GDL), Sven Schmidt, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main impact of the warning strike is freight transport.
The German Railway in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to stretch, so it is difficult to look at the consequences in particular.
Police Chief of Magaluf of Corruption accused
On Friday, the accusers presented evidence of extortions by police officers and employees in the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca.
The head of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the renowned Binge-Drinking-Hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was investigated by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the road where most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the accusers presented evidence of expressions by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià on Friday to the Office of Prosecutors for Corruption.
Two other local policemen were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in conjunction with the warrants of corruption and were interviewed by a judge with Navarro.
The National Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners claimed that the vetternal economy of the authorities has serious effects on their business.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Let our life base out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video, in which a 18-year-old British tourist was shown, who took place in 24 men during a sailing tour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the renowned alcoholic cubic tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour Organisator Carnage together have to pay a penalty of 55,000 € (73,000 $).
The tourist town of Magaluf, mostly popular with young British vacationers, is also known for many accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "Balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions impairs flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has given a winter surprise to South Australia, with heavy swings and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21h, another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already come down in the night on Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a bush that started shortly before 20 o'clock and caused almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided an early spring dose, the temperatures in the city fell back to a maximum of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The wet weather conditions probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19.30 p.m. but was hit by a windwind - a sudden change of wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
Windshots reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start on a second landing flight and finally set up at about 20.40 a.m.
As a result, the flight delay led to the delay of some other flights, including a Emirate flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible spectacles.
Matthies says: Highest time for big networking
Given the gallopping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech scalt centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts with an extremely familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this here, my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a reasoning behind: If the cable wasn't, in the shortest time, all listeners would flee around the house, and that would be even more significant.
After all, the ecetronic (ekeltronic) is true.
No, hint error: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow is purchased - obsolete.
For example, whoever still has a tube television in the living room today, he simply says that he is basically rejecting television.
Why are these considerations?
Because the Ifa's invasion at the radio tower this week again leads us to our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The Laie, who used to blindly dominate former washing machine and CD players today, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are distributed with an incredible ethical expert speech before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises the press office.
Yeah, are you still?
What should you talk about to people who seem to spread such a quarter voluntarily?
Actually, for about 20 years we have been talking about the need to connect our house.
So that the yoghurt himself is reordered so that the firemelder can tell us on the Maldives that it is just burning in the working room.
And it wouldn't be wonderful if we were from the office from the air conditioning on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true in the near future: We lift our clock, tell her loudly "Saugen!" - and at home the vacuum augrobot goes away.
I'm wrong.
Everything goes on to nothing less than a revolution: "The limits between white and brown goods are silent," a industry expert boasts, one can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamgarer sends the weather report and the data brilliant shows how long the pizza still needs in the oven, but nothing is useful because we stand in the stew.
We also know from the daily practice: When a new-modical device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the territories near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air protection rooms, while rockets and murmurs were renewed to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza, while the area recovered from the fights.
The start of the school brought a feeling of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by rocket infant holes in the south of Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" children's garden, which was met by a rocket, were found before the pupils came to granats from the walls and sliding walls.
"We are a little afraid, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in the Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children from our area need the return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a little funny" to go back to school suddenly.
"That were difficult times, and we didn't get out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until the war was interrupted last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad stayed in their homes or left their houses to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and murder fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border of Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian monastery granate, still hesitate with return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza, which is severely marked by the Palestinian warrior.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you will acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited ceasefire last Tuesday.
The rest of the weapons ensured an immediate end of the fights, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ demand for abolishing the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel demands a rape of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect discussions is expected to start this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2.100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to estimates of the Palestinians and the UN.
However, in Israel, it is estimated that at least half of the victims are fighters, there was no concrete evidence for this information.
On Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4.491 rockets and murmur grains during the battles in Israel's cities, most in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into provisional protection areas.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protective areas and continue fighting, the education authorities last week moved the beginning of the school year.
"I hope the school is opened again soon so that we can learn more, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl expressed himself before the Federal Constitutional Court for an end of the current NPD banning procedure.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the current prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU head of the country in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a delightful development in the right direction and a development that makes me more of the result that we are fighting the NPD politically and not the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had failed very close to the five percent hurdle at the vote on Sunday.
A first start for a ban on the legal extreem party was failed in 2003 because the Constitutional Protection also had intelligents at the NPD level at that time.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new request in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
Bundesregierung and Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
In the new country, refugees are now accommodated in tents.
The central first recording for refugees in Harburg is out of all seams.
Now the interior authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross.
The district politicians were briefly informed - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to raise reservations for the citizens and give the district politicians no way to contribute constructively to the human accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Your party calls for the Harburg District Administration to provide unused houses for accommodation at the moment.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the first recording are the storm of seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Owners in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not equally distributed over the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, told Sydney and Melbourne to drive a two-part market.
The figures of RP Data prove that the house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, on the other hand by 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which was hardly affected by state expenditure and where prices increased only by 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless continued that at the beginning of the spring, a rise would be observed for the next months in the real estate for sale, which would undergo the market "a real test".
"If you consider the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the persistent low interest environment, it is likely that the private home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts statements from Managing Director Peer Medau and asserts this to pose "like a fieldman".
The style of the university is not this, says the communication.
Thus, the Medau family had already been informed "in the middle of June of a month about the inquiry of the university.
The statement that the plans were known only in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not "premises or even decisions", but it would be "preferencies".
The development of the narrow road up to the castle needed for access is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
A nine meters wide road was and is not talking.
It goes by 5.50 meters, which is a metre broader than before," explains Pötzl.
The Medau operator's argument that their free and educational parking spaces will only be used by university students in the future, does not want to let Pötzl apply.
Zugeparkt is not at all because it can be solved intelligently, as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the residents
According to the university president, the Kidskrippe Bergwichtel, which is located on the grounds and would lead the access to the park deck before its door, is to be "not affected".
Instead, he considers "that this is not only about the children's crèche, but also about the residents at the montage of the Friedrich-Streib street and the 800 students of the neighboring real school.
So it is much more than about the particular interests of Mr Medau", says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parental counsel of the children's crab, with the expansion of the road would be entitled to "the few naturally left spots of Coburg" to "may decide the reader himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's class last week about the plans of the university.
Accordingly, the access to the new park deck should not lead over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib street, but over the Medau Mountain.
This would have to extend the narrow road to about a kilometre of length two-spure.
According to the Medaus, traffic in the park of Hohenfels would be tenfold.
There are about 2000 vehicles every day.
From the sides of the city, one did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf returns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to health problems in particular for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it was mature for several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the National Team," the World Master of 2007 shared on his Facebook page.
It is therefore going to be a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 gates for Germany in international retirement.
Because the gun-powered backspace player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on the gate hunt for a few years, he is no longer available to the new German trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelandic, who announced his framework for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf led a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have been as enthusiastic as they will also enthusiasm my long-standing fellow players and my followers.
But for my club, I would like to be healthy in the next few years, for this, longer regeneration breaks are necessary that do not allow the current double load.
The left-handed man had to fear his career end in 2012 after a fersen infection.
Due to the problems of agillising donors, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Association (DHB) with a cortison syringe that had later caused a strong inflammation.
An emergency surgery and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers do not pass a body spurlessly.
I have some health construction sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure correctly.
Some other wear-related complaints come to this.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I can't deceive my head, my body can't deceive," explained Glandorf in the interview the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be ready for a comeback in absolute emergency.
"When all knives are sweating, I'm always ready to talk," said the two-fold family father to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble as to my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go somehow.
In addition to the 2007 WM title and the 2014 win of the Champions League, he took the EHF pokal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and in 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
He also secured the Pokalsieger's Europe pokal in 2012 with Flensburg.
German economy shrinked by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have braked the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the pre-quartal.
This informed the Statistical Federal Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
In the spring, only consumers experienced the economy, while investments declined.
The external trade also braked the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual upturn, a total GDP rate of 0.8 percent is due for the first half of the year compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which first led through the Burgmann city on Sunday.
The Burgmann City Horstmar experienced a Dutch "fitzenfahrer" invasion on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It covers the largest bike tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne with their registration for the organization of this tour through the Münsterland.
Subscribed in various specialist journals, this tour was offered interested people.
We come from Den Helder and have traveled overnight to take part in this tour.
We want to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists welcomed the route through the circles Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the association home of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace of peace" through the city over the wall, where the start also took place.
The route, which was written for three different categories, led to Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and across Havixbeck and Bilderbeck back to Horstmar.
On tracks of 95 kilometres with 1175 altitude metres, 120 kilometres with 1475 altitude metres and 145 kilometres with 1775 altitude meters, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were nursed on the way in Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
The main organizer Jos ter Huerne and Mayor's representative Heinz Lölfing showed great pleasure in the success of these cycling events.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all stakeholders.
The organization has gone without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came, as the organizer had hoped, what was probably the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We see again in 2015 at hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," however, the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
Constantin Wecker's honest memories
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, Songmaker, Pazifist, Political Activist, Ex-Häftling, brought to paper in "Mong and Warriors" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought feats for thought feathers, the Munich born on June 1, 1947 wrote his memories, each chapter initiated by a suitable song.
And he is honest: From the Onanie as a gymnasiast to the store stealing and drug use, he doesn't leave any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also takes abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in now, spirituality - all that he tries to go on the ground, in very philosophical, but also very personal.
And he also explains his pacifism, his criticism of society, his political commitment - and also how he influenced not only the music (the opera lover became Soul and Rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought Lebemann Constantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, which is "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary".
Between all the high - spirited views, however, there are also short anecdotes to the earth: for example, over battles in a locally frequented by GIs or a wahny car ride, where he anvated a tree frontal.
Even there he's honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in my arms.
Didn't say "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was founded in the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
They never saw his face, just listened to his voice: "Hear up with the crack.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown when I was a child - went with him into the kneipe and talked about things like the form of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner that read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a casting in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won an insight into how life might have been for him.
It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, smoked, deep rising labyrinth with flames and smoke and plenty of smoke.
My father just put himself in the tub, and then he was slow to hear how he started singing because he was able to wash the casting of himself.
When I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him became bigger.
Still, Henry grew up as a child without his parents’s beliefs of love.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was bad at the end of her life, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop with that "I love you"?
Stop embraceing me!
Daddy, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still friends with French with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetes.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "You must be radical.
So I pulled through this fitnessding and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's hard.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short-cut bart.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been joined by the theatre.
It followed the comedie of errors, and then fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and Comödien that have filled his business life.
He began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black Imitator/Comedian on TV for a quite long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow up not only before the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient joke recording machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "slack painted," Henry launched his comedy there for more than five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish it would never have happened, but I don't regret that I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "for years award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "greatish parody of black people."
By introducing figures that both mocked and celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on the broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as the kitchen chief Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series chef!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles sprang up his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought: "What are you next, Len, because it feels like it's just as if you're just bringing up time or take a little place."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was really allergic.
I never had learned something about him in school and held him mostly for a domain of middle class, white in strump pants and a coal head in front of it.
So I was very scared of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it once.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry released 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I felt that I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had put my head right on me.
"That's why it's a serious thing, take them seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry felt instinctive that he had to talk to the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to break over 10 minutes while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can let someone else leave that.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the sewings.
This also came well, so it's like a great sign of the gods who say to me, "This is your purpose."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERNED voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really love this.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has gone through humorous outbreaks while he always imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction is somewhat dangerous from a room full of strangers.
If you're always looking for this, you're driving in front of a wall.
I sometimes live in Apollo if I like it, but as a whole I don't have as much as I was before.
I'll ask him if he's ever going to make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a start, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give it up again.
So is this his new incarnation here?
I think so.
I'd like to be an actor.
It's fun.
One always tells a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between the Shiite Huthi rebels and the Jemenite government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi hangers had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
The accession to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemenic media reports about a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called on the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened according to the sheet with a further escalation of the conflict, his demands should not be fulfilled.
The Shitic Huthis fights for more independence from the sunnitic ruled Yemen and demands the resignation of the government.
For almost two weeks, the genus of Huthi has defeated the Yemenite capital.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access routes of Sanaa.
In the outskirts there are bloody fights with the Yemenite army.
Kenya registered officials in order to impose "Geisterarbeiter"
Kenya has started recording all government officials biometrically to remove "Geisters" from the salary lists of the government.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government communication.
The government expects thousands of people to receive salary payments even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he entered his office in 2013.
At a test at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700,000 pounds) per month were lost in payments for "Geisterarbeiter" and other misused financial practices.
The government assumes that salaries will continue to be paid to accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, was notified in a government message.
All who would not do this without a credible apology were deleted from the salary list, the communication continued.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also adjusting the salary list on both levels of government - so the "Geisters employed" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal around the Art Advisor Helge Achenbach is negotiated for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi-Gründer Theo Albrecht, demand 19.4 million euros of damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This informed a prosecutor on Monday.
The application says that Achenbach was deceived when purchasing artworks and oldtimers and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher purchase prices than actually paid.
This would also make the agreed commission higher.
Achenbach bought 121 million euros of value for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years in school, 23 of which was the head of school.
From that time Manfred Judge knows many renowned Petershausen and Collbacher from their time as a pupil.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worn by his striving to see people in the student.
The snowheads are the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountain.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his homeland.
Judge was born in Trautenau/North Bohemia in 1930, today Trutnov.
As he was 14 years old, he was interested in the school of teachers.
A year later the Sudeten Germans were defeated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, we went to Bavaria in 1946, in the freight cargo.
Judge made it to the upper-frankiness sinkdorf.
Teacher education took place in Bamberg.
For this, Manfred judge had to run ten kilometres per week to the next train station, drive the train to Bamberg, crossing three kilometres across the whole city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred judge got a sleeping place in a red-cruise home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a sleeping room.
In 1951, he made the first and three years of teaching office attorneys the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken had no free school for him, he bought himself to Oberbayern and came to school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved to a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Judge in 1980 after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and in Petershausen five.
From the school year 1968/69, these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association was founded in Indersdorf, only the primary school remained in the place.
In order to escape a retirement in the now smaller school, the then Rector Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Judge became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, so the children and their teachers were able to acquire today's building from September 1982, which was extended after Judge's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Judge commends the uncomplicated generousness of Ludwig Götz, the former mayor, who, at municipal costs, had also built a workroom and during the expansion of 1997 cellar rooms, although it was not eligible for school buildings.
"Bürgermeister Götz was very school-friendly," judge remembered.
In his entire career, Manfred Judge never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a referendum of a school council on justice and justice: "You should never forget love." Manfred Judge perverted what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two ways: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "This doesn't always work." Whether he only thinks his students or just his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, judge’s doing was sometimes unconventional.
When students plagued, they did not get some punishment from him, nor were they forfeited.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had two pairs of box gloves made and allowed the two contrahents to attack each other, even if there was a veil.
For the benefit of the school, judges served a good relationship with the former mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the partyless Judge after his retirement to candidate at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
But Judge was chosen on place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4RADTOUR 700 bicycle drivers in the Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten intermediate stops
When cyclists take their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of races was impressed: The 700 participants of the hr4-cycling tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Radles and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and lived there a concert of Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists attacked the first stage, 60 kilometres over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was started with the bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the director of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of good things were prepared: The landwives from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple, dish, scratch and cheese baked wonderfully to the skilled cyclists.
"Solche cakes can only bake landwives," a participants from Aulendiebach praised while he ordered another piece.
At the drinking stand of the Turning Club Geiß-Nidda, cold refreshments could be experienced.
The "Duo Bravo" interviewed visitors with well-known melodies from operets and musicals and enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful environment of the park was relaxing.
Moreover, a man met a head massage from his partner: "The one he deserved, finally he has re-fixed bicycle chains already jumped down today."
The mayor and the operating manager were still to work: they were interviewed at the well before the drinking house of Reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
He was also promoted by Tobias Hagen, who had been a tour leader since the first hr4 tour in 2004, but was only able to snatch shortly, but he had plenty of dealing with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated, wrote Facebook entries and made reports with his staff and the 15-country motorcycle staff of the police, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhein-Main-Gebiet," he said, "but also from casting or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus, and even from many cities in the western region, cyclists are coming.
The number of participants is a bit according to the overnight capacity available.
In Category I, participants are accommodated in Hotels, in Category II in Collections.
From the resort, the cyclists had a good impression when they reappeared after one and a half hours: "See!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they sneaked off.
After the arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the government of the Schottener Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festival and, of course, they had prepared delicious eggs, such as flames with well-cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his role as CEO of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen, welcomed the visitors.
The three were clearly pleased with the "many operation in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance bush.
The opportunity to float under the open sky was eagerly used in spite of the sports activity on the bike.
Among the guests were increasingly mixing citizens who were like the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes returned to Bad Vilbel.
Thousands of Turkish police for "conspiracy" arrested against the government
A total of 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of the "conspiracy against the government", local media agencies report.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrestors are 14 high-level policemen, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the investigations of corruption against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they supposedly founded an organized criminal association and occupied telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (which was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergyman Fethulla Güllen against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he informed waiting journalists that not all schools had opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
All Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian Volksfront must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slawjansk, who visited Jazenjuks daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing chicken shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud lace from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with Bain and Co., a global management consultancy company, to which she switched to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearsons media world.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the parent company's headquarters went to a younger male colleague.
Her inventory was said to be almost £1 million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, former president of BP, when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant of the cabinet.
Your husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May, I described the Chairman's task with a poisoned cup.
Not only stands the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: afterwards on the first garde of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also on the outside as a voice of public concern and distress when things run wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol that requires a comprehensive reform.
But which new Chairman would risk joining on everything and intervening an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may bring himself to his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if it wouldn't be enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC minimised - power, money and status collapsed.
While the competition approaches and threatens new technologies of old, comfortable security, the next negotiation of license fees for the BBC is connected with special dangers.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year, the British public is certainly buying in the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: she says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pences per day.
And apparently, the BBC rises back to top at the popularity scale: 53 percent today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The look and use habits for the BBC have changed: I get news series on my phone today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that dropping Tweet was not authorized
A twoth of the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, contained a downturn on Sunday on the democratic prosecutor of the state, who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry's user account, which abstracts the previous.
Just a second was sent from my account, which wasn't authorized by me.
"I don't approve the Tweet and have deleted it," said it in the later message.
Perry's employees did not respond immediately to requests by comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually used the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unprofitable image of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, which was sentenced to tax for drunkness in April 2013.
Perry committed a Veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to resign, which led to an accusation against Perry - which may be a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweet is: "I don't always drunk with the three-fold permitted alcohol level ... but when I do it, I appeal to Governor Perry when he puffs it out."
I'm the drunkest democratic in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not charged with the management of the Grand Jury investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry claims not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal assistance asked the judge to reject the charge, and argued that the law, which is being taken against the most served governor in the history of the State of Texas, is inconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government funds to the State's Public Integrity Unit - which is located in Travis County and in cases of State corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to withdraw.
This Veto provided a public complaint from a left-hand watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he completed the election meetings in Iowa during his presidential candidate for 2012 as the fifth, Perry entered speculations that he would stop by posting a twoth of a photo of himself in the yogging near a lake, saying, "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley explains apartment market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction operators pointed out that the apartment market in the southeast of England was "returned" to a normal level.
Private homes in the capital were warmly desired and subject to enormous price increases, which, due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, the Bank of England moved to set ceilings for mortgage credits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "The market has returned to normal transaction levels since the highest level of 2013 since the beginning of the current financial year" and added that this offers a "stable business environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the decline, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Cataster Office's information, prices in the city area alone have increased by 18.5 percent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales in total.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, price-worthy and student offers increased by about one fifth last year and were by £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property in London in recent months less attractive for foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "villen tax" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which stronger credit grant schemes were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in both the real estate sales and the prices.
New data from the England Bank from Monday show a decline in the mortgage authorisation in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, on the basis of an already weakening home price consciousness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now declined by a quarter for year, according to the Makler WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due to date sales amount to more than £2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result the sales of the date have remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost one third more than the highest level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual tax result increased by 40 percent per year to £ 280 million, sales by 18 percent to £ 1.6 billion per year.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley are expected to meet the current market expectations in this year.
Analysts estimate the annual tax result at £450 million.
Berkeley-Aktien stood at £23.96 in London in the afternoon.
Nacktfotos by Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performance at the 85th Oscar grant.
Nacktfotos of Oscar prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of other 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker for "explained violation of privacy".
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were reported to have been bought iCloud in the online storage system iCloud by Apple. The alleged "Masterlist" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozen female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have taken in the private environment of our home years ago - I hope you are so very satisfied with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, however, from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" argues that it is in the pictures of her and seconded "These so-called naked images of me are FEILED, people.
Let's turn off the beginnings. *Wort game is intentional*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop star Ariana Grande departs from her the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J".
She was whipped, so it was best to describe, they slowly resolved like a cardboard that you've left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant, and maybe a little crappy.
And then shake his hand.
He knew it.
He was stubborn, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this tremendousness was a just beginning affair that had been promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life as otherwise, and may have even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremendous delicate beauty with untamed hairs and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more remote and rough than port reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion, who thought cheers for her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a wet but paradisiatic valley with the proper name Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaked, in the bathrooms were neither spiders nor naked necks had left their traces on all windows and believed they all belonged, and the garden was overwhelmed with uncrowded, which looked like huge coal pots.
It was like the house from a children's fair, both threatening and lucrative, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn on the broken loungers in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had absent into the service console, which provided the country with calming music and sensing news when the sight of their crushed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, whom his father loved to listen at closed rollers in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their harsh aggressivity, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was so right forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully overwhelmed, just as the word overwhelming.
The general taste made what had never been accomplished and how people in books chose from-teler water to-m-millionary museums, cook books and loveromans, so they chose the ballads at the music.
In the Euphory of the day, cheers began playing an imaginary piano and singing in a grob-komic serenade of Ailinn's large feet.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still young.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
When you start a word with a J, without putting two fingers on your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game at that time, and it wasn't very funny now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard what.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not banned directly.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only space for one "if" in life.
People wanted to be very sure at the beginning of a melody where they would end.
Like the mind.
His inevitability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed in mind.
Although he was 10 years old, without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew about jazz about his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, there were no laws or conspiracies.
A consistent society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of grouping - thankful as those spared from the fate.
People with afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports by temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed as from nature with electronic talent and were responsible for ensuring that no family remained without working service telephone.
What was still left of the Polish community was caring for the channelization; what was left of the Greeks scattered plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WHAT WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN FOR Bright, even fear that the flames would consume them as the next, had opened Labneh and Shisha Pfeis-Restaurants, thought and became depressive with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his skills.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn was difficult to understand how the insulting words that cherries had just shouted her could ever be shown.
Music was expression of love.
"They are not really insulting," said cherries.
Except for people whose feet are too large.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceitful sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound damping of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux but hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in her presence again.
She already thought he was something strange.
"It appeared funny to him," he said instead.
She shook unfaithfully her head and locked the view of cheers.
There was nothing else to see all over the world than her uncommon raven black hair.
There was nothing he wanted to see else.
"If you say it," she says without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're proposing it to me.
She seemed really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Not your feet right away.
Maybe your necks, a little bit...
And you're saying you hate me because my necks are too thick?
You hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick necks are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be weird, he often brought himself into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the reassuring charm that one needed to occupy the cruelty in whistle.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, cherries.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose up out of her chair, threw the console and shed the wine they had drunk.
Holunder flower wine, so drunkenness wasn't an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to be grieved, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I feel perversely drawn to you," she said...
Except I'm not at all.
She regretted him, both because of the unnecessary ingenuity of his words and the fear she showed in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She hadn't told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as it was here.
The same huge and ice - cold ocean broke here as it was on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more treacherous after DEM WAS SCHEHEN WAR as they were their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, always moved from kneipe to kneipe, ready to lift the hand against a woman who refused or laughed.
Dickhead?
They would have shown you a thick fist if she didn't watch!
They first knit - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a countergife to the nonsense love balloon from the console - they first knit and then beat.
According to Kevern, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the knocking itself already represented an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He raised himself out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt bleeding, but the wrath of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew themselves.
She looked at him as he removed - as from a room on the top floor her companion looked at him - a man, complained by something he had sworn himself.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, bowd his back, shamed, defeated, without a fight spirit - why was that a look she seemed to know well if she couldn't remember one time she had seen such a thing before this day?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
Several years ago, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, commissioned by Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked on a brief talk about the continued violence at low and medium level in exactly the parts of the country in which their reduction, if not abolishing, is expected most, in view of the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has already been done a lot, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to deprive the innate aggressivity of a people who have led thousands of wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically seen despite the highly afflicted turtles between the hikes rarely felt.
But some properties appear to be inevitable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion he continues to awaken.
When listening sentimental ballads, the population is inclined to stories of overwhelming difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the former rawness keeps the rural communities as well as our urban structures in the hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and rebellious strife at home, at the workplace, on the streets and even on the playfields.
"They have an unhappy tendency to exaggeration," said her mentor when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nuss tree lowered her head.
I have to ask, are you atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme appealed to her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feministin?
Still silence.
"I don't ask this," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a non-protective workplace.
We serve a non-protective society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely acceptable and commendable in itself can sometimes distort results as you have imagined them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "restricted" and "roh" could be interpreted by others as well as expression of a natural force and vitality.
If one continues to drive around, WHAT SHAT IS WHEN IT WHEN IT IS WHEN, as if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the country its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED writing in Flamingorosa repeated the advice given by Ofnow to the country during the last quarter of a century or longer.
Smile their neighbors, appreciate their partner, hear ballads, visit Musicals, use her phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to do," Esme Nussbaum replied with a quiet voice when she was sure that her superior had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing else than that we have not yet been as effective healed as we do ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may find ourselves again, as we repeat the errors that were only led to DEM WHEN THE SHAT IST.
But this time it's not the others we're leaving out of our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To emphasize an English suspicion.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions as "defects" that our grandparents may have committed or not.
They also go too far when you speak of having left out their "wrath" and her "mortalism" to "others".
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we speak of "our" and "others" when we understand the past, such as the protection of the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of injustice, that's all we know.
"From that, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to inject, "no part of society can claim to have done well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well what happened has happened.
That was at that time.
We don't have to say anything to that - we agree.
And just as no debt has to be allocated, no debt has to be repaid if such a destruction would be appropriate and if there was a way of cutting it.
But to what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to forget them.
If I can say something about this,
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramids assembled.
"I'll remember her report," he said and left her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorcycle driver who, as passengers described, had been driven on the footway in a kind of "brutal anger".
There are accidents.
Lesotho military member says that no state strike was planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho opposed to have planned a state strike for the destruction of the government and said that they were committed against policemen who were accused of the army of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled out of the country and informed that the army of the country surrounded its headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after he had reported an attack threat.
Military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no state strike, but the military responds to the threat of "political fanatics" whose army was ahead by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho acted after having received several secret service reports that within the police there are some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were shortly before creating devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a turnover.
"Although no one claimed that the government had snatched itself by violence, all reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho have proved signs of a state strike," he said.
On Sunday, spokesperson of Lesotho's military told the soldiers that they would relap into their barracks and that the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the governance during Thabane's absence.
Thabane told him that he believed that he had become a target for his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
There have been great tensions in Lesotho since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his unity government.
He said that his actions wouldn't have undermined the government, otherwise loud accusations to the contrary.
Production in the Eurozone on a 13-month thief
In August, the increase in production in the euro area slowed down to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a precisely observed study.
The final Markit Shopping Manager Index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An expansion of over 50 indicates.
New contracts declined, and factories experienced breaches over Ukraine in a period of rising tensions between the EU and Russia.
The figures shall be entered before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery of the euro area as well as for the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further information during this week if it considers a quantitative relief for the euro area, in accordance with those carried out by the United Kingdom and the USA during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer to manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner in Russia in the EU, fell to the deepest in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains an worried child, as well as the decline in Italy from a solid expansion to the stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism of Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer calming," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is probably the fire of the analysts that expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economic Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the shopping manager index of the productive business in the Eurozone in August is that afterwards the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producents in the euro area are currently finding life quite difficult because the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably leads to some contracts being delayed or even interrupted, especially large contracts.
He said that it would become "more likely" that the ECB should finally introduce a type of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The hell decades of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the frightening shelter of the school, as the children who are entangled in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken as hostages from Czech militia in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the abomination in the classroom.
Just a decade after the devastating defeat of the school of Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists took and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed to be the badest of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in Abscheu, and then became surprisingly transformed into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst distress.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the abomination in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war, which now seeks Ukraine - and in the children like them dying - will now end.
The girl who was photographed during the attempt to climb back to the broken school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she only tried to climb back to the broken school sports hall after a mine was exploded.
Aida was completely confused in search of her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at that time.
My legs were bleeding.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a number of operations, she felt completely healed but said yesterday: "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I have to be operating again.
Some granats are still in my knees.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help the people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she said foolishly.
"This has happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the deposit will always remain part of it, although the memory becomes slightly weaker each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, how I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster, and help not to do so again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russ go to school with seven years) and survived the three-day deposit in the poor of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me, I should lie down when there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Go up."
Full of fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying little child on the way, grabbed it by her hand and fled through a bullet hail.
His father, Wladimir, who closed his son in the arms outside, said, "Somir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality Tamara was starved outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, in their opinion that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I was crying for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir was later flew to London (from the newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from the former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror persecuted you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's gonna be blown in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy pistols right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids with whom I played in the courtyard and who didn't do it outside.
We never say they were killed or were dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I very well remember my trip to London, especially at the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a car open upstairs.
But now he is afraid of location like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamity that he and his friends suffered.
This horror persecuted you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those suffering from the horrors," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I'd like to help you so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me next year at the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the horrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence took many months.
She alive remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London wept when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and possibility of traveling to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how it helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and call them all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember he played with cellans in a restaurant. Damir shot on her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world has not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and still killed.
These are just like our children.
I think for many of the war is part of the news that they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he's not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know that he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the sports hall and burst candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember that he sometimes put himself on the sofa, turned the face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued to throw all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I, well-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for several hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around, and I saw hell around me, with lying parts everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I called him, "Damir, walk, run away," but I was so sure that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he walked away.
And that's how life continues for us, unlike that of many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrible image after the defeat became the symbol of Beslan's horror
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the defeat 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood - flooded face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life while Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbari of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, had left him for his first school day before she rushed to bring her older son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer to this date, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's long ago, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days follow me forever.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Increasingly: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was persecuted as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij wanted to go to school this day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at home in the book shelf.
I understand this, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People are constantly studying such tragedies and never knowing the truth.
And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes a bit horrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does this happen?
Ten years are nothing of such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and feared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I'm always going to the sports hall when 1 September gets closer.
I want to be my old childhood friend tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel as a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not gonna forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life continues.
I completed school this year and visit a medical university in Wladikawkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived even though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was assembled at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel it would have been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but because of his health damage due to the deposit could not do so.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say, that's not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - in the year afterwards - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there and ask me not to show you where I've been sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the deposit on the laptop
My pain is hard and I'll wear him with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my hurt knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's secret service Academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, also the medical ones, and they answered that it wasn't possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never report my experience to my children.
Children should not know anything about this, and of course they should not experience it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets closer.
I'm gonna go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much stronger for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn from it.
It's staying in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that if something so unfair hurts.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't take part because of his knees.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but he can't run a sport.
I'd say he'd overcome the horror at 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed at the siege, and that only strengthens my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and I was expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is crying for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It is hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want it.
I'm never going to forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe that.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we're fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still killed.
If only we could take and throw all these rebels out - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was carried in safety so vigorously by a special use command
Gerettet: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special use command (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty
The world held the breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was worn in the arms of a Russian policeman from Beslan's siege.
The terrorists let them go, but in her cruelness her 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar returned to the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous battle.
Her father Ruslan has married again since then and has a little girl with his new wife, Swetlana, who he has named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that raise up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both to have $300.
I have taken these photos at a family festival with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $ 350.
Depending on the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery box and other boxes are closed.
Also set your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorder have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the dimful underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Find in our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not fold.
Point-and-shoot cameras have a LCD that allows you to compose images, Action Cams normally not.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to watch this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you're doing a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a series mode with which a series of shots are made with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
So if possible, you stay close to the surface when you make photographs in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is especially important when you work with an action cam: These devices often have a solid wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame of image.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As anaesthesia doctor, he devoted his career to save both the agonie of the disease and the pains of treatment to the sick.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 worker who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnosis and diseases are important to the doctors, while the treated people are mainly busy with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble raising myself.
While fighting with the grip-like symptoms, he noticed that he made impatient accusations of his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather want everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and uncomfortable.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct a X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray investigation was available.
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an unhealthy cancer that attacks the breastfell, which attacks the lungs overly skin.
As with most cancer diseases, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers have suffered from lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smoking earlier.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which once was considered "wonder material" but has been now considered fatal.
For most of us, Mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Finally, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has been no longer used in the United Kingdom since the 1960s, as the industry voluntarily committed to no longer using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - clepper, construction workers, roommen and yard workers.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems hardly worrying today.
But this self - satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems, today experiences the highlight of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease as in traffic accidents.
Yearly figures of mesotheliomades since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we now experience the fatal effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 all asbestos types have been banned), is that a mesothelioma is only developing after decades.
And the fragile of the Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbest was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial limits, professions or ages.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shops in London to private schools, are not a protective area.
Parliament's buildings are asbestos infected.
Even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to be healed, this deadly carcinogen has already been made as a source of this carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a clamper either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with Asbest.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, a lot of asbestos was present," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and patrons - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"From the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital, and who have been sick of Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who still lives."
How many of us are still sick?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
That was an unusual long survival period.
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomarks die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us will still be sick?"
The leading expert in the UK on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if asbestos epidemic is expected to come into existence in the UK, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be victimized.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like that.

A brief look at the files of the courts to which the persons concerned often address themselves for damage claims shows how far the pest of the mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer admitted, for example, that Janice Allen was abusively exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she started her activity at M&S.
Now she has two children in the 20s.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even know anything about Asbest.
I never thought that would ever affect me.
There are only few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term Asbest refers not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name touches from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as a white asbestos, is the most common found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe risolations, boile risolation, even for brake drills in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos but is still considered by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with a possible consequence of death.
But more dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Great Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it gives clear but indirect indications that this was a main reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomrates."
A staff of Marks & Spencer was exposed at the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street, London, Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliom sacrifice, but Julian Peto's work suggests that their history is not unusual.
He has presented a study of the affected, which shows that "a substantial proportion of the mesotheliomas without known suspension by work or in the home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one could expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed unawarely to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service powers and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be thrown up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service stated that the Westminster Palace had received a "saubere health certificate", it is now indispensable that £ 1 billion must be spent over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that, after the general elections in 2015, the Members will probably meet more in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled according to the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do is wait.
A person who could never know exactly how to contact asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital where asbestos complaint was decided positively," he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've worked on and the data.
What he remembered is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45 and was just running a surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had shake frost.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I didn't make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pains of the breastfell, which touched the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprising doctors made X-ray shots of his chest and either put Pleurakat on to extract liquid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient came abortion with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was older for several decades and had worked directly with Asbest.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition was deteriorated and his household doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest.
I'm a optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
Honestly, I didn't worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year in the week: "It was told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos isolation in hospitals were below the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who changed from one building in pedestrian tunnels to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or at underground cantines (such as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely to contact the toxic substances.
It appears that over several decades after the war hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their bulb burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its fabulous isolating and flaming properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have placed their bulbs on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is often addressed on websites.
And there are such innocent objects in our houses, such as floor plates or shoe roofs, that standardly contain asbestos.
"It is an industrial gift that is included in large parts of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his process against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a woman concerned was the breakdown of a garden puppy in the 1970s.
So look at how to cut off your garden puppies.
The impact of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealthy is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas festival.
With the greatest difficulty, the change in perspective was from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he recalls how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very hard to take up all this," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience any other Christmas festival.
It was then."
Mesotheliom is particularly tremendous because it is our lifekeeping mechanism - breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is collapsed and the fibers are inhaled, they can be found in the breastfell, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled nadel-shaped fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who changed to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital, of which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed it to the asbestos, is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their hospital training.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lungs tissue, Treasure says, "they will be pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancer diseases do not work so well in Mesotheliom.
The efficacy of surgery, for example, is hot controversial.
Some think she's worth an attempt.
Treasure neglects that.
"You can't cut the chest out," he says.
They don't get around with the knife.
Thus, the cancer "not very well addresses chemotherapy," which shows "effect," but does not heal.
"Some times there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consultancy office for fellow persons four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he gladly presented himself at calls.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed "to make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-Thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not to be relocated, I just called and got an appointment," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is decisive for mesothelioma-adults to be able to observe the best available therapies.
But if these treatments are inevitably failing, many affected people are of another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the judgments in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that one realized that also a very low health risk posed.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally contributed to their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "compensive compensation" since Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact on Guy's.
After his death investigation, however, a Guy's spokesperson confirmed that "the asbestos fibers were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbest
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma-adults who strive to compensate, to assign to the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the accusers.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesothelioma-related persons to claim compensation even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a £ 350 million fund supported by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact, but nobody can claim.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 percent of what a court could have said in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 pounds.
Approximately 300 successful applications in the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks as many Mesothelioms affected that £ 350 million represented a "very good work" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and he suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time had not passed over and Mesotheliom-adulter could find the companies and normally complain them.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven death victims a quick action was necessary daily.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom law in December of last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy with which long-lastunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent for five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course with the most important," says Abbott.
It's always seen in patients.
There's something that lets you go on.
If you give up, you're getting worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went under operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I was just 50 years old.
That's not life-threatening.
That's a lifebound.
Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of tumors is visible anymore.
But the process is physically and psychically very enthusiastic.
You have to think of practical things - about the money, if I am no longer, for example, or my wife shows how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad messages, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents, that's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I wouldn't be old.
They responded very differently.
Tamsin is very social and unstume.
She told her friends and soon we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reluctant.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to deal with.
But for Mesothelio notes such conversations have not passed through hope, not from a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as finally also for Stephen Jay Gould) brings an angry security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong's right to government election, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased call for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This procedure probably fires the long protests announced in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led the planning and mobilisation to this within a few hours after the proclamation.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-peking-faithful candidates in principle.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lauu, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-general Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the control over Hong Kong returned to the Chinese, Beijing promised to let the inhabitants choose the government presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership maintains the expiry by a closely controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates should be allowed "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer where some of the largest and most publicly effective protests took place in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to dispose of the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine general right to vote.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central adherents had gathered in the rain in front of the headquarters of the government in Hong Kong within a few hours after the pronouncement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement reached a new level of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make further information to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers informed that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action that should take place only if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the Announcement of Beijings for days, and there were increased security measures, including police forces and barricades, on Sunday before the government building.
The turmoil is strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.
The accession of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to break down under the growing pressure of Beijings.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central Movement, as it threatened the business operation - the lifestyles of Hong Kong.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has criticized the movement for a long time.
We don't want to shrink fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media have also recently reported on the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western forces.
This summer, activists organized an inofficial referendum on the rights of elections in which 780,000 people participated - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school closure balls in the USA is now transferred to the universities where Freshmen is offered performances with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxurious travel service for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who, otherwise, have to kick their possessions in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to this year to ensure that the students reach the university with a minimum effort and a maximum of luxury.
One company speaker said that no new bookings were made since the service had just been introduced, but added that "Students would book the service in the next weeks".
The company also informed that, despite the study fees of £9,000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today differ very much from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as aborted.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems totally separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start the study this month are exposed to a crisis of lifekeeping costs, as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and scholarships do not take step with the strongly rising invoices for the simplest life bases before they can even remember spending thousands of pounds for something simple as the arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticise racial question and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants threw their hands into the air and sang, "Hans up, not shooting," while waiting before the funeral.
After two-week protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the gender in front of the race when it comes to addressing reproduction law and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers from white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared with the answers from black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "Thinks to Ferguson from a white woman" and "Feminism are not only about the oppression of women" were relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism you find many people who are about white and talk privileges in such high-class manner," she said.
People felt forced to express something to the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so etnized that they must express this.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University Ferguson revealed problems that are exposed to black Americans every day but not considered "frauenthemes" in the cultural area.
"I can publish something fun on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colory in their own country is under custody, the silence is oring.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the subjects race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"At the age of 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were aligned and the reasoning was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point at which white fighters for women's election law such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for the right of election could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to take action for women's election law, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
If you remember such things, you become aware of power, why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade until white women organized themselves against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group developed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminist women played "fangs" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Is it not great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to education a child as seriously as they do with the right to control the reception?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who build their careers in the struggle for reproduction rights and access to preventive resources, now try to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a risk in the body - and opinions on the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will introduce the changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism, in which racial and gender themes are addressed, some of their comments on racial theme in America are astonished.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently opened a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and hispanese men, there were angry reactions from many feminist women, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police has attacked almost 63,000 unmatched minors at the southwestern border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform also goes back to the surface - this time as a woman's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-president of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for the immigration reform, said that for a re-examine of the topic as an essential theme of women, she only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large number of labour visas go to male immigrants, women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a posthall in the women's organizations," she said.
"Swine House" in Ipswich stands for sale
The picture of a house standing for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig that it had made comfortable in the living room.
The freed house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - one of which also belonged to a pig that his head had embedded on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo was misrepresented, however, and was now removed," said a spokesman of the company.
In the Exposé of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique one-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The house sales provided interest in the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lotto win
A lotto player from Harvey is running this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth takes on, with a happy winner who receives almost $1 million from the lottery training on Saturday.
A newspaper skiosk in Harvey for the second time in five years moved the jackpot in the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
The happy winner, however, still has to report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit cares for conversational material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city talks about nothing else, and all are quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could enter.
Eight WA winners have celebrated profits in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had achieved the mega profit of $7.5 million only a few weeks earlier.
The winner had played for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with almost 85 million dollars.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only were the gladiators at the first Rhinebacher Roman day in the recreational park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who undertook the rainsaw and the herbish cold and left themselves freely enthusiastic by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of representations, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter troop from the Gladiatorenschule "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust battle art in the soft sand-prepared arena.
Gladiator's owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and skillful presenter and sent his men in the ring to the heroic twin fight in various gladiator holes.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with rectangular shield and short swim as well as leg skiing on the left leg and armchair on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with breast plate, short-shadowed and wormlanze, as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", which came with a gun network, drift bag and dolch against the "secutor" and after a short struggle hit the bursts to the ground.
Since the swords drew metallic to each other, the shields shattered and the swamps flew through the arena that anxiety and bange could become for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular arbitrary judge, had an eye always attentive.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of Roman times experience," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friendskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation from the recreational park for one day, a "oppidum Romanum" became a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage found in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest into our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
The rest of it was also to be admired during the Roman day, such as "Aquäduduct marble" of the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman channel bridge, which was once standing at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus society once faced the water and energy supply, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time."
This also confirms diploma measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, which presented measurement instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocauste, the warm air heating, which once warmed the Roman villa.
Incredible also the footprints left by wolf and fox two thousand years ago in the footsteps of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Bodendenkmalpflege had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park North in Rheinbach.
You have found converting walls of an economic building with a darr to dry cereals and meals.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, explained Archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass violet, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, as well as parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the Germans crashed in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
The children also worked with the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s milling game, or as once the Roman students wrote their names with metal valves on wax boards.
At the stand of the Roman thermals Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, bastles at the stand of the Glass Museum Rheinbach Glassmosaiken and use a heavy wheat mill from stone at the stand of the nature center Eifel Nettersheim to meal the flavor for a flavor or a museli.
With the originally rebuilt Roman cars drawn by two cold blossoms, the visitors passed through the leisure park and also passed by the impressive state of the urban gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Romer Weeks of Project".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter into the 2014 Roman year of Rhineland, which is intended to remind of the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations, as well as the Wachtberger Wanderverein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a talk, cooking evenings and tours for school classes are offered and are reminded of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary is told about his work on the nearby Wachtberg, plants presented as living monuments from the Roman era, and offered a funny lesson in matters of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and attracted Romans.
In the context of a project week, Adendorf's primary school devotes itself to the Roman theme.
With the Roman week, the numerous, but often no longer at first glance visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made available again.
A small presentation will remember the discovery of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic burdens West Africa’s economy
Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a heavy strike for the economy.
Markets are abandoned - and international companies are on a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is causing the West Africa economy a heavy blow.
The harvest is rotting on the fields that are left mines and the markets are missing - the virus has severely increased the region.
Some international companies are also on a distance.
"Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic crisis," judges the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the worst affected
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, selling clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
The market only comes who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is most hit by the virus, and here alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities explained that the disease had occurred in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
Overall, more than 1500 people died, and thousands of others were in existence.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
In all the resource-rich countries, companies are exercising their business.
Foreign companies, such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal, withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer flying the regions concerned.
The local distributors and farmers also respond: Only a few merchants leave their homes to get retirement.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the main cocoa and coffee beans in the fields were destroyed for export.
The farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Foods are getting short
"The people will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris Expert for Western Africa's economy.
The man, for example, who normally goes to the market and sells its vegetables, would prefer to stay at home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and pressingly: food becomes scarce.
On the markets, the stock of basic foods, such as rice, disappears.
At the same time, the strongly dependent region of international companies threatens to damage image - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies usually avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
Decisively, how far and how long the virus will spread.
For investors, the impression could arise, "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also stresses the disturbed state budgets of the States
The disease also burdens the State budgets of the countries concerned.
The Moody's rating agency fears that their budgets are severely maintained by the high expenditure on the health system and also by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (45 million).
In Nigeria, the impacts are well known, where only few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of an infection.
Bookings in hotels also go significantly back.
Protecting her 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates his 50-year-old founding festival from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours at the Schützenverein Tannenwald the preparations for the 50-year-old founding festival from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday, 12 September, a great evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, the big böller shooting is at 6:00 p.m.
Then, in the large festival, the mood evening is with the "Stoapfalzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle cares for the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festival service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the great festival at 14 a.m.
The afternoon is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gauschen.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 Festdamen with their Dirndln.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker have taken over.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" came from 1907, when the association was founded on March 21, "Social Entertainment by Exercise in Room Suits and Small Caliber Shooting".
In 1937, the NS regime had led to the resolution of the club.
Only in 1964, 19 young men found themselves again, who lifted the "new" "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism on April 30 at the guesthouse of Luke.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter through a difficult starting time, in which it was mainly about finding a club location and installing the shooting operation.
Already in autumn 1965, the Schützenverein started in the guesthouse "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sportsmen, who were now organized in seven teams, established in all classes up to 1. Gauliga.
The club records purified annually and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active protectors has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the association site "Leininger" no longer complied with the requirements of a modern shooting club, the then board under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future Domizil in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours on 8 May 1988, priest Strasser gave the church blessing for the new shelters.
One of the major highlights in the club history was certainly the 44th Gauss shooting, linked to the feasible wading of the new shooter in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated his 30-year-old founding anniversary.
A Böller Group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl was Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of honorary work, the association members have modernised the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngau Hof last year and thus brought them to the latest state of technology.
Elf teams in round competitions
You can also see the sports services of the Schützenverein.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air-weight teams, a air-pistol team, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann was rising in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the districtliga 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml rose from Gauliga North to Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as bock sticks, facing and kingballs, club trips and Christmas celebration have tradition.
With this, the shooters are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart ran against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre was placed in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart went his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said that his 14-group team was disappointed, but now focus on the race on the next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can make it better there.
Stewart was already driving on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I came into a good result today with quite good hopes," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the Schlepper and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met another driver at a ash race in the north of the state of New York and killed.
He decided to return this week and to win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., which took place during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities informed that the investigations for the cause of the accident would last at least two weeks.
No decision has been taken about whether Stewart has to expect an accusation.
The three-time champion was received with a great applause when he was presented before the race.
After the start of the 12th position, Stewart had already entered the first 10 and was temporarily on place four.
After a reboot in round 122, Buschs
Cars with no 18 out of control after exit from curve 2 and collided with stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to place 21.
Dance-friended offspring searched for
Simply try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to competitors.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in the TV can also create the whole day lessons at the continuing schools.
After summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now more young people are looking for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two Jazz and Modern Dance Groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly dancer in the Jazz and Modern Dance Formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Third in the group of eight-to-twelf-year-olds, six in the group of twelve-to-15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active ones, it would be much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreography," she says.
Those who enjoy dancing can snuff into the training hours between 17 and 18 hours in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, free of charge.
"The training starts regularly with an upheating program," says the trainer.
Several choreographies are then occupied.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open for many styles.
Elements from folklore through classical to sport and acrobatics are processed in the Jazz Dance.
Of course, sociality is not too short.
"We're going to eat, watch dance films, and we've been watching in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can close friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
Who is not that jazz dance, he can snuff into one of the other offers of the TV jan.
Children and adolescents can always snuff into the classroom in children's dance/Jazztanz, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you like Discofox, Slow Walzer, Vienna Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can watch and join.
Bulgarian Prison Supervisor protests across the country
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have organized a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
More salaries are also on a list of claims to be discussed with the Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for one month and demanding a return to the previous 24-hour barriers.

Ukrainian army has given up Luhansk Airport
In the east of Ukraine, the prorussian fighters continue on the march.
After heavy battles, which were supposedly also involved in Russian pancerbataillone, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, gave up the airport of the Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army informed that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously moved personal consequences from the severe defeat of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army, without mentioning details.
Prorussian Separatists shot a plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussian separatists once again shot a fighter and two military hub screws.
Some 100 soldiers had also been injured or killed in battles in the Donezk region, according to the Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard ships lowered
The rebells also claimed that the first time in the Asovese Sea two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard Station had been lowered.
The Ukrainian border protection confirmed that two of his ships had been shot near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
A spokesman in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The Separatists also reported that several localities in the Donezk area had been controlled.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk today the Ukraine contact group meets.
In addition to the representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an Ambassador of the Separatists from East Ukraine should participate.
In advance, all stakeholders used their performances to make public notice of their request.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia through the planned stationings in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is following the 1997 NATO-Russia Council's founding agreement.
The NATO Chief, however, accused Russia of "a cracking break" of the agreement.
"Today, we need to see the reality that Russia does not view NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
From documents and statements from Russian side, "that they view us as opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that they want to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be concluded at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as it is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiew and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed to renewed discussions on the settlement of their gas dispute.
The negotiations were made for the coming Saturday, said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision of the European Union to send a representative to the discussions.
Because of the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine no longer receives fuel from Russia for weeks.
Recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had contributed between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe covers about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: Maut will come "ganz clear"
Now, the Chancellor is clarified again.
A free letter for all complicated details, but it's not.
Hard-necked concerns from the CDU against the car-mouse have alert the CSU.
After persistent resistance from her CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke a word of power for the introduction of a car wall.
"To make it clear: it is in the Coalition Treaty, and it will come," said the party chief on Monday after meetings of the CDU-Spitzengremies in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not first determine a detailed model.
The black-red government program was called "determined parameters".
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and it is now being further worked on."
However, the NRW CDU keeps on their no tower on all streets.
Merkel emphasized that also Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is introducing itself constructively into the consultations for a draft law.
In addition, he talked to Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special." Schäuble had left an "spiegel" report uncommentated on Sunday, his house examines his own concept to compensate for motorway investors with toll revenue - after election 2017.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer warned of developing Maut concepts against the Federative Minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never assumed to emphasize all circle and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU president.
In that way, it is an important signal that Seehofer has announced to talk about the subject again.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDU country associations Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
The background is the fear that a toll affects small border transport to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition maturity because of the tower criticism of series of CDU.
The Left considers the plans in the light of the dispute in the Union as failed.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said party chief Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Montag).
"With the toll, the Minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce an obligation on all German roads to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be charged additionally according to the coalition contract.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll over the car tax.
However, the model may not disadvantage foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British says she thought as a result of a lack of diagnosis for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the backmark.
Charity CMT UK informed that failure diagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in Great Britain are likely suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weaknesses, an insecure passage and crushed toes.
Distressed also suffers from fatigue or pain. The disease is unhealthy and progressive, which means that the symptoms are getting worse in time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she suffered from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children today, 51 years old, said, "As a child, I knew that I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell constantly and everything took longer with me.
I was never able to ride with the other kids Rollschuh or Skateboard and was often choked in school because of my way of walking.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 after several surgeries to discharge her legs and stretch her feet, she saw her sickness records when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got an answer, I was shocked and paniced.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and then slowly all my abilities would lose.
I made it all alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said, when she became 17, she became aware that her abilities had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up, and embraced me, and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, or you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you have a much less life threatening thing.
After some genetic tests, it was found at its CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to make attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working since the closure of the former troop exercise site as a fireworker
For almost ten years, there has been no shooting at the former troop exercise site in Munich.
Even so, killing ammunition still occurs every month in the heart of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb.
The granates are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be sprinkled locally.
An orene-beating knall halls the explosions over the heartpiece of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell at the Münsingen Truppenübungsplatz, which was closed after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005.
Since this time, the 6500 hectare area has been the core part of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb, which is opened on 13 routes for hikers and cyclists.
Taxation of businessmen in Washington with economic recovery
Recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for companies in the country have increased slightly last year, while economic recovery has accelerated, a newly published study last week, and the companies in Washington were no exception.
Companies in the area District, Maryland and Virginia together paid $27.6 billion to government and local offices in the financial year 2013, an increase by 3.8 percent compared to the revenues of 2012 to $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden of the companies increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased stronger than local taxes, 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by Ernst & Young Service Agency with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from company taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenues come from companies.
Virginia earns the lowest tax revenue from companies by 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is founded in a recovery of the real estate values of the companies, the researchers say, which led to an increase of real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these gains came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the expiry seems to be true for Washington's area.
Company in the district, Maryland and Virginia together paid over $10 billion to government and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion 2012 - an increase by 4.2 percent over a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not so effective in Maryland in increasing government and local tax revenues, as the real estate taxes are about more than one fifth of the tax decisions of companies here.
Businesses in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland the following is happening: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to offer the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenue by companies cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone.
It also seems that business revenues are recovered, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes in government organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in company income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, local taxation for companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The growth rate in the district corresponded to 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a lower average tax income of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the strongest lowest company income taxes with 6 percent in all three offices (in all three firms there are fixed tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study of the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower government and local corporate taxes are required and there is a better tax climate in general than in Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure through its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its company tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the State's income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in Washington seem to go better and therefore pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businesses - a transitional structure after which most small companies are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster growth rate than the overall company taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in company taxes throughout the country will probably continue this year, with an increase in general multi-protection tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, if the Federal Government's expenditure reduction has an impact on the labour market in the region, Washington could go behind.
Partner town: German beer for Guangzhou
Hope and Malz - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner town in China now wishes a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brown in Frankfurt’s partner town Guangzhou - this is the urgency of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would stay in our city," said the Vice-Participate Secretary of the South China Metropole, Li Yiwei, this week visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
During the discussion, the functionary of the governing Communist Party of China returned again and again to this concern of the Twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, was Li.
Therefore, people also possess the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD president Thorsten Schäfer-Gumbel, who led the German political delegation, admitted to the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, cereals and enjoyment," he added at lunch with the party supervisor in Guangzhou.
This enjoyment of life already radiates Mr. Li, he smiled the host.
As a result, the functionary from Guangzhou arrived with beaver gimble - but with red wine served for the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewery.
Tsingtao-Bier is used after the German purity command.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Parteichef Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but in 2012, for economic reasons, deleted.
"It would pay itself again," the municipal politician was convinced.
"Managing between our two cities is increasing".
At this time, travellers would have to take the route over Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight.
The Vice Governor of the Province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," said Schäfer-Gumbel - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nicked.
Supported Partnership
Guangzhou's liar Vice-Chairman hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already at Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came to office this year after his predecessor had been carried out from the office on account of the claims of corruption.
The local party chief Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the functionaries from Guangzhou is part of a national campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is carried out with hardness by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
He worked as a top functionary in Fujian, where the VW car builds a large work before joining his office in Guangzhou.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers away Guangzhou is one of the two sides, such as with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year-old existence of the German-Chinese link was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis on the pearl flow is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic power.
The next year she wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "press the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been conscious three days ago since her delivery to a hospital in New York City; however, her daughter has shown hopelessly today that the 81-year-old comician recovers from her illness.
"Thank you for your persistent love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We're all pushing the thumbs.
Her mother was sent to the Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for heartbeat in a clinic at Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors will deliberately keep them sedated and under precise observation until they are more satisfied with their state, which is still described as "earst".
The reactions came from many pages, also in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaner and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners, which come into trade from now on, stricter environmental standards will be applied in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners receive from 1 September to a label where the buyer can detect central data on a glance like the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, more nitrogen oxide values are applied in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the disarmament builders: they receive a united minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys twitch for $1,04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twich for $1,04 billion (970 million US-$).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one had expected a acquisition of twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion decision, and the cooperation also appeared naturally.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", such as an insider.
The Twich interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better exchanges give the (mostly older) games a suit of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just like that YouTube is often called when you want to describe twitch, so the message that YouTube twitch wanted to buy was taken up something, a bookbook example of a established technology company that buys a potential competitors.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not achieved, as the company reported was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about this at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twich.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to drive sports rather than watch them, it is difficult to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others when playing instead of taking the control console into hand.
It's one thing to watch a friend over the shoulder at 3 o'clock in the morning while she slept by Resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a spider as he's shot in Call of Duty 20 times after each other.
All these games can be seen right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so viewing without own control of the vision can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast cycles in which the Roger Bannisters have completed all games of our electronic age in record time are entertaining.
But as long as not a game or humor virus is involved, his twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know like I already know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It is hard to imagine that twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video, as YouTube Twich could have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who will be converted as a advertisement.
As the Chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of Gaming," and the medium shows no signs of a shrinking, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
At the Hüpfburg at the Burggarten festival, there was a lot on Sunday evening.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the strong rainboat on Saturday evening, it is estimated that 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
In time, the entry had to be stopped.
"That was angry," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was already shown on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors came to open air.
A feast for all generations had promised the organizers.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese it had made salt-wedelers, but also guests from the near and further surroundings comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, wipped with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cool beverages - short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were expected.
And that cross through the generations.
While one on ceilings on the extra-carred white sand leaped on the beach bar, others were able to reach a quarter of wine in Vinothek, the younger grew up at the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the child's smile, the voluntary helpers in the truest sense of the word had to do all the hands to become the Andrang Lord and to magnify fantasieous creations in the small faces.
The sizers used the crickets or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew founded from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 punched he down to the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attraction of the festival did not abort.
"There came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of "a success on the whole line."
That is why a recurrent of the big party is not against the next year.
Although it is still necessary to work on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear in a first balance on Sunday against the people's voice.
As annoying, he said that in the meantime the entry had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little forces.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the ground anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimation, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who drumped in the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox broke off its appearance.
The technicians were unable to create half-way reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt weeds because of a tyre pan.
"But next year they will be there," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was more than successful by the visitors.
And that's bad weather.
However, the organizers have committed some mistakes that will be left for the first time but must be eliminated at the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organisers need criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately you've taken a little," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I think it's very good that some not only stupid quats, but also really try to put something on their legs.
Take care!", Stephanie Jenß writes to Amula.
Now the organizers remain a year to cancel these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Waitberg's Wahrzeichen shrinks
It's not expected to be the same.
Instead, the willing part is waiting to be used in the marked building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the construction of the space monitoring radar TIRA, the cover, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47,5 meters than the old.
But the size remains world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old cover is separated and removed with a crane.
Afterwards the last quarter of the new cover is set up.
As far as the weather is involved, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participants at the ice bucket challenge dominates pine
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain cried so much when her ice cold water was poured over her head that she wounded the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket chalk went painfully right there.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had shouted so much at the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she drove out the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain circled so much when her ice cold water was poured over her head that she injured her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaw remained just standing," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is shot over the 20-year-olds.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that wasn't going, the jaw was crochet, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this, and they almost did laugh in the pants, but I had to get in the emergency.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was sent to the hospital in order to relapse the jaw after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The Clip was linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Can the Burgvereins get back to a stroll soon?
Last time, between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen, there was always a twist.
Now the boards think about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former president of Wolfratshauser Burgfriende, launched the project in the French Guédelon.
Another year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfriend Wolfratshausen.
The positions of the Wolfratshauser Castle and the possible reconstruction seemed to be very different.
Now the two camps are moving together: soon talks are to be conducted about a common approach.
This confirms the club boards Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could put together once," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of the two associations could be able to move back to a strain in the future.
This is how faster visible success can be achieved.
While the castle friends around the sudden deceased Richard Dimbat had seen a rebuilding of the castle at the mountain forest, the "extension and experience" of the site is at the foremost place for the castle club around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second Chairman of the Burgfriend, has been very pleased according to his own information about the call.
Since Dambat's death, he has been present to the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently counts around 40 members.
"After my friend Richard Dimbat died, we have first let the association activities rest out of respect." This "Denk phase" was needed to "consider how it could continue."
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go to the conversation with the castle club.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current mood image within their grouping.
There is currently no presidency candidate, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself." He doesn't want to defend himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The tölzer wants to continue to work with the project "but very much".
The different positions on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the next time.
He honors Dimbeth as a "Missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
By a high involvement of the population and by voluntary helpers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "Even I was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to drive the project forward. It could be created a "all-configuration feature" for the Flößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"The idea of reconstruction I personally don't want to just throw on board." He hopes that the castle association might move something on this point.
Their goal to document the history first is "important and good".
After that, you could continue to see.
Clever ways to save in Uni-learnbooks
Since the costs for university books for many students were more than $1,000 per year, the fast-two-two-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever Sparidee.
He found a lending system for books of higher semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-keks," said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college director informed that the students spend more than $1,200 per year for teaching books and study material, but that there were different cost-damping options for the students.
Online loads and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution to the choice for the students.
Renting books becomes more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookshops, informed that the rental of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookshops were rented last spring semester, Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased in Campus Bookshops, according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one time for the best deal.
Buy Online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are in the campus book shop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased for $239.99 in the specialized book retailer Chegg.com.
Buy Used
If you do not make any of the notes of other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business".
The book was newly sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether earlier expenses were allowed.
Sometimes updates are not relevant for seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of costs for the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rental
Renting books is worth considering if you treat them somewhat well, remember giving them back and you do not want to keep the books after the course is completed.
You can save more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Tell yourself about the provisions of the business where you rent, including the penalty fees that may apply for writing notes, underlinings or signs of use.
Tenants watched: If you do not return the book, the penalties may even exceed the price of a new book.
Emails
E-books instead of conventional teaching books are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering teaching books can be very expensive.
Look around anyway.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the pricing of books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order you should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually premature.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the college book shop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" wasn't a cashschlager
"The Expendables 3 from Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" just played $12 million of its budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" tailored to Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million at the opening week, while children's films like "Drachenzähmen leicht gemacht 2" also disappointed the revenues.
An article of the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that in the children's films of the lack of quality in the movies itself, the reason could be.
Collin described in 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "Drachenzähmen leicht gemacht 2" as purely "functional" fantasy progress.
In movies for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and in the current year to at least 2000 line walls.
The results are based on the views of the cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's filmhit is equivalent to those of the previous year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Regisseur Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's junglebook film, said to Hollywood Reporter's website: "I think the times change."
We need to accept this and not try to follow the past.
Contrary to the current weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently achieved sales with streaming amounts of 1.3 billion dollars, almost twice as much as the previous year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they concentrated too much on comics films and prophesied a "cern melt" Hollywoods.
In the light of the current deviation, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could well contain a real core.
However, due to the potential cash strikers to be expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of the cash results as a simple "cyclical" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the largest summer at the cinema at all, and no one will worry about the business."
When a few years ago the second table tennis district class was deleted for punishment of the ligen division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd federalliga into the program.
The result: Whoever has not ascended has descended.
Thus, Göttingen's class highest team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the exit, but in the coming season only fiveth-class plays.
Fourth-class Torpedos Ladies, despite their grandiose passing into the Regional Liga.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxonyliga, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo reservations are taking place in the new Association League, and there are no more Göttinger Clubs in the Landesliga.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the band'sliga, the Torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class is now the new District Soberliga South.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Oberder SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC arrive.
As regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the Upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III, the District Summerliga of Women begins at least in Sollstärke.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are starting in the districtsliga.
With nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small districtliga.
The Districtliga Foundation of the SCW-Jungen - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen circle lines start with nine teams.
In the West Staffel are the Red White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the eastern stifle, among others, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
The Ladies-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in Osterode, where there are no women's teams at the circle level.
It is noteworthy that none of the six 2nd classes are reaching Sollstärke, here the innovative and radical board will have to think about once.
Nato summit: First protest in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests from opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff before the town hall there to hold a so-called counterpart.
Stephen Fairclough has persecuted the developments of the weekend and spoke to demonstrators traveling from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWEE young bush walls were secured with the winds of the rope after they were captured the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govets Leap in Blackheath to their tour.
Cared relatives called the police at about 20 a.m. when they had not returned home.
A group of local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found waterfalls near Bridal Veil at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had hurt himself on the knees and the man was crashed and had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed at the couple overnight, and they were flew out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable state with a ambulance.
Escalate government enemy protests in Pakistan
The roughly 1,000 demonstrators were driven by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
The broadcaster resumed the radio after a half hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial operation.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators call for the resignation of the head of the government to which they defeat elections.
The police informed that about a mile from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, it had come back to collisions of about 3,000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital details, a policeman was injured.
During the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to push to Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the Army's headquarters, the mighty military had called for a political solution of the conflict "to waste without time and to apply without violence".
The Communication also said: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state."
The escalating violence has caused concern for the intervention of the military, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have lasted since the day of independence on August 14.
Sharif refuses to withdraw.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to withdraw," said Khan.
Qadri said similarly.
Khan suggests Sharif to win the parliamentary election last May by fraud.
Qadri calls for the withdrawal of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is supposed to reform the election system and to call out new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
At first, the demonstrators had paused peacefully before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to enter Sharif's residence.
Hütteldorfer after second season victory on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig for Rapid, a bitter week ended on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who pushed three with green white on place.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season victory and goes with a success experience to the country game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Foreign Defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership volley, won the victory of the sixteenth triangle in the 14th minute.
"I thought I was gonna go in all the frustration from Thursday and snatched him under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had hit a federal party for the last time on 13 November 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship strike in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in a special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid growing," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term basin blessure of Mario Pavelic, scratched from the left to the right defensive side and made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this position mirroring.
The gate he deserved, he has already done some Assistians," praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally made the decision.
Because before, the guests could also have been able to write.
"Thanks to God we have had a little luck today," said Schravmmel, who thus played on the outbreak of performance and results in the past weeks: "The results have not voted, but the player was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games you had been better than today" – against "the strongest team that played in this stadium in this season".
The first three-pointer since July 26, therefore, has proved that the team's structure was intact with the retrospectives: "Today, my team has shown that she has character."
Not less pleased for him: "That we finally played too zero again".
A lot of work during country playpause The fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several outsourcings are to be complained, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start elevator, make the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," said Barisic, who lost with Behrendt and Pavelic players over the last three days, "they were very stable in recent times".
Therefore, the country game break has to be used to "lick wounds and to make a little in the physical area," Barisic said, who has five U21 selection actors in his series.
One of the breaks is probably especially located, Captain Hofmann.
He's breaking up for the team. He's going over pain.
Just in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic observed.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his excursion in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also achieved the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match from the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 about the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe it's all right now" "We've probably also had a little luck, but at some point luck must come back to us.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He said, "You must not always see it black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the past weeks as it was presented.
But we must not believe that everything is all right now.
He could not contend with the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help at the moment.
They're keeping on me in some stages," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to show himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counterpart "from the category of magicians", as well as the regular gateway of Nutz in the 40th minute, which was unjustly known by arbitrary colleague.
The only accusation I can make of the team is that we weren't exactly enough towards gate in some phases.
We had too little conclusions.
Interior defendant Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It just started badly, but then we found pure and even made a gate.
Overall, it would have been more in it.

We showed a powerful tribe at our riddle task of the summer series "My piece of Rhine's Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these tree varieties are still in the district, the portrayed is the "heat" above under-white brown.
A hollow path leads up to the about 600-year-old oak.
It passes across groups, basalt stones and basalt stone lakes.
A piece below the stone break from Bauerberg, one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, there it is.
Vital looks like the natural memorial, it stretches beyond the other trees of the surroundings and reminds of an American mammock tree with a range of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree steam indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only references to the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bishopsheim archive and asked older people from underwitten brunn to find out what concern it has with the scourge.
The result of his research remained the fairly nutritious declaration for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat shirts are supposed to have driven their animals from under-white brown into the timber-red meadows and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the exhausted animal guards of the ascension should have rested.
Meanwhile, the area has gained its significance back, because on the meadows actually wept goats again.
The area has also been explained to the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
When you enter the stone collections, however, you should be cautious, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for crossrotters.
A hiking path leads from under-white brunn to the tree, but something hidden.
Further paths are described, the direction of high thorns rise up and invite to an extended hiking.
Where's the Waterburg?
However, a waterburg that is searched for at our next task is rather rare at the height.
The mirroring in the grave already gives a good impression of the construction, but we have some historical buildings in the district to which the building conterfei could fit.
Where is our "step of Rhine's luck"?

After watching Tauziehen, Italy's Prime Minister and ambitious EU President, Matteo Renzi, has carried out the nomination of its Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy last week against strong conservative oppositions at the EU special summit, she will follow the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government newspaper La Repubblica represents the call for Mogherini as a favourite in the government team as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects a drive for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the constant left-handed party base, because Mogherini is assigned to it, though more moderately.
Against the conservative representatives with President Jean-Claude Juncker of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, said the predominant opinion in Rome to make a political compensation.
For the EU's head diploma becomes at the same time Vice-President Juncker.
The outstanding consent of the EU Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would not have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the governing Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spread optimism that for almost two decades, Mogherini's best practice in leading party offices and for their ambitions will show itself the "enormal challenges".
The born Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began the PhD Politologin in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democrats di Sinistra (left Democrats), which joined the Catholic Center Party Margherita to today's social democratic PD in 2008.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
With the 2001 election in the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she joined the High Party Policy, working in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose leader soon became it.
It occupied traditional focuses on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO action in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troop contingent, the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the US Democrats.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Members in which she has been a expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his Foreign Minister.
If the PD has a better relationship to the strong peace movement in the country today, which contributed to the over 40 percent votes of the party to the EU elections in May, then, as is mentioned in PD-Kreisen, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The precautions in Brussels, which the new EU Foreign Officer has too little diplomatic experience, so if it is missing from substance, the PD is being coordinated.
In Brussels, particularly by Poland and the Baltic Members, it is mystrously realistic accent Mogherini's being pursued for the crisis in Ukraine and is diffamed as a "land-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to South Europe, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi entered his term of office as EU chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first visit to State.
Photos that they showed with Putin in the Shake hand were embarrassed in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kreml Chief for October to be a Mailänder Economic Summit.
A total of nine young people began their training at Emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an Azubi, who has already completed another training in the company.

The socialists in France should "keep the mouth and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important allies.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist presidents, whose cabinet conversion has resulted in disapproval with the large majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said at a great applause.
As an appelling gesture, the Prime Minister stated that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite severe demands for a halting of the regulation of Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show himself "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, struck sand into the drive, in which she appeared at a meeting of a deceased socialist representatives and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "belief in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the constant grave fights of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothing, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old did not even survive a summer.
"And the new one will not survive the autumn or winter," said Fräulein Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the reputation of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that she was going to be a winner in preferential elections and was ready to go to the government.
The governing party of France suffered a defeat at the municipal elections in March and the law-oriented national front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of breaking into several rival groups before the end of the term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a politician at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve any improvement in the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise provider, has advanced negotiations for the acquisition of Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises as well as its wealthy customership, while there is competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the conversations could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the Private Equity Society Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, since the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company in Miami operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.

Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China on the day following the election decision.
A peking-faith group swept near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the management election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must at first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with peking-faith members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposing democrats to be approved for choice and caused pro-democratic activists to fulfill their threats and to lame Hong Kong's financial area with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's party leadership fears that the call for democracy extends to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in June China's domination over Hong Kong, democracy activists held an inofficial referendum on the election procedure in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li's survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese connection office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, as well as the Vice-Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted over the course of the day.
Student activists announced to gather in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the headquarters office.
United Kingdom did not provide democratic elements until the end phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands Kiev to take up "state talks" with Eastukraine
The Russian president Wladimir Putin said that on Sunday, Russian media reports demanded that the Ukrainian government launch the fight against the separatists in the eastern part of the country and directly enters negotiations on the "state" of the apostate region.
His spokesperson Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the region of Eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status toward Ukraine had to be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiewer government for negotiations at the height of the eyes with the pro-Russian rebellions, however, is similar to the strategy that he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the excretions five months ago: help for the separatists to take areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government in order to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossija factual independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with the State TV channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the reconquest of the areas held by Separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18th.
The Kreml and the Separatists have recently referred to the area "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term that reminds of the prerevolutionary glossy of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaign, hope to attack Ukrainian politicians for elections on the 26th Oct. and during government groups of civil communities in the areas held by Separatists, are "in their illusions caught" reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to enter into detailed discussions not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state of the southeastukraine to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the state in the context of the greater autonomy that has been debated by the Kiev leadership for months to scatter fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kreml speaker to correct the "Fehlin interpretation" of Putin highlighted the leadership claim of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, contrary to the direct annex of the Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty contacting the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in East Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict showed a broad majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy, addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums, would give the regional governments in Ukraine full power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kreml de facto control over a territory that connects the Russian state territory to Crimea.
The Peninsula in the Black Sea, which has been annexed five months ago, is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and castries that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislation, after re-election, should take into account the Constitution, with which the respective areas are given greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arms and rebellion are cast against Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at the height of the eyes followed by a further invasion of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks have entered eastern Ukraine across the previously peaceful region along the Asovian sea.
The Separatists supported by Russia, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officers, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, is the control of Nowoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been made to establish Mariupol, a steel industrial harbour with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Nowoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimea Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leadership in Brussels and urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We're shortly ahead of a point where there's no return anymore," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide concrete actions, the leadership required the draft further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in an unspecific escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank colons and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donezk region last week to support the armed separatists, said Prince Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, included by the Russian accident in Ilowajsk, were exchanged against 10 Russian parachute hunters who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago on Sunday.
Nacktfotoscandal around Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey noblest made a hole about his anger about hackers who probably have stolen naked images of his engaged Gabi Grecko and a who is who stole the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking candal around Promis on the Internet.
The hacker responsible for it probably has 60 nackt photos of Lawrence, star from "the tribute of Panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
From Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, there were also private photos due to an iCloud hole.
The list contains 101 Promis.
The noblest who had engaged with Grecko last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reported that a news website said that the hack was "because" and that the affected people felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two photographs in which she is without a pool.
Among the filmworks Palmers are "Love is unconquerable" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ: "It is a horrible violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "To post hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing but the sale of hehlerware."
Just legally seen, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radlers, Joggers and Wanderers were at the 8th cycling at the Grand Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the association "Help for cancer-related children".
The tour, which was for one Torture, was a lightweight training for the others.
In one, however, all agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For for the first time in his life, the chief of the Oberurseler Brauhauses was driven yesterday with the wheel on the Feldberg.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cater, since he also had a valuable knowledge of his participation on the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for cancer children" (Frankfurt).
A great thing.
"I know now I can do this - fine!"
Little paws on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped, it would've been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants were piercing to mountains yesterday in the early tau and came near the exhaustion but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier for others to overcome the long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The whole red green politician from the circular day - red dress, red bike - made a little bit on understatement at the start ("Every lot of professionals, there is arrival the goal!"), but then proved to be half a professional at the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the route in a sleeve, as well as Nina Kuhn, press speaker of the city of Oberursel, who had gone along with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two Triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radles" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "This is about Charity, there we are happy with it - we would have done an exit today," says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) went down to Oberursel in the morning to shample back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swept home in the saddle at 9 a.m., "made" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Fun had also "Fritten-Toni".
For the chief of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, bike tours across the Feldberg are easy.
He had 40 minutes with his 6.5 kilo race wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The through-trained Mainzer says that he is an ambitious racer.
He must be, too, because he was on his way with the "Fixie-Rad", which are also racing bikes, but without switching...
The fact that it also went up without a wheel, proved not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, but also a jogger who went on a cord a author reef with weights behind it.
Bergwacht-Artist Professor Volker Lischke, who, with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, provided security, said, "That I know" from Frankfurt, who trained for a special slittentrail, only that he pulls the slitten itself." So, the man is in some cases his own slitten dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never yet - were sent to groups on the route in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 p.m.
It followed the first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers left.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the "Radeln on the Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished to the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to lock the route up to the Feldberg to the security of the participants.
