What is she supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know a full-depth place, nor the "conditory".
The new capital councillors from the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS at the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once "clocked down" members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as they dominate the notorical snake that has bourgeoised in the past years in which today's coalition partners were on the row in Prague.
The codated vocabulary, which was introduced by the Prague political elite in the flooded era of the Supreme Mayor Pavel Bém, has been abandoned with some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, there was evidence that the new councils were dropping something in the dark in relation to the new terms.
They say that at least.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am rather a new man in Prague's politics," responded Lukáš Kaucký, the new counselor for culture, to the test of the "Paten-Wortschatz".
But also President Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I turn on and off."
"And I don't think much of snake."
From the vocabulary published in the journal Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election conference, the editorial section picked out six terms, especially those notorically associated with the Prague Magistrate Council.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "great Prager Golfloch", "going into the conditory", "tigernacken", "Verrat der Hauptstadt" and "bleach".
Three Prager councillors agreed to the test, the fourth Antonín Weinert, the future chief of Prague school, first promised his participation in the conversation, but then not even took the listener away.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois Democrats talk to each other, I don't judge it."
"For me it is important how we understand ourselves in the framework of our programmes," he competeed.
As already indicated, Lukaš Kaucký in the headline mentioned above was supposedly not recognized that the influential entrepreneur and friend of Bém, Roman Janoušek, were speaking.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all, and the only term that he correctly advised during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, but to safety added: "But I know that rather from the newspaper."
And reluctantly, "I'm gonna have to give a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then decised not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councilman for Environmental Questions Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel of Blanka.
However, both Social Democrats also know for whom the term Voldemort stands and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and thereby also what it means to "go into the conditory".
"I think that this means to go in some Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution, if you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he regrets that he had made these knowledge rather from the newspaper than that he would be owned by this vocabulary.
In fact, there seems to be no similarly bourgeois snake among the Social Democrats to judge the test participants.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, we also use shortcuts or nicknames again," says the chairman of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know whether my colleagues also call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tested the name and see - he works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly for the party members of the "opa" or less friendly of the "old", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who made attention to himself before the elections by acting by the party sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego-Figur).
Nicknames are the only ones that allow social democrats to speak in the inner-party language.
Hulínský does not supposedly like it if it is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague Chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber-Knüppel-Recht" is supposed to have done that Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to undermine the torture of "hexen" and published a brochure
Women who are labelled in Burkina Faso for witches usually show some common social features.
They belong rather to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
If one of these women will "were" to the witch, she will be strictly isolated so that it cannot be dangerous for the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women remain free of this because they help and bear children in the work," describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than one hundred women who have been exterminated by their communities.
The local government now decided to oppose this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason published a brochure that is intended to undermine the "hex tracking".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said the newspaper "derStandard" to the dilemma of written information.
However, witchcraft is also in other African countries in progress and inadequate.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they overgold them with Petroleum and just bleed them.
This incident also reported the server BBC.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter would have been only a meeting of unhappy circumstances.
According to their version, oil was flamed which was used for ritual salmons.
And it is, after the group has tried to "each evil spirit" out of the woman.
The isolation of "hexes" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Friends of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least strives to evacuate the witch hunting, the Gambian president has made a good mix of the President himself last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after his aunt's death, unfolded a monstrous witch hunt, as they supposedly had part in their death and now would try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"Therefore he called Shamane from nearby Guinea to help him, who, together with policemen, soldiers and the president's bodygarde, violently detained women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in their report.
On the farm, the occupied people were forced to drink an absorption of plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of the international pressure, the almost a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant from Bakala: Although heated in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older man who is abandoned just leaves the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a mappe with three new rental contracts to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who just forgot a prison penalty.
All three have just increased the rent in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rents, the son is supposed to be riding for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns next year.
"And there is not even flowing warm water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he tips with his finger on the new rental contract of the son, to whose signature he has a perfection.
"But what - I signed," he explains half a vote and half abandoned.
The Civil Association BytyOKD.cz, which referred to the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, in which it intends to publish an instruction on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man just wins off.
"The one says this, the other," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region becomes the major "deregulation laboratories".
After a new year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid market-friendly rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and breaking nine in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door, the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller are there.
"May 2011", a special key field lights on the touch screen.
Soon tipped and already the device spucks out a number list.
We didn't decipher the number "157" and already pee it on the large display at the ceiling of the waiting room.
A half a second later, you're on the row.
Something later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room seems not to be the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and similar.
From mid-November the Kuverts in the region of Ostrava flourish with the new rental contracts most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests an increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client center has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs something over a week, that is, that's just the beginning," the ladies behind the switch replied after a moment when the "Client" pupps off as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former mining apartments are a brilliant topic.
Before the elections, Parliament Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD had taken this issue quite loud, no wonder today that the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even the WC-Brille could switch them out," the man mentioned in the beginning makes air.
According to the employees, especially pensioners are on the switch to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rental discount that promises RPG when signing the special offer in time.
In the enjoyment of a half-paid February rent, the other tenants should also come to sign the new rental contract until 15 December.
Until now, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded by demands.
"From the yesterday 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of here," the switch officials appreciate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements, both on its websites and wall panels where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, it is determined by an independent court.
"This should not be threatening but is to be understood as information about the only possible and fully legitimate legal approach," RPG explains on its websites.
"There's no one going in court," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center gives you at least partially right.
"I have 13.000 (crown) pensions, of which 5,000 remain for me for dinner, where I should take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee gets insecure.
"See Mal."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so people are still waiting for," she recalls.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to the increase in tenants is an economic necessity.
"The existing size of the rentals is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the RPG Byty's apartment portfolio, and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund, criticised by the tenants incurred, is, according to the household owners, the main reason for the increase in tenants.
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 was able to invest four billion from the rented rentals in the apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is supposed to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the polder seals in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red-lighting information occurs again and again.
"The tenants increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"This means not more than 7.50 CZK per square metre and month", read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, the increase is extremely low rental prices of 19,66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments the rent will remain at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation does not lead the rent to the high level, but takes place gradually within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposes another obligation: all revenues from the tenant increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the heat inhalation.
But - first of all, these are to benefit those who sign the agreements on tenants' increase.
The architects saw a - the office also belongs to a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the Arch.Design company.
But who would expect a mini-childgarten here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playing place on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the staff of Arch.Design last year.
The projecting and architectural office Arch.Design, from which ateliers are a number of famous Brunner Bauten, counted from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the rooms for his business mini-children garden.
In a wiser perspective, for most of its 90 employees (inside) are in the baby tree age and the company is located to return to their workplace as soon as possible by project antists and architects.
Together with the possibility of shortening work, the kindergarten is another bonus to offer Arch.Design to its employees in the concept of their social program.
The construction engineers have made it easier to put their demanding occupation and child care under a cave.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design's employees and with the support of management, they have been able to gain funding from the European Union and from the Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operation Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic State budget.
Thanks to this financing (advantages of 2,8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment were provided and for the period of 2 years is provided for qualified staff and business.
After the exhaustion of the funding (2 years) the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate mini-childgarten 3 more years at its own cost.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, while the Economy Rating company provided active assistance in the processing of applications.
The children care for fully qualified personnel - a nurse and a pediatric teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age limitations, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-childrengarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day over several children switches each other.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly compatible with the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although this is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-childrengarten is still comparable to the framework programme of pre-training.
The children play not only here, but above all they are given excellent lessons - from basic insights to pre-education, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive business environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress falls when they get the children out of a far away kindergarten.
The parents therefore use their working time more productive.
No wonder there are natural and loyal employer relationships.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies that offer clear benefits in the application of new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof moulds like the back of a prehistoric ecse, the staircases like the spine of a dinosaurian and the balconies are excited fish maizes.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic shapes got the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles splitters and mosaics, the facades remembering of shoes and all current lines, all these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living.
It is noted that when you see more precisely, all is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night, the whole façade is even more plastic, dramatic and special lighting enhances the shine of the colors.
The same vibrant lines and swallowed shapes also dominate the inside of the house.
Well-like shaped wood copied the window frames, lands, decorative elements of doors, even gambling holes and performances.
The Batlló house in the Eixample district of Passeig de Grácia no. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese executed.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the prosperous industrial Josep Batlló, originally stood on the abbreviation of the old and construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea Gaudís for an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
The Casa Batlló rental house, however, did not escape Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
On its zipping board, the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics at the façade were his idea.
However, many other artists and artists were also involved in the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in the Güell Park, where there are also other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nicknames "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "good house".
It is also said that on the top of the building the sword of Saint Georg, the patron of Catalonia, is represented.
But also other sculpture elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the time.
Something bizars already encourage their 45-degree renewal.
In his work, Gaudí ignored all the construction regulations at that time and could not be confused by them.
However, before the beginning of the construction, he took the corresponding construction permit from the city, but the information made by him about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so disturbed in the completion of the project two years later that they demanded remediation.
Among other things, the Councillors came to the fact that the construction with its pillars even entered the public side.
However, there was no further changes, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the call for the city district, Josep Batlló asked for the authorization of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and she was promptly granted to him.
The house owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the third floor the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment were located.
The ground floor was deported to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building passes a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Through the fundamental elements of the conversion, all the right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and floated walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be fully linked by opening the salon doors, so a larger society could easily plauder without a certain intimacy in the case of more confidential discussions.
The house was also received a rather unusual roof and two more floors by Gaudí's conversion except a new façade.
Gaudí's game is also impressive with light as well as the blue and white glassed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the light courts.
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply made the principle of nutze that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the World Heritage List of Unesco in 2005, can visit everyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and most beautiful apartment is made available to the public.
The house owners decided only in the year to this step and this from the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the famous Creator.
When one found that this is a fairly tangible business, the visits were kept, and they were also extended to further common and the roof floors, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building monument is not a pappenstiel, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist exhibitions get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rose? Women have different wishes than men
Not the most great bed frame, but the quality of the bed area - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these need to be harmoniously complemented in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Similarly, the interior in which mattress and roses have to be subordinated is also important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house that is not heated regularly, latex matratresses are not well suited because they need a lot longer to become "warm".
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And they should be used regularly.
For if they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and still lie on a solid plate, moisture arises: so it is not excluded that they form under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used.
Those who have been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses are common with soft layers, will be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Well all ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"They just need a soft layer of Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam - a shape-saked polymer) for their chickens, heels and hips."
"I recommend these, among other things, sugar diseased people who are suffering from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in pollen-term furniture.
That's why I've been getting many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers have given these mattresses with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses include the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco scheme.
This "wonder" actually works very simple.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it actually swims on the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, in the night you don't want to go around like after a heavy fight.
You're just sleeping a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wund fire).
When choosing the mattress size, the length of the soles should still be calculated, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, who is large at the 180 cm, needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleeves should be available at least 90 cm, so together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
The comfort half and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are on your back, you should still be enough space for the lightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the enthusiasm of the Polsters and Space Equipmenters, who has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and also presents this topic on special schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs a own roast and its own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else remains than assembling the rosts at different heights and that is not possible at any bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be taken off on the form layer and the fine brush.
"With the hand or when the feathers are put, you can't feel the feathers," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special roast type.
Whole-polished beds with mattress and underlage as well as co-adult Siamzwillings have nothing to search in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the reference cannot be washed, which is already in progress today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat in one night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress becomes slowly a huge (and stuck) seven.
This is why professionals reject advertising logans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong warranty in mattresses.
Every thing has her when and But.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shy the hygiene of the washable, detractable covers, yet it is advisable to use a mattress shoe that you can easily detract and wash.
Even though today mattress covers are usually produced with round zipper, so that after opening you get two halfs (especially important for washing and washing machine size!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially executed alone, often as the inequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in the bed instead of a roste?
Get out of it!
Or highest for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
They should also prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if they are not already in it) and mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with such pocket springs and fine pounds.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (or combinations of latex and coconuts) are suitable for non-adjustable latten rosts with a larger number of latten, i.e. 28 and more pencils, with Lordosen support in the lingering spin and the possibility to regulate the latten hardness.
There are no mattresses with feather skeleton on adjustable lamb rust, as they do not respond to the ergonomic position.
In addition to the setting of the filament bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This concerns a special fastening of the feather bars that enables or even turn the feather bars to allow the punctual insink of the shoulder of the sleeve.
In particular, for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area for herren mattresses.
It is also thought to the ladies - to them these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-lastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or roasts are determined with point-lastic contact paths with so-called multitorsion springing.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (to large and full) head cushions to the right mattress and right roast, most benefits will be lost again.
Here too a rule: the head cushion should support its head, its tips should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm kiss appears, for example, as it likes the Scandinavier.
In the side position, the head cushion (in combination with the school retirement zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have meant with the once-filled (high-filled) straw sacks.
Modern manufacturers use increasingly more and more natural materials or at least their implications.
The new magic word "Bio" is also known for mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, it is used to produce polyurethane foams more and more common natural oils, such as ricinus and soya oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is known for mattresses, which consists of purely natural materials", explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
But natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress coverages - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance during sleep.
Here, too, one makes a difference between man and woman.
While a "cooling" plant extract is used in men from birch leaves so that the mattress ratio can absorb the heat and cool the body, the ratios for women have "heating" effect.
Extractions made of red pepper shots regenerate the blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Matrats made of cold foam (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercially common polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffs (heards) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-son mattresses that know exactly where head, hips and heels are.
However, for a high-quality mattress you have 7000 crowns and more to rap.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT as they are considered medical aid.
The first Czech company, Gumotex, was granted this advantage.
You can see saving at the mattress and roast isn't that easy.
There are occasionally special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with a visco-shaum memory related to 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the beginning.
Tempur becomes soft at warmth, in cool environment it is re-enabled.
Thus it fits the human body perfectly and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in other health products, such as in special pedestrians to facilitate the legs and vessels.
Indigenous manufacturers, for example, use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to have the kids under control
The fear of their own children grows, so more and more parents are considering to monitor them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for cars, can order as well people, which would be helpful in such cases as recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappears.
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette box but soon it should not be bigger than a bracelet clock.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and fear, so they look for ways and means to protect their children better.
Also for the price of affecting their privacy.
"We strive to say to all that it is not a matter of herum pioneers, but of an effective means of reducing the probability of tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in the individual case there can be a misuse of such devices, for example, when someone is in the pocket without knowing about it, but we haven't had any such case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "sheep" serves and how to use it in the emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková, however, points out that if a child does not wear such a thing, it simply dissolves his child.
"Even very little children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they do not want to be controlled."
"Because the mobile phones first raised great expectations with the parents, but they can turn off as easy as these new surveillance devices," Ms. Bočková said.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappers, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be sorted."
"Today it's the cell phone."
"If such surveillance devices find broader use, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would be safely accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always a step ahead," says the psychologist.
It admits, however, that similar devices can be very helpful in sudden attacks by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the RC Monitoring Society, the location services offer both for cars and for people, can help the existence of such a device even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted so that it will report the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it was immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"With more expensive devices, even an inclination knife is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning with reference to the position," says Mr Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to play a special software.
The problem of the current positioning devices is that it concerns either devices in string wooden box size, the trailers are similar or smaller mobile phones.
It's always the risk of losing it.
Mr. Pilin from the Macro Because, therefore, it is tested in the present equipment that looks like normal digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognise that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Of he notices that after some time, what the police give a time prevail," he adds.
No matter in what direction the development is going - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is used as in the vehicle location.
So the combination of positioning function with the GPS system (generally like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignorances that you could turn around all of the Czech Republic but you could keep just two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometres of ignorance, and has been fired with explosion sets.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometres of Zündschnur to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the forces have taken care of 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignorance - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignorance of STV Group's share company, a.s. for lapse 40 million crowns.
In his reasoning for purchasing this huge amount of Zündschnur, the Generalstab MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of Zündschnur annually.
According to the research by army pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES responded to it, this statement shows that the entire army would have to complete an extremely intense pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and guardians.
Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only so could the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometers of ignition be halfways justified.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But the same would be the same for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies to the training of every new professional soldier two meters of ignorance, the army has created a calming stock for the 225 years mentioned, even under the rising needs of the pioneer and special units.
In this context, soldiers of the rapid use brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for hand-fire weapons, so that shooting exercises of the missing funds are severely restricted.
To be silent from the shortage of underpants.
"I'm not going into why they buy such a lot of ignorance from us."
But this is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer we want to meet as a dealer most widely," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of Zündschnur, that the army would have covered with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year period of use of the ignorance and police and army pyrotechnicians only of two years.
"In the case of perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, but who wants to remain unnamed to not be accused of criticism in the army.
After the expiry of the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument from the Ministry of Defense is the quantitative debate for the 445 kilometres of Zündschnur.
"They cost us sixty percent less than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," spokesperson Pejšek informs us of the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of ignitions by police pyrotechnicians, liquidating the ammunition from World War II or the Soviet brotherly army, has been barely 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that it can consume before the expiry of the duration of use.
As a result of the safety of pyrotechnicians, it is also possible to make flexible purchases more modern and thus also reliable ignorances open.
The Ministry of Defense has huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from times of the Warsaw contract, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, MF DNES addressed, the Czech forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignorance, which she has purchased so "favourable" today.
Until today, the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition
The victorious placement in the competition "Klein businesses of the year" helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
During the last year, Lukaš Pytloun became a winner of the competition "Klein businessman of the year".
The story of his success encourages as a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun was happy to travel.
Only abroad, he realized that there were no good overnight opportunities in Liberec at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and using a bank credit he acquired a building house with five apartments.
If one remembers that he was then a university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous company.
"The price-quality ratio then angryed me and so I tried to do something against it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the whole profit into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in only seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec he has been able to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was recently the 4 star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties at the Franchise of Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the entrepreneur number One of last year.
"Great share of this license sales to operate hotels had just the victory in the competition "Company of the Year", Mr. Pytloun adds recognition.
The victory has brought him more familiarity, even popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"The people recognized me on the street, often congratulated them even afterwards, and I have to say that was really good," he recalls.
I really recommend all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't need to win at the same time, any visibility is good.
He says that he has benefited from the contacts and acquaintances to which otherwise it would not have come.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I have been able to enjoy regular business relations until now."
According to his opinion, the fame associated with the success is also a little down on each of his employees.
And there he has the seventy.
"I notice in them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given general recognition."
I really see this not only as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just something in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
My followers I wish a quieter year than we had it in Farmet
The victory was quickly dissolved by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his desire, Farmet has the worst behind itself.
The prize for the first rank of Vodafone Competition last year took Karel Žůárský, the farmer's company owner.
The jury then appreciated the efforts he made from the small tool building in Česká Scalice to steam a company out of the ground that makes hundreds of millions of transactions.
"I can say that this word has not only encouraged me myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-consciousness in the struggle with competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history, the effort was to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žůárský as a compensation for the property confiscated by the Communist, he didn't hesitate for a long time, let his career in the company in which he was employed so far, and founded with a few comrades of his father's own company for the production of plastic tunnels.
Shortly later, they began to concentrate on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they rose to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only because of the success in the abovementioned competition and its medialization, it also entered into the consciousness of non-competence.
"Not only that our customers have seen the farmet brand more intensely now, our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country to measure greater value," says Karel Žůárský.
Last year, however, farmet was not only in the sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and partly in 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tools.
The crisis, which at that time even less shake citizens, but above all companies, just reached their peaks - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and to restrict the purchase of new institutions and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't escape this situation."
"The turnover decreased by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even take off", explains Karel Ž北árský
A viable company may also have to take such unpopular measures.
However, it succeeded in getting the situation into control and keeping the company in the black numbers, even if with lower profits, than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to cut off - in investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from the subsidy, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired major prizes in domestic exhibitions," says Ž北árský.
Everything proves that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnovers grow again and with them also the number of new employees.
"The new winner I wish a lot of joy at victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel Žůárský guides.
A survey of opinions resolved by unwise regulations
The survey on the "Absurdity of the Year" is part of the entrepreneur's competition for the fourth time.
Some foolish regulations have already succeeded in creating out of the world.
To the doubtful winners of the next year of the survey "Absurdity of the Year", the duty was to create documents on authorities available online.
Thus, more than one third of not entirely four thousand entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have accessed it by two mouse clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the question of opinion.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require extractions from the trade register in the future in the event of controls of social security payments," said the spokesman of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion survey "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all the regulations and orders which entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to fulfil and lift the insane ones.
This year, for the fourth time, this is part of an entrepreneurship competition organised by the Czech Economic News (HN) and enjoys popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there is still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to hinder business activity.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a leading position in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the association of small and medium-sized companies and commercial operators in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic takes the 74th rank in terms of the business conditions, compared to the previous year, one by eight places worse placement.
The competition absurdity of the year was first called in a year and is playing every year after the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic insanity from April to the editorial conclusion of the competition at the end of September.
For registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz is used. Afterwards, the organizer of the competition seeks seven candidates for the "Anti prize" and allows the public to vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that most votes get.
This year's opinion survey has already been registered for more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and orders.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of competition, for example, are provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to pay toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to prepare every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The calling of competition at the Prague Wenzelsplatz at the beginning of November is part of a harp in which personalities of political and public life also regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and commercial operators of the Czech Republic, as well as Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Trade of the Czech Republic at the top of the competition with the party.
"Where the state moves the entrepreneurs between the legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so it is my goal to lift up at least thirty paragrafs each year, which are still unnecessarily difficult to entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create unwise orders from the world show effect.
In 2007, people mostly disrupted the entrepreneurs' duty to report three days in advance to the commercial office in the place of their permanent operating plant, with an exhibition stand to go to an exhibition or Kirmes.
This obligation was repealed by a novel of the commercial law.
The duty to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report services to the Labour Office for up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
In 2009, the regulation, which imposed Physiotherapists, was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personnel watches in the speaking room.
This regulation was somewhat smiled by the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to refrigerator fell away.
A new category credits societally responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year's competition of the economic newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of Vodafon's mobile company, the caller and guaranteed competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
This year's first year of this special subcategory of Vodafon's main competition company reported companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspirative and bow enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ dimensionally in the subject of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator support and consideration.
This is, for example, about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports types.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the isolit-Bravo society, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also carries for its health disabled workers who represent 70 percent of their employees, for whom they were recognized with the title "Responsible Company of the Region of Central Bohemia", and in the Vodafone Company Competition of the year, she held the third ranking in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won a flowing and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours a week and this was without a proportional wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly purchases with Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible to keep the consequences of our entrepreneurial activity and administration to the environment as low as possible," explains her Managing Director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region is again located in the health of its employees and therefore it has created them to all notebooks ergonomic chairs and keyboards, and it also promotes homework in their employees and in business operations it uses carding services offered by a locally protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "Menschen in Not", which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbader region is worth mentioning, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions to nursing, working paths, to increase their qualifications and for holidays," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Schlese region.
On the category of responsible company of the year, all district philosophers of the Vodafon competition were automatically logged in company of the year which answered the questions of the questionnaire filed and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were excluded from the review by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the rival companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "responsible company of the year", but they were not disqualified in the main competition Vodafone company of the year."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible because it is just a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests at a public invitation to tender
In the building of the Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took arrests in the last days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was carried out by the detectives in handcuffs.
It was said to have tried to manipulate a public competition that is currently taking place in order to manipulate restitution claims so that the property offered in the competition could be a specific interested person.
This is supposed to have paid Luboš G. a half million for it.
"I can only confirm at this time that the police persecute a person because of the delicacy of fraudulent acts in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the chief of the Pilsner Prosecutor of the newspaper "Právo", she could not give further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In the way that he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate on this in view of the splendid official information.
The spokesperson of the Lubomír Černá soil fund led to the question of Právo that the police had actually taken arrests in the Pilsner side of the Bodenfonds and this during public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she concreted.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct designation "Requirement for tendering claims for the transfer of land according to the ground law" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons, in the context of the call, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be compensated by the transfer than the requested plot value."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is set, then the soil fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokesman of the Fund.
Luboš G. was obviously available for information who had notified himself on the request and since he was self-authorised, since he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a property interest that he withdraws from the competition.
Obviously against a fat invention.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for the reason why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had all too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the cousa of Václav Sankota's former head of the Václav Sankota so that he was persecuted in criminal law because he had found grounds in replacement restitutions, which had already been delighted in site decisions on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G., for example, acquired lands intended for the construction of public streets, more precisely in the place where the construction of the accessmagistral was planned to the Borské pole industry area.
Later, he exchanged this very favorably with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to give a heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
The household costs rising around a few hundred monthly
The households must not only expect higher costs for all energy types from January, but also higher water and waste water charges and remote heat and many places also grow rentals.
Families will have to pull more out of the wallet as from January to January.
Electricity is getting more expensive by 4.6 percent, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth of more for water supplies and in some places also depict remote heat supplies.
The household costs a few hundred crowns annually.
Strong electricity prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so the strong support for electricity generation from renewable sources, namely photovoltaic plants.
Although gas is only moderately expensive, this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here is a few hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for remote heating vary from city to city.
Priority increases are particularly planned for larger locations.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more monthly for remote heat from January to 50 crowns, more than 1000 crowns more per year paid families in Liberec.
In turn, the inhabitants of Prague are threatening 9 percent of higher water and waste water charges, and this is the case if the city increases infrastructure rentals.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, is still one of the lowest in comparison to all of the Czech Republic.
In the North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and waste water charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Excellent rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will fall away from January.
For example, the CPI Byty apartment company, owned in Ústí nad Labem 2500 apartments, plans to increase the rent by a hundred percent from January.
Anyone who does not agree with this increase in tenants wants the company to have judicial interests.
The regulated rentals, which are still paying in almost 300,000 apartments, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with Fernet and Rum Bier is out - it just works too slow
Fernet, Rum and Wodka, with the exception of a good whisky that you stole the father from the bar.
These are the beverages whose enjoyment of drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen must be most not treated.
No exception are children who have to sleep their cater repeatedly in the hospital.
This is shown by the experiences of doctors faced with similar cases in the inclusion of children's departments of clinics.
"Bier or wine are completely out of fashion because it takes too long until you are drunk."
"The trend today is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the director of the child department in the medieval Hořovice clinic.
"Whisky, if it succeeds to evade a bottle from the housebar, and if not, at least Fernet or Wodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"The most common thing is Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, namely in primary schools."
"Individually, it was also about Slibowitz, who is taken from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to Chief Doctor Pelikán, 13- or 14-year-old drinkers are no exception in hospitalization.
Before the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Pediatric Department of the Hospital of Motol, where the rescue cars were drunk from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"They started her career at the age of 12 when she was first delivered with 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice on any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother did not seem strange that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor wondered.
Especially the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance in urging with their own spouses is considered to be one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
A real dependence in the true sense of the word is, according to experts, not in children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
In those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains Chief Doctor Pelikán.
The speaker of the Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, said that by mid-November about forty drunk children were assigned to the local department for child and youth medicine.
However, only the cases with heavy alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drinked children who are brought home by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police after ambulant treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink a bottle of Schnaps in the school bank, Mr. Pelikán thinks there are three years of amplitudes on which a hundred percent is abandoned: Walpurgisnight, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for distress because of the bad testimony or for joy in the holidays."
"In Walpurgisnight, I have experienced seven drunk children at once", says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better drain than a child who will fight with an unpleasant cater the next day.
The headaches of the morning afterwards, which occur from the dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be driven in the hospital with a fluid infusion with glucose and nutrients missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better on it, because after the "great" experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood without hurting somewhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, at least by injuring the patient the good mood by counting them the costs that it will cost the treatment.
Because the transportation with the rescue car and the night in an acoustic bed come well and enjoy a few thirty thousand crowns.
"Hin and again I used this as a educational tool when I foresee the children directly at the visits, what cost their drinks and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for one such feather," added Dr Pelikán.
However, he believes that the hospitals do not take action by regressive procedures to charge the costs necessary for the healing of drunk children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 of a total of five, who exchanged the Czech Ministry of Defense against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Sevilla on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
It's the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a foreign army.
They had only been seen abroad at Manövern or Flight Shows.
This concerns the flying two-seat version L-159T1, operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three planes are one-seated L-159.
These are currently preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken it over last week.
When it expedits the aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The one-sided L-159 fighter was separated from long-term deposited aircraft, and this was without further deposits and investments from the Ministry's reserve.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to come out without two-seat fighting aircraft, since the Ministry of Defense signed a 200-million treaty with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new plane has taken over the army in July, the second wants to take it until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to implementing the fighting aircraft in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"In the contract, it is clear that the company EADS is operator of aircraft L-159 and that they should serve to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore the purchaser's thing in what way he realizes the matter," said Pejšek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange trade of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was still approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At that time, the Ministry of Defense had not issued a tender procedure for purchasing, but directly addressed EADS.
The former Defense Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 to the foreign countries.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines from which it used only 24, the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of airplanes Casa is expected to have a legal replay.
The European Commission claimed the Czech Ministry of Defense at the European Court of Justice.The reason was that the aircraft had to be selected on the basis of a whole European invitation to tender, and not on the basis of a single manufacturer's responses.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer point finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose pointer fingers are longer than the ring finger are evidently exposed to a lower risk of illicit prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and in particular in men up to sixty years," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at Warwick University.
The finger could help determine which men should be subject to prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Mrs Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer with her colleagues in Britain, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the point finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the likelihood of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of the men whose ring and point fingers were the same.
In men whose pointer fingers were longer than the ring finger, however, this risk fell by 33 percent, in men up to 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already in prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of gender hormones that the child was exposed in the nursery.
Less Testosterone corresponds to a longer show finger.
Previous research revealed that the testosterone is accelerates prostate cancer growth.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech genetics and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said that ČTK is known to him fleetingly, yet he does not consider the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer to date.
Czechia in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, Czechia is also under a snow ceiling on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walkways is mostly steady snow, the winter servicers were all night on axis.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is locked some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
In kilometres 91, a truck crashed, two trucks at kilometers 93, in the case of this accident, were injured.
A few cars are also in the street grave.
There are also problems at kilometers 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks have been collapsed here too.
The drivers should leave Brno at kilometers of 190 or drive over Brno and get up at kilometers of 182 at the town of Kývalka.
There, there, is a mileage of barriers.
Also on the D11 an accident has happened and that is the same at the access to Prague.
In Prague itself is a multiple centimeter thick snow ceiling and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car colons form, for example, in the Prosek district, even the road Štěrboholská is completely hidden.
The safest means of transport is certainly the metro.
The roadways run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis tab meets.
There are also problems with the railway and the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast train connections because of snow.
For example, there are problems on the Prague - Kralupy route or also Prague - Beroun.
The travellers should be aware of the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed from Wednesday to 5 a.m. at 11 a.m.
Most roads in southern Pacific are only available with increased caution.
Around Vyškov, three sideways are totally unfitable, in the surroundings of Brno form snow sweeps, and in the vicinity of Blansko it is forced to use snow freezes on some higher streets.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are three streets still completely locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
You will also have to use snow freezing here.
When they get rid of again, they can't be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of white carpates.
On the roads that can only be stretched with inert scatters for nature conservation reasons, there is a thick snow blanket up to five centimeters, ČTK quoted.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimetres of new snow, most in northern Bohemia, fell up to 18 centimeters.
In the Mährisch-Schlesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it stops cutting slowly.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, which is only known under their code name XM-25.
The Generals hope that this new automatic weapon influences the conflict with the Taliban there and shifts the power ratio in favor.
The new gun is like a super-good cannon.
Because your projectiles are led to the destination by laser with a secrecy of only a few meters.
The special shots of caliber 25 mm, designed for this gun and containing high explosive explosives, work practically like small granates.
The shoots can be programmed so that they can explode at any point of their ballistic aerodrome not only at the start of the goal.
That means that you can use them against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the shelters.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splitter rain from above can easily dispose of it.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new fighting gun is the first infantry weapon that makes "intelligent" technologies useful.
"The soldier is basically doing so: it looks at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins a precise visibility point after which he corrects the increase angle, then he just needs to print off.
"Say, you measured 543 m."
"If you are pushed down, the gun is recharging and shooting the shot to the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are decreasing
The Group of Fujitsu moved its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu moved its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 women and men will move their work from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, which is a large office complex at Lyoner Street in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
One spokesperson of Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the Group should be held there, which were previously distributed to the region.
The offer had been extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park could also better meet the work of the employees.
Fujitsu was also a tenant in Bad Homburg.
The Managing Director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new relocation of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment among the losers.
The Frankfurt Economic Decern Mark Frank (CDU) said that once a "Global Player" was won.
This is a "great-like venue of locations".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburg Supreme Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"We of course offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything to the problems of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at the Marienbader.
Lastly, economic reasons would have been the result.
Now it is a matter of preventing a long lap in such a prominent position.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects of the Kurstadt with the remaining buildings at the Marienbader square ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city street was created between the railway station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the areas previously used as a parking space and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still connected to Siemens, covered the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu Conucers in Tokyo are called the world's third largest IT provider.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employed is Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are supposed to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the 20-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped groundrise - the central association of electrical engineering and electronic industry has its seat.
Amazon saves server - Threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the opening platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is a political pressure behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic issues.
Wikileaks founder Assange is supposed to stay in England.
In the United States, the explosion platform Wikileaks is increasingly under shock.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American senator Joe Lieberman, however, called other countries and companies to the Boykott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileak's founder Julian Assange, who stands on the band lists of Interpol, is supposed to stop after a newspaper report in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks is threatened by Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of the outdoors," the uncovering activists informed Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had withdrawn from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatics in order to deal with the high number of access to the documents.
By Twitter, Wikileaks continued to say: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped the use of his servers by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's employees had been investigating, the TV channel CNN reported in appeal to the Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate Committee for Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a Boykott, reported by the British "Guardian".
"I would have wished Amazon to take this action earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman called on the platform to refuse the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, immense and reluctant action poses our national security and threatens the world's life," said a communication from the partyless senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks distribute stolen materials in his efforts."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is searched for by the authorities in Sweden for rape suspects, stands on Interpol's flag list.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in the United Kingdom continues to be known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigations in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange was right to fear his security, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to be hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had requested that the controller be accused and executed for the Wikileaks revealing for betrayal.
In Canada, a consultant of government chief Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said on television, Assange should be "getted" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, there was a drop-off exchange.
The speaker of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "because of ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had requested the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if it was responsible for recently announced spying demands on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care for a guy's opinion with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The US government now has a comprehensive impact on the protection of its databases.
As a Special Representative, the Vice Director of the Center for Anti-Terror Actions, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House informed.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which had been needed after the release of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that they would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and the most active, they should be in danger by the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to contact them," said Foreign Office speaker Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it should be necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice conditors are being prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest accession and visitors from all over the world.
Where's the whole ice from?
From Gelataio and Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German a little old age of the ice conditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaker art.
The Gelataio picks the ice cream with a spacht from the refrigerator, stretches it into the wafel and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice is not coming by the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice university has established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines will meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest accession and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice and internships in the home-own ice parts.
Some of them dream in the Midlife Crisis of a new career, others just dare on the smooth ice of their vague looks.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, Art Teacher from California, loves slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to do something own after years in a nerve-training job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-based Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also the silence and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the coat of the national and even Southern surgery in his training: "Italy Gelato is simply the best - and then a lot of romantics are still in it."
The first step to manufacture seems very simple.
Luciano picks the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools it to 4 degrees.
Then he turns up a hahn on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, based on all milk ice varieties.
Immediately, the lecturer is polluted with questions: Can you only produce ice cream with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimental pleasure run free?
Luciano warns about letting himself go wrong by the time spirit.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guark meal from the guarbone.
Of course, ice can be manufactured without a stabilizer, but only it must be sold within one day, otherwise it sacks together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Some variations on the ground mass are allowed.
It's gonna be more relaxing with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on you dozens of aromatized additions."
"But you should simply experiment."
Either in the fruitsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just at the ice cream from the white ground mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoaopulver as a basis for all possible chocolate conductions.
Now the course participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additions.
The same experiment is also subjected to fruit ice varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit purse - it's not necessarily better.
Haselnus ice does not necessarily taste more nuisance if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice produces the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture corrects the taste of a Gelato, says Luciano.
ice production is a calculation task: if Pfirsich-Pure is used with lots of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recept.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice.
Luciano draws out a device with which it determines the sugar content of the fruits (winds measure the oggle in the grapemost).
Fortunately, tables make the computer egg easier.
Doing ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the machine for automatic production of the ground mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is struck creamy at the same time and cooled at minus temperatures.
All automation in spite of small pans do not stay out.
The Brazilian Gustavo clothes himself and his classmates from the top to the bottom with fruit curtains when the over-dimensional stab mixer makes it out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "is it only a question of time until this happens."
Inspectors in the dishlight
The European Food Authority Efsa was undermined by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This accusation is now formulating the expert group Testbiotech, which understands itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa experts have been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed substantially to the Efsa testing rules for gene plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, then criticised.
The Efsa regulations are, in the same way, deducted with Ilsi's position documents and thus deceive the industry's manuscript, which is actually to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It's already the second time that Testbiotech devotes an interest collision.
Thus, a high-level Efsa manager has recently been without conditions or transitional time to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and has thus changed the pages.
The Central German Radio (MDR) had also recently revealed personal connections between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which made the Environmental Office brightly hearing as well as EU Parliamentarians.
However, the Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
One takes back all serious data, even those of the industry, as long as they are of high skill quality, says an opinion.
The experts who work for Efsa do not require that they have no contacts with the industry.
But they'd have to open them up.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This refers to itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobby.
In this case, independent experts like Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently authorised without any feeding experiments in animals and the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know, for example, what makes genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins but not the whole gene plant, which did not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how should you find them?", then asks accusing.
Angelika Hilbeck looks like that.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
As in the United States, industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who were not confined with companies.
Critical studies would generally not be published for companies.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he was formed in Stuttgart's train station, the Tuba on his back.
It was Demo.
It's cute.
The story is known: In September the excavators had beaten and had begun to break a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Thirty-thousands demonstrated against S21, the milliard heavy depth of the station.
When it came to the stop of construction, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft crude stone, is built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a few of the bricks.
"These stones are reliquiens."
"You can't get out of here."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he saw one, he smoked for cigarettes.
What he's gonna do with the bricks, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The track of the Stuttgart stones leads in a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone-rich.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those who went to the abriss in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would melt to shit or disappear in the deposit," he says in his office, a wooden bag that once was a watch case.
He was scorned and threatened, he said, when in September in the newspapers, that he bought the remains of the northern wing by the canceller.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for the abbreviation.
And if it happens, then it is the most reasonable if the stones were used on.
Around 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the cuts of 80 kilograms, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some, but also in the hope of giving him back in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck charges.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Häuslebauer.
They had come from everywhere and had dragged away what suitcases and trailers could wear.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long been transformed into "mural" or in limitations of herbal beets.
"Everything, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Don't be the political component."
He rises in his terrain car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of empire.
Jura studied and canceled, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became stone dealers.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stone he stores.
From all over Germany he carries his treasures together.
He says he's the largest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's burning.
In the snow there are articulated sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresdner Marien bridge," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he's warming.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the way through the forest.
He shows on a pile: red sandstein, former part of the Karlsruher station.
And continue.
"Beautiful Travertin."
At one time the quader belonged to the Tribüne of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
All over the snow stones and stories, Cannstatt Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, Red Granit from the Dom Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, which sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones were cut by hand and moved with simple bottle trains and ox cars, it becomes very reverential.
"It would be a scandal if you were to screw such a thing."
He's not rich, he's not rich at all.
But 14 people today are employed by the stone dealers, as well as in the woods, a sculptor, a smith, a glass blower and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the residual evaluator.
He's gonna have to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save.
Language struggle for high potentials
There's rainy Andrang on the buffet.
16 students are pressing about salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the machinery and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they're supposed to know together with VW developers about the car of the future - and all alongside Volkswagen.
In the competition about the smartest heads, many companies are now in the near fight and, like VW, put on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the hearing halls before they come to the labour market and be rebuilt by others.
And because the universities do not publish the performances of their students, they try to get the extraordinary talents in practical projects and bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group throws around the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributed ball crackers, rubber berries and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the corporations.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig carries the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come in contact with the industry and collect experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, approach interesting candidates, and consider who would be in question as an employee."
Such cooperations, as Selle says, are not unusual.
It's new to be so offensive to the students.
"Soon the focus was on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to choose their employees from a large range of candidates.
In particular, they need to pay for themselves and particularly for high-qualified workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiation position.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unsettled in October.
And the so-called engineering gaps will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
For the economic audit and consultancy company KPMG, Roman Dykta is going to the talent hunt.
He organizes experiencing recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern snitzel hunting, where the participants must find their way on the basis of GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the US this next year.
In addition, the participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those with whom they may decide in two rounds of selection in front of them.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many candidates flee into the USA.
As you hang around the high potentials at the universities, the protectives are growing, according to Dykta.
"We want to get rid of the mass with the race."
"Only a simple sailing was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the invoice seems to come up.
"Today we have contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are standing shortly before their conclusion and want to apply with us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct bulk on the campus, small and medium-sized companies are also very classic at professional measurements on the pirsch.
"We're trying to reach graduates at special measurements."
"Etwa on the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, personnel director of Solar Technology Manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the childhood problem.
Currently, 35 jobs are issued on the company website.
"It's just very hard to occupy vacant positions."
"This costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can take practices with us or write his diploma work."
The solar specialist is not charged with expensive advertising operations.
For this, the company tries to recruit itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This can't offer a large group often," says staff manager Stübe.
Money hasn't played the main role in job search anymore.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good climbing opportunities are further crucial factors.
In a study of the Great Place to Work Institute Solarworld, the 55th place was among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute creates an annual Bestenlist of German employers.
To this end, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and look at the conditions for employees.
Staff director Stübe hopes that the placement will also include pluspoints in the job seekers.
"I think that applicants are particularly looking at external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler von der Deutschen Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build up a good reputation as employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers on more authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, mostly internal measures.
"The best way to make himself attractive as an employer is to guide your own employees," he says.
In the industryjargon, the internal employee branding, i.e. employer branding within its own staff.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you handle his people well and identify them with the company, then they would only recruit for their employers and friends.
"This is like a game with bande," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Before the coast of the United States of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A prohibition has been imposed by the government in Washington - and thus finally revoke its previous plans.
Even before the Atlantic Coast, new drilling remains forbidden.
This was an interior minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The explosion of the drill platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April is triggered for the strict prohibition to apply for at least the next five years.
Prior to the disaster that eleven workers cost life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico at pressure of opposition and industry.
The supporters therefore want to reduce the US dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil fever in the Gulf are not finally clarified to this day.
The centre of criticism is the UK energy group BP, faced with billions of requirements.
A Obamas investigation commission is intended to present its results during December.
In October, Minister of Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drill stop after the explosion.
Afterwards, several oil companies had applied for new drill projects at the same time.
Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster with stronger controls and more stringent safety regulations.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been in charge of numerous claims of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama announced to close lucrative tax lubricants for the oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be considerably lower due to a more rigorous regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the largest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consultant company BDO – even before the drill ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains of the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be deferred to further growth.
Ogoniland has been burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the tank station: billions of litres of raw oil run out have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live with theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't stop," the eco-activist calmlys the journalists: "You'll still get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to illuminate a boy to the chest in the water with his surrounding slides: the scene is almost pretty in the rainbow-coloured water glitter.
That under the surface of brown raw oil sulphurs can not be seen.
Earlier, she collected shrimps here, Esther Badom tells them on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty river.
Meanwhile, the slow flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, from a brushed pipeline, a huge amount of raw oil went into the huge moisture area.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to rest six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland located in the heart of the Niger delta is considered one of the worst ruined regions in the world.
On the ride through the mangrove pumps carried through rivers, the whole extent of destruction becomes acute.
Instead of light water, the motorboat winds up brown brews, who dives his hand into the water, draws oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees rage like black lacritical rods out of the ground, sadly let the palms hang their wedded individually.
Bird swarms, as they are otherwise common in moisture areas, are in vain: As soon as the outer board is swept, the former paradise is spreading in a gas station.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari window, "We live in constant danger of health."
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The settlement area of Ogoni has been a battlefield that has been fought for decades: Here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorations from Europe, organised here in the 1980s with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Shell Group had to set up its production in 1993, because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Still today, the company has refused to return to Ogoniland: While from the whole Delta region of the three times size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drill sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines are pumped more than two million barrels of black gold every day, the oil fields in the Ogoniland are broken, the group is too unstable.
All a few hundred meters of stealing sets like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian trees" are called the heads of the drill holes much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of which correspond to the Mark.
Again and again break such a drill head apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of raw oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres have been flown into the delta's ecosystem, according to experts estimates in 50 years: year by year, the amount of oil, as they drifted into the sea 21 years ago at the Havarie of the Supertanker "Exxon Valdez" before Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Anyone who is responsible for the persistent eco-GAU will be argued about it.
While the Shell Group makes sabotage and organized oil stealing responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectors see drilling heads and leak pipelines as the main cause.
In Nigeria, the US scientist Richard Steiner presented much lower safety standards than usual in the world to the Group in 2008: the rate of defects on the lines alone is "to a multiplicity higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-smalled workshop under free sky from the distance, the mangrove shapes appear: they are split and oil-smated up to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily dispersed on the site, a fire flicks: an illegal small refinery.
In the Fass, the oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, petrol is pushing through the pipes into the pot, and later, at the end of the kerosin line, and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels Diesel à 300 litres daily: "That brings us 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The Deltabe residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low diesel price with almost 40 euro cents per litre can still be lowered by the illegal cookers: because their raw materials are in vain.
It comes from "Bunkerers", which occupy the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts, at least 16 million litres of raw oil are lost every day, every day.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisionally intermediate raw material is illegally depleted: the lion's share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, fills in tankers and swallows it on the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is rather debted to the reversal of the population or the lax production method, considers that the activist Akpobari is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not to observe as intruders and would not have destroyed the fishermen's life base so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, the relationship between the Ogoni and Shell was so devastated that only a deduction of the Group could be questioned: "There may be other nationalities like the Chinese."
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"High time for you to disappear," says the muscular oil man.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil spoilers are caught by the special unit of the forces, they are not threatened to arrest, but maybe a painful lubricant.
Also, the soldiers from the native government, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw material.
"This fucking stuff has brought our country to the dog in every respect," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction errors in A380 drives
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error in the investigation of a newly landed machine that could lead to a "casstropical decay".
The Qantas flight line now wants to complain to the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the not landed Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November seemed to have known much more happiness than until now: the Australian Air Safety Authority has found a major security problem in the engines of some A380 machines in their investigations - and now warns against a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose, he could produce tiredness and lecks, it was said in a opinion published on Thursday by the Authority ATSB.
This could have resulted in "a catastrophic waste of engines."
The engines produced by Rolls-Royce were affected in 20 A380 aircraft.
This is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal steps against the British turbines manufacturer.
She gave a appeal to an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing him to take further legal measures against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said that his airline would demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had been dissolved and the drag surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines must now be exchanged worldwide.
The Australian authors announced to carry out further safety tests to the Superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The safety problem has been considered sufficiently important in order to inform all the persons concerned.
Following the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of his eleven A380 on the ground.
The airhansa switched the engine in a A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-story flyer is the world's largest passenger aircraft.
National snowfall dissolves traffic chaos
Germany in White: Overnight snow has fallen almost all over the country.
Chaos, trains and flights are on many roads.
In car accidents, at least three people died.
Winter frost Germany: At ice temperatures, almost all the Republic is cut to Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east there are partly 15 centimeter thick snow covers.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was permanently used, but was not finished with the constantly revising snow.
In addition, heavy winds fought over the Baltic Sea Coast.
The Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) is expected to be at the Baltic Sea Coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning to storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal stand.
In Saxony, snow destructions on the highways and federal roads led to major problems.
According to the weather central meteomedia, in Saxony Switzerland, alarm level was violett – the highest level at all.
Partly, there fell 30 centimeters of nozzle, fresh and strong winds caused distortions.
There were several trucks and cars in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to steady traffic and strain.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, crashed trees on the rails or destroyed upper lines and pastes are the main problems.
In Saxony, distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be suspended.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, a ICE to Munich had to stop his ride.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemen and rescueers with wool covers, foods and drinks in the train.
Snow winds fought over the streets.
In large German airports, snowwinds lead to numerous flight failures.
According to a spokesman of the flight information centre, a number of cancellations have already been reported in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a fraport speaker, 40 flights have already been deleted.
Winter service is permanent.
Although only a few disadvantaged passengers are at the airport, almost 400 bunk beds are still available for them.
On many streets there were accidents on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver came to life at the collapse with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The runner was easily injured.
Near Nuremberg, because of snow-covered streets, there was a similar accident: a truck was also recorded on a railway pass because the vehicle stayed.
The driver died.
In the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked until the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overlapping her car with Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
But the meteorologists have a good news: although the snow will still be loose and pulvery and therefore already beat up with light bows.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is plagued by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - ordinarily up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its true sign: According to a newspaper report, the money house buyers are looking for the two office towers at their Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros, the property could bring in.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters nice: The twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernised; the bankers have now been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group seems to want to recover the cost of renovation again - and look for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes on a spokesman under appeal.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it is more useful to own or sell real estate itself and then to rent back," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution has returned its company seat after a short period of time.
The Bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a home-own fund and subsequently renovated intimately.
The energetic reconstruction swallowed the data according to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the newspaper's towers that are now renamed "Greentowers" to some 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, are still open at the moment, the speaker said.
Thousands Wedding For Dead Couple
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand thought of the scattered miners who were declared dead after several explosions.
Still, the bodies could not be secured because the safety situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth, there was a severe explosion.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were disposed of under days.
A sin had been dropped into the calamity shaft but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to decline for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no more chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies couldn't be protected until now.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial celebration.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island at a radiant sunlight.
They'll stay for two minutes.
In honor of the scattered miners, 29 tables were placed on which helmets, lamps and the names of the comrades were seen.
Images and personal items, including clothing and surf boards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags wounded to halfway.
New Zealand hoped that the miners "from the depths of the earth" would come back to the surface, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the Memorial celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son as long as he did not see his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was shed in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial celebration.
At the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also disposed of.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases have been drowned, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
To hell, warriors!
Does Plater fit the Art Kino?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn, with his fighter epos "Walhalla Rising", re-established old genre limits.
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his pineiers and with almost superhuman forces turns around his opponents - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rabiate killing methods and his enemies even rides the grains of the living body when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge says, as it is actually called, the whole film by no word, and also the other figures can be zipped up to one or two sentences or a few painful death shouts.
Otherwise, it is swept and swelled in the hugely beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which offers the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideally for adult cinemas with interest in existingism and very quiet camera trips.
Beautiful if a film has several target groups, only harm if they exclude each other.
Regisseur Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" but refuses to make his works with a little more humor accessible to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the arthouse.
Most of the artistic kino friends are likely to be scared from the sprinkling brain mass around and the barriers.
The action fans die at the latest before longevity, when an eye breaks up with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem for freely interpretable reasons and sets an eternity in fleet and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to sweat there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a shame because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretensive to bloody façade, a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hidden, which deserves some attention.
In this film it is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film-made fever room.
And out of it there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn doesn't give him a moment of relaxation, and with his ice-like pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, he is slow to the throat, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blessed boy who is faithful to the side of an eye keeps something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Mostly the one-yield hero whose motives are never explained, but who becomes the warrior from hell for enemies and temporarily allies sometime, perhaps to the ambassador of the Devil itself.
He means corruption, but maybe only for those who have been corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is a ridiculous film that can be hated and admired, for anger, uprising and amazement.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new references to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country is refusing to take a position to do so - it also allows controls.
At midnight, on 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighting aircraft attack a mysterious, worm-shaped building in Syria.
It is on the shore of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor, which Syria said has built with the help of North Korea in the quader, hidden in a valley that departs from the electricity.
According to a lettering of the US foreign secret service CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearest town el-Kibar, would have been well suited to generate plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, however, technology from the fifty years is hardly sufficient.
The CIA presented a video presentation with unscharved satellite images.
By computer animation, she embraced where the reactor's components should have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos that show the building out of the vicinity or even the interior.
The reactor had stood shortly before the operation, it was said, but had not yet been fitted with burning sticks.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is barely more known than at that time, yes, the puzzles became much bigger in time.
The former US president George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar but hardly saw evidence that there was an active nuclear weapon program in the country.
Some intelligence ministers in Europe prefer to be more cautious and speak only of a "consuming reactor", even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor in front of himself, a high UN diplomat in summer answered only lapidar that IAEA has "please of material to ask questions".
The shelter of the alleged "unused military building" made the Syrians quickly on the side and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by people.
In addition, IAEA received commercial providers from a Member State to satellite images directly after the attack which was supposed to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings cannot be obtained on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always regretted having never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The Uran came from the Israeli weapons, Damascus declared.
However, after the analysis of the particles, IAEA rejected it as unlikely.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss it - as did the satellite images.
In addition, it refuses to the controllers a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the broken building.
But Israel also sways.
"We will never comment," recently confirmed the official position of Premier Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
Thus, since June 2008, the investigation of the case has been uncovered and "developed increasingly into a serious credibility problem for the Authority," as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA seat in Vienna, a serious violation of the nuclear arms blocking agreement is in the space over which the IAEA guards.
As a key to progress in the education, IAEA seems to see three other institutions to stand "in functional connection" with the suspected reactor - and still exist differently from them.
The inspectors have not so far revealed what plants are, what function they have or what they appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are called Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah at the IAEA internally, departed from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and found a building complex on satellite images at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military support point - exactly with this reason, Syria refuses access to the three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was presented by the US to spoil military facilities.
Because the nuclear electrons had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the US secret services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photographs, that between the three places and the quader on the Euphrat material was transported and transported.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there are "no indications on sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come and where the plutonium should later be separated for the bomb, there are at least plausible suspicions on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could mountain valuable traces have been stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads were disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the shelter has stayed.
The salt mine al-Tibni, which is located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrat, which Syria has examined in 1998 as a warehouse for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely to be the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently contacted her in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria took earthwork in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but has hardly contributed to eliminating the suspicion.
In addition, in diplomatic circles, IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - just the effort shows the importance of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If western diplomats in Vienna were still suspicious a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter has no high urgency, some US messenger Glyn Davies has been playing so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the worst means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA-Chef Yukiya Amano, who had to suggest these inspections, has already spoken of "a option for which I am open in the future," but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs a majority in the Governor Council of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than demanding for escalation.
On the other hand, how a diplomat considers: "What if they don't find anything at the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still unnamed regiment in summer, there is trouble.
The script has written herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
A lot more you don't know about it, but that's enough for trouble.
The rumour, the woman, a Muslim, is in love during the Yugoslav war in her Serbian rape.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, whereby some of Sarajevo's planned turning days were moved to Hungary in short term.
In the meantime the film has been turned down in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about UNHCR refugee aid to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is himself ambassador of the UN refugee aid.
She is not diplomatic - she has offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not existed, and Jolies' attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to its organization, the UN refugee aid has recommended to release Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given her screening, has, after some hin and Her, granted a rotary permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author himself regrets that she does not follow political intentions with her film, have worked with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, it remains vague when it comes to content.
Thus, another synopsis to the film in the network, which sounds quite differently: The lovers already knew themselves before the outbreak of war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are dragged into a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different from the variant "Vergewaltigungsopfer stumbles in torture servant".
That Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, as Jolie said, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you may only be able to provide the hackers of Hollywood with peace: by putting the script illegally into the network, as many of them before.
Nothing like gone here.
That evening, it's finally running around for the Irish.
No trace of distress.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans shout for joy in cracking loud music, they stabbed with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the Southern Ireland Cork is occupied because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer becher - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle to win, there are 500 Euro victory plus tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this crilled drinking game and the restraint informatician, which does not really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself to distract itself from the boring question what will bring the future.
On his plan, there is no fun in Las Vegas, he will be in New Zealand in January.
"I have a multitude of feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I don't have any work there."
After all, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "she had cheated her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: Like the tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100.000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, experts of the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin predict.
By 2015 they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of migration similar to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of uprising, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, it is now spreading trips.
The economic crisis in particular disastrous the young, well-trained Irish, for which it has so far only gone up.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the tree years.
Everyone was needed, there was plenty of money.
But in the meantime, three of ten women and men under thirty are without work.
In the Irish Times there are readers of young immigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the stream in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but whoever can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one please turns out the light."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future, because the government only operates eyewhey and does not offer the young people any future prospects.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her communes hang from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to migratory itself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to place the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a round-round service on work abroad.
"For professional beginners, work abroad is a great chance to make the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfer in Australia and snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galaxy service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has been aware of how it feels elsewhere.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are just moving up a fashion house.
In January, it goes on to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
His homeland is still rarely seen by O'Donovan, because he makes extra layers to pay the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, when after a long time he gets over the threshold of his house for the first time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as never more."
He laughs a little shy and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept gardens, parking large, expensive cars in the entrances.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit financed.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could be wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I have no children I have to feed through and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from new."
The construction engineer doesn't like the pain he's hearing at this time.
"Nobody has to hungry - our situation is far from as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps we feel only as Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, very easy."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Open the future and just see how it goes with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he's already behind himself and why should it not run well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
One thing, however, is still there that is concerned about him in these days: the celebration to his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could break into a life-sufficiency party.
"Don't stay too much emotions," he says and drinks a big swallow from his beer.
"Of course, that sounds anxious."
"Let's call it a way party, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democrat Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than the United States.
The Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries, was published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly visible in this year's survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong breakdown last year, such a trend is to be seen.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populated countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (see diagram 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents explained that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, as are as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of its government. Both values correspond to that of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This also continued during the world economic crisis may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(Laut reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week in 2009 increased the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and fell again by 32% this year.)
But from country to country there are strong mood differences (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the separate President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects in a widespread thought of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violence has increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the beginning of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see a greater problem in their country than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
Approximately 31% say that they themselves or a family member have been victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of the respondents overregionally indicated that the private economy is indispensable for development, in 2007 there were 56% (see diagram 6).
Approximately 58% explained that only the market economy can make progress to its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have retained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left President, Hugo Chávez, states many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has followed the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
On the other hand, in Mexico and most countries of Central America, the most influential country is seen in the United States, taking this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A Choice Sleep
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28th.
However, the facts exceeded the fears of the Electors who rushed to the land to help.
Overfilled electoral walls, several votes delivered, electoral certificates in the Rinnstein, destroyed electoral locations and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Election sites opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, struck around looking for a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen candidates of presidency, including some suspicious leaders, demanded the cancellation of election results due to a alleged fraud.
There were partially violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN Mission in Haiti, described the choice "as quite good in many interests".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "this irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly obliged to the unpopular President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected pick-up is reserved for January.
There is still hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invaluation complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no consent with the voters, explains from the electorate to the winner of the vote, this could lead to problems.
Due to cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims are still living in tents, a small participation was feared.
On the day of election, many Haitians were prevented by lack of organization in voting.
Shortly before the beginning of the election, about 250,000 instructions needed for choice were not yet distributed.
It's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government an important step in reconstruction of Haitis.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Homely in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, which pushed their popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since their election in 2007.
However, if you are helping this to re-elect the next year, it depends on whether Cristina Fernández is more promising than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who, even after his wife's choice, directed economic policy, often set up budgetary plans that did not take full account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President-in-Office to spend the extra revenue according to his own vouchers.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority of the convention last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 resulted in further disruptions.
Some regime critics from the governing peronists were behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentarian struck to another face and rejected the government of bribery), the convention did not succeed in adopting the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the next year, making the President more opportunity to spend money on its own.
The economy is running hot: it will probably grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate, for example, is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage requirements for trade unions - are worth almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office when Argentina was shaken by economic crises in 2003, declared growth and poverty fighting for its main goals, not the reduction in in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, shackled the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Volkszähling INDEC, which then enjoyed official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate way?
She called on the private economy and trade union leaders to talk.
According to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% in the next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth gap by a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to join Argentina financially again to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government met an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's former debt in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to push on an agreement with the creditors from the Paris Club, to which she debt about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
However, last month, Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in creating a new national consumer price index. It looks as if this was the first step to clean up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of its term of office, even without the support of her husband.
If so, she needs the support of the middle layer, which mostly has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holiday in March, the wave of sympathy that has been brought to her will have been abandoned.
If she wants to make another choice, she must decide if she is silent and silent for her husband's many political decisions.
Bad applause for China
Taiwan's elector slowly approaches a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother beyond the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all voters, opened to choose in the five city districts of Mayor and Town Councils. This is evaluated as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Ma itself is a symbol for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese native country for the first time since 1949.
Ma's got the test, but only scarce.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she received no majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP) which advocates greater independence in Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In the case of a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the share of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils along with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual incidents in Taiwan such as truck convoy with crownmakers, flag-swinging mass conversions and only sparkly clothed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honour chairman of the KMT held a speech on the eve of the election on a KMT candidate,
when a man shot him in the face of the crowd. Line was wounded and a surrounding spectator killed.
Bizarrativ is not clear whether the shooter would kill line or join a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the choice and put the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has given more voices.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland have not been discussed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their factual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to focus on its relations with the Government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also avoids shaving the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new consciousness that Taiwan's economy without China could not survive.
Ma, on the other hand, wants to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese are in favour of its China policy.
The Government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives into the Community.
China immediately sent an entrepreneur to Taipeh to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but the most important first.
It would rather wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now re-invented.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was committed to absolute independence.
But under Tais Regentship a new generation of resident politicians developed and the DPP fighted for the votes of professionals and youth.
Tsai found great consent as presidential candidate of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea smith as a contact point between the DPP and China. This, however, requires prejudice-free discussions.
Tsai publicly explained that their party offered a "trusted alternative" to Mas pre-accurate approach to China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to stand on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged Pragmatian Su to abandon the presidential candidateship.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is difficult to choose their potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election fight without it.
The main reasons for his inpopulation seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing distress between poor and empire.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports reconciliation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there's no more back."
Grammy nominations: The Jazz singer Esperanza Spulding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
If you arrive at a president's request, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to appear at the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize Award Award. Now the 26-year-old Jazz Bassistin and singer were overwhelmingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrating star since its 2008 album "Esperanza" in the Jazz scene, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules, after which an artist may have published the album, with which he has been known in the wide public, up to three albums.
Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her vocal voice and a good sense of pop, radio and Latin Music, you can easily compare Spulding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 comes the next in this category of nomination Spaldings.
The album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the category of instrumental albens. This resulted in a giant success.
Iyers' competitors include "Moody 4B" of the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where, otherwise, albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue was welcomed in the category of large groups. He thus responds to the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in the classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53nd Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestras with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectical orchestra, with three voices.
Among the nominates with connections to Southern California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and launched in 2009 at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
This year five artists were nominated in the category of classical producers - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums, Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concert Building Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" are played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, Bergs "Lulu vom Orchester des Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chor of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Sheddrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy were nominated.
Pärt's symphony No. 4 was launched and recorded in the Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The ca. 30-minute piece wears the title "Los Angeles" and is the former oil magnet Mikhail Chodorkowski, who sits in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinenkonzert" received a nomination in the instrumentalsolo category with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestra advertisement for recording the works of Strawinskis with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumentalists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violin Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie of Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Precisionx and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Klassik-Crossover, Soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula gains consent from the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Criticians proposed the project to promote terrorism as well as traffic.
However, according to a statement from the Commission from Wednesday evening, the new religious center meets the local provisions and will become an aesthetic view.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As a American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice exists."
"There are few opponents," he added.
"You're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The session began at 18:00, and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost to midnight, with the votes on both sides were quite equally distributed according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no longer America," a commentary.
"It is another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in sand."
"American is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violence.
His municipality with about 135 families has lived peacefully for years in Riverside County, but they wished a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filtering facilities.
The new 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style is supposed to have two minarettes and become about 13m high.
It is intended to be built on about 17.500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbes could enable new forms of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterial type that can live by arsen, among other things, opens new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements that have been considered necessary so far.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to wake either phosphorus or arsens."
"This makes it a very special thing, although it is almost a kind of 'friend' life form," Paul C.W. Davies from Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as the scientists found, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake grows even further if it replaces phosphorus with arsen.
"There is a question what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, so embarrass.
The study relates to microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details on the discovery have been announced, gave rise to widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could act from discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms in other planet systems can launch biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements' which we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a Novum because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA astrobiological Institute, which led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to the high level of arsenic.
Since Arsen and phosphorus were chemically similar, she assumed that microbes who are both exposed may replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly based on the chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so big that Arsen works differently than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system where it almost smashs everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exhibited the Bacterium GFAJ-1 of an increasing arsen concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsens shows that a arse-based life form can naturally occur either on earth or on another planet or moon on which arse is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsen is not new, but there has not yet been a working example.
Arsen appeared more frequent in the early years of earth, she says, so science assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life can also have developed differently than in the early era," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simons Research Team.
The research was supported by the NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health.
Rest of stolen exhibition school found in Compton
According to Los Angeles County Sheriffs, the other two of the four exhibition schools stolen before a Bellflower motel were found from Thursday.
The four exhibition schools – two acitas and two pembroke Welsh Corgis – disappeared on Tuesday, as unknown to steal the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 nights, said the authorities' statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two were discovered on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well up," says Whitmore.
"You're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legal owners."
Whitmore did not make accurate information about the dog's location or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say to this," explains Whitmore.
"We follow some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs in a district animal home in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Representatives of the Sheriff found the delivery car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3 - year-old row, and Didi, a 10 - month-old dog, were unrestrained according to the authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners on the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard living in Redding were in the city this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times reported on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dogsaw to dogsaw.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their delivery car in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxerwelp, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with them in their motel room.
The thickly acitas and Corgis remained in the delivery car because it was cooler there.
They let the window open a split wide so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car as stolen on Tuesday at 6:00.
Peek promised anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis a finder reward. The animals were implanted for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet known whether a finder pay is paid.
The lion re-breaks after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainties, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a new-York bankruptor offizieled the "prepared" crew plan to cut off the debts of $5 billion and to set the way for new films and television shows to the 86-year entertainment company.
According to the Thursday statements, the plan meets the requirements of the US Concurrence Law, so that the reboot of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglas Entertainment, will no longer be in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will preside as the main business leader for the slightly speculated studio.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually does not enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond of $500 million for the financing of the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself incurs $75 million, leads the company. Financing is supposed to stand by mid-December.
In May 2009, the restructuring of the studio began to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company's management, which fighted with interest payments of $300 million/year, to solve their financial problems.
In August, Chief Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO with Enron and restructuring experts, known by his activities at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve the financial care of MGMs and pay out the more than 140 creditors of the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In spring this year everything began from the front when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 monthly for the management of the company, receives a "competitive bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio produced only one film and created a year plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films for "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which should be created under the director of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried a fusion of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keep your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can get a significant hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic spring rods or about 48 doses of Play-Doh.
But you can clean up your gift budget.
Recently I visited three electronic toys under $80 – a Wal mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, a broader offer is found on the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button cells-operated toys come to the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plumbing figures, as large as sea pigs that sing a note when you press on their abdomen.
Press one time corresponds to a note, by multiple pressing you can play a song.
Several singers sing in harmony.
Attention: If you have started pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interchange games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel scarfs with wheel blocking she masters the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, your parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back there (Hasbro/Play School, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires that can be a driving time to a lesson, with a better exchanger with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty table. However, the games contained therein are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is first large revision of the Leapster series with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for the games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card run can also be viewed family photos on it.
Finally, there is still Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a string wooden box and have a own LED screen.
The game is about to put the blocks together in words before the time expires. It is great for an improvised bookstabier competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in the Club Penguin, you can, for example, buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
This can be wheel shoes or a puffle pet.
The latest head cell-operated microrobots, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not bigger than the head of your tooth brush.
The beetle moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him out of monasteries through a misgarten.
And he's gonna stop some things.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China become gentler
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a urban place, checked his nervous submissions and gave orders with military authority and damp voice.
He wanted that his female members of Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary racisms and their slope to violence - impress the viewers.
"Gerades stand!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "How lovely girls are like this!"
Four girls, hardly grown up to the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers stood tremendous.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight row.
Four decent hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loops.
"They look like an average for me," Mr. Tang notes lowly.
"Models are nice."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city all new candidates must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low stars: According to 50 officials, in 2009, they were surrounded by an incorrectly established imbis car and stared on the operator until it packed in after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a town district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police strides. They have been selected specially because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the rough police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to implement urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008 officials in the province of Hubei struck a spectator to death when he filmed her with his cell phone as they hit a protest against a waste shell.
Last year a training manual was stolen and published on the Internet by Beijing officials. It describes how criminals can be pushed without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai watermeloon dealer suffered brain injury after a handpiece with five officials.
A stupid video game that can be downloaded from the Internet before violence shows trained officials in China when attacking street dealers.
"Chengguan fears the government," said the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy on tactics.
The newspaper demanded "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics are inadequate in the current approach.
When the district searched for eight female recruits in October, a editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to job display, women from 18 to 22 years of age were searched for with good figures and "harmonious faces".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment ratio ends with 26 years of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too exercising.
"The most important is their image," said an unnamed district officer at the quasi government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job, first depends on their outer appearance, such as size, weight, facets, etc."
Then come Temperament and "inner qualities".
"Wise chengguan are like flower vases," he said and added, "but they also have other obligations."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the City Administration of the District, does not want to join this description,
However, admitted that in China, size standards in job displays for both sex are not inexperienced.
The same applies to equal facets.
Whether this is a good look, it is controversy in China.
But people with disabilities or physical dispositions do not need to apply.
"We can't use any lame or buckligens here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, patroled on the Baoguang place near a monastery, is 22, has apple bags and a well-formed mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that her appearance is so much valued.
"Find, I look out in this uniform sexy?" she asks with ironic views.
Her colleague commented with the Grübchen, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude because they have more ambitious career plans than simply shake merchants through the gases to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strike covers about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many bread and towel dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before they are hunted.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have already said this so often!" explains Mrs. Xu to a dealer who had fleeed on foot and had temporarily left his nudel kitchen mounted on a bicycle car.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than tiresome.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20 who studys sales in leisure time.
"All routine."
One reason is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the dealers, such as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male officers.
This is intended to protect them from public contradictions that are frequently exposed to officials in China.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, were killed by Chengguan officials after the germ was classed.
More than one dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured during the night incident, 14 government vehicles were cast or burned.
Xindu has been spared from such violence so far.
But there are no distresses.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patroled this morning, gathered more than 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired instead of at a workshop, contrary to the rules on the burgeon.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of retirement, the officials went on the way to their vehicles with a cruel face and continued with the motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of male strain, remained back. He turned his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes, we're going to be arranged."
"Sometimes, but also physically," explains Mr. Li.
"The most of the time the people start with the dispute."
Prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the accusations that were raised against him after his Affaire with a former Elector and his attempt to provide a lobby against her husband, the lawyers of the Senator announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal warranty against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which provided for headlines across the country and put a steamer in his career, he was considered to be a possible presidential candidate of the Republican for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "heavenly pleased" after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate’s ethics committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were discontinued and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. According to your opinion, there were sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents opened in the New York Times for the first time in October 2009 led to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electors, helped to buy lucrative orders to buy his silence over a Affaire with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was a master of treasure during a election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and hearings, he took over for them after Hampton's lobbying.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to take a lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, close to friendship before the Affaire, was contrary to the so-called ban on the rotary door cycle.
According to the published Indians, "it seems to deal with an agreement and the violation of the rotary door statues," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specialized in the defense of clients who are in the government's vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to declare the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethicans said that the Ministry seemed very careful in taking political charges after a variety of defeat persecuted by the media with great interest, including the last year's decision to drop the charge against the former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Advocate General Melanie Sloan, Chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the US parliamentary and government circles), said a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr Ensign in court.
"This basically means that high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another day in which he was told that the Ministry would not raise any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, the senator "has acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I don't think I'm going to talk details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much is said: we believe that we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to initiate the investigations for a separate appeal by the ethics group after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr Ensign's parents to the Hamptons against the Federal Election Act had violated.
The Election Commission said there wasn't enough evidence that the money had been something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who long supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyist work.
An e-mail of December 2008 proves that after Mr. Hampton was a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's bossman, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "indoor" for a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also appointed with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to agree a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had stopped for lobbying.
Last year, for the first time, information about this issue came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized with his electors and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been in the fourth position of the Republicans.
After he had not noticed many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he wanted a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer is the goal of police research, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, said that the Senator hopes that the ethics commission will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set up its investigations very quickly.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calls make attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them dipped into the crabs in the courtroom.
In the minutetact, they sent their reports on horrible witness statements on Twitter.
At the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process of rape and bed chained children in a house that was in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully followed process by Steven J. Hayes, who had been accused of having killed three members a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's ruling on the death judgment that the jury has pronounced.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed applications to courts, explain the reasons for an appeal and the courts will deal with years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that through the intensive reporting of the process, including through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters, it had come to a "circasat atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of excitement details, so that the jury had been inadmissiblely influenced by public disarmament.
This objection could cause the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies need new rules in the court hall.
"As I have experienced it during this process, I believe it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Chief Defender.
The presidency judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, rejected the requests by decision last week shortly and terminated when he said that the new media would be "safely controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court claims have found that the reporting on famous-berated cases has caused doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States revoked the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Easteopathee from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that because of the new media, there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom".
Some believe that the television series and the film "On the Flight" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court claims, which Mr. Haye's condemnation considered half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communications paths from the court hall which were still unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be disturbed about the influence of the new media in processes persecuted by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is only one of many who present the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
For example, the defendants also claim that Mr. Hayes could already have been prejudicialized when judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel Tatortfotos during the jurors selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their breeder, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have filled them with abomination.
The defendants say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge has falsely exchanged a lawyer who had been a critic of the prosecutorship, and that he had unauthorized pressure on the judgment when he had made the unexorable decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments on the influence of detailed reporting on the process may be the greatest interest.
In a judgment contest which they submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidate during the election campaign for the Governor's Office and the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously re-established the flames of emotions about the case.
"A such daily Andrang of the mediapieces, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "wasn't yet experienced in New Haven and perhaps even in the country before."
Your focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more prevalent than reports that are slower, is a technic opposing view that impairs reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts were often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes need adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers strengthen this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the verdict of Dr. Sheppard was repealed because of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "representes Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign on swamp words and negativeness this week little courtesy has broken out in Washington.
Is it Omening a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return quickly to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the tops of the Congress did not break through the major questions that had to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no more decisions were taken.
After all what one hears, it was not a polite discussion between two different pages, nor a respect for their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party-point collection.
At the same time, the public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission was civilised on Wednesday, despite the political differences that continue to exist between Members.
It seems to be clear that close interaction will create a mutual respect over a period of months, which will keep the ideological gap that continues to separate the members.
This is hardly enough to claim that it was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise willingness is required, while one itself tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a further party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's about taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are kilometers away.
Lastly, the November election Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
"No question, the soundfall has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections awaken party passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially in those on the agenda of the lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have hardly a different choice than to find a solution."
Bush's tax reductions end at the end of the year, and no one supports this.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment allowances is to be expected, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favoured tax reductions for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these questions during the "lame duck session" and at the same time also ratify the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston des Brookings Insitution warns that successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session must not lead to a permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress will be launched in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-consent is more likely, perhaps even inadequate.
"After the things that must be done, this short-term psychology will be turned into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is divided by many - leading the courtesy to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today to 2012 as a pre-competition, or shadow boxes, for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party elections whose education was active.
Whatever the Republican leaders may be concerned about pokering too high, they know that they have to try to reduce their promises to reduce the government's expenditure and to dispose of health reform.
The first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission are already made clear, which include a tax reform and the increase in certain taxes, as well as an increase in the pension age and a reduction in government expenditure.
Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own opinion, so much urged to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission in order to make their plan an official recommendation, and they are fighting very much in order to reach the nearest number.
The largest resistance is found in the chosen representatives of the body, since financial issues, at least today, are little space or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans at the Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party conflicts when the Republican Obama challenges with regard to the state budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proved that despite the partyability of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a sackgasse, as happened in 1995, then both parties must take care of the public response.
Anyone who is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be a optimistic way of view.
Participation and polarization are now bigger than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Congress republics than they were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see in 2010 as a pure pre-play for a far wider selection of 2012.
This is how many Americans welcome the courtesy that this week is presented.
But on both sides, it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the questions that continue to separate the two from each other.
Through-chicked US document portraits Moscow as the port of corruption
The city's control is located in the hands of the "Kleptocration" and it gives a part of the bribe payments and the protection fees it collects to the Kremlin. In February, the American message in Russia reported in a memo.
Both police and the State Security Service are expressing high protection funds so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimated transactions, but also from organized criminal bands.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "Vertical of Authority" - takes its part of the money that the head is moving upward.
The memo sent under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle to Washington was published on the Tuesday of WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names were edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that in the meantime he had been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption claims over years, and he has won numerous blasphemy charges against such accusations.
In September he explained to a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentation suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's frightened, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, which has resulted in surveys.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is unheard that this happens through a diplomatic of a foreign country.
"The direct link between Moscow's government and crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and conclude that the government is more like a cleptocrat than a government," says the Memo.
Criminal elements enjoy a "crashna" (a term from the world of the criminals / the Mafia, which is literally "dach" or protective), which extends through the police, state security (FSB), the service authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government office.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within Moscow's criminal world.
"Luzhkov is in the top position."
"FSB, MVD and Miliz are on the second stage."
"Recently follow the ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors at the lower stage."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gamble because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and arrests small businesses by the police.
One source, so it is, "explained that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not of organized crime), as they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"For this reason the protection by criminal gangs is no longer as demanded as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the money is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don't pay find their business very quickly closed - due to one or other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time he has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucratics," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of forces, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, according to the estimate, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is placed on place 154 of a recent study on global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt".
The uncovering of the Memo of the American Embassy, which happened late evening after Moscow's time, will certainly cause misfall within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's mistakes, it can also be an opportunity for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a counterfeit and responded to the unveiling that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to be arrogant with such arrogance, with such pressure and so unethical, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront with the past
In a weakly illuminated classroom with dirty and blazing walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it to the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the slaughterer", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Highburg in the northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer Rouge against the government, long-standing followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation allowed victims public confrontation with those who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book, which for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of Khmer Rouge.
And in July a community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia first sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when it condemned the former Chief of the renowned Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fears of the Khmer Rouge Veteranen Alnlong Vents grew, weakened their efforts to reconciliation and reintegration in Cambodia's society.
"There is still a rejection and anxiety in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For her life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese fled and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remains of the regime and his military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread up to December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, turmoil.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok approached the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a 1993 UN peace agreement led to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to go over to the government, which led to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died of a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given up, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his trial.
When their gods no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the degrading poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few of the military officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng
"They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before leaving in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice builder.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Take mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also awakened anxiety here.
At the beginning of the next year, the court will try to put Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to mildening the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have concentrated on In Chaem, 64 years, which had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodia Documentation Centre representative that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project where thousands of forced workers were likely to die.
On a hot evening The Chaem returned from work on the fields to their wooden house on a dirty road outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the darkened grass, In Chaem, it refused to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court invites her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, here would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was fled by the Khmer Rouge in 1878, also repeatedly warned that the situation would be insecure, the court would accuse more suspicious, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Company with the Khmer times means merging the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so that as everything can understand."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page history of the Democratic Cambodia.
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages over the Khmer Rouge.
As often as in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gaining continuously influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Upstairs in the Dangrek Mountains, one of the bushes leads overcrowded and with plastic waste-driven paths to a rectangle of black ruth, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile seller on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will drop a bush mature bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
White-Russia agrees to continue collecting non-appropriate uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for the worldwide protection of nuclear materials, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that one will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to collect no longer high-rich uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But officials of the US government told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements were met with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of gun from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations" from April which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation from the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012).
"This proves me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is fundamentally weaponous, and less enriched uranium," Lukehenko said at that time.
"This is our raw material, we won't make any dirty bombs from it, and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the USA a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first start to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly radiated, say officially.
It was loaded into a special move for more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officially.
The second start was decided on Monday and was carried out by aircraft according to the official.
The US government pays $14 million for these efforts, where much of the money flows into Belarusian research with weakened uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely cautiously coordinated and coordinated to build confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, working on the Global Danger Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Forward Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium this year.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its warehouse until 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the USA have been enthusiastic for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's disregard of human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"To welcome the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus declare that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners across Spanish state territory to Guantánamo, as is shown by a telegram of the Ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid.
This reflects the documents forwarded by Wikileak's daily newspaper "El País" (by cables). It is added that the former deputy government secretary María Teresa Fernández de la Vega asked that the Spanish government should be informed, "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft that flies Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, where aid for human rights practices was charged in a dozen countries, including Spain, Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega, former North American ambassador.
The Deputy Government Secretary admitted that the Council's report "has taken Zapatero off" and reaffirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objection to the secret service flights across the Spanish state area."
"You just want to be informed," not to be "unpreparedly surprised," reports Aguirre by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed to the ambassador that the Spanish government "will not pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, as they lie in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente González, on the other hand, gave the message in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to declassify the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Defense Minister on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no burdensome or sensitive information," said the ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "clear coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to manage discreetly between governments," complains Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, where the US Ambassador and Spanish Minister of Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were insanely considering their independence and doing what they consider appropriate", he instructed his employees to "concern rebellious comments in order to let the tension flee away."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the practice of the PP in this matter.
"Through their overall pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the government of Zapatero would have tolerated or deliberately ignored actions in the US that could be considered as possible violations of human rights, even if these revealings could have negative effects on the US government," he stresses.
The child murderer admits that she complained on the Internet about the "drill" of maternity.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galician manner"
Monthica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she leads from small, she keeps contact with a kiss and at least one girlfriend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The notifications are from 2008.
To understand these, you need to know their love life, reconstructing the ABC daily newspaper on the basis of witness statements from their family members.
In 1998, the 30-year-old galician woman opened a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
She held a year.
Shortly after she had resolved her relationship, she became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his former never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Soon she entered a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to take care of the labour market, the young man stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But the contents of their news can be concluded that their love relationship broke and separated them.
In March 2008, she is on Menorca alone and writes: "Alberto is very strange and sad because I came to work."
"When I told him that, he found it good, but now, of course, he noticed what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to do and to let what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send the boy to you."
She complains, "If he doesn't like I leave the boy with my mother, I'll get him off when I'm back."
In May she talks about returning to her village: "This week I go there, but I will only stay there until 19, because I have to imagine a work on the 20th day if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she's taking her firstborn if everything's okay.
"He will be with the one he must be, that is, with me. Never in life I will leave him again with someone except with my mother," a doubtful intention when considering their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand he's with me and the place likes him a little, but on the other hand he must go to school every day."
She speaks of a move to Mallorca.
"Then he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenses for the baby girl."
On 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant cushion of César who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. If he wants to, he finds me such a shit."
On the 30th again, "The boy's fine. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, their current partner, there is one: "He's shooting me money."
On the Internet, in anime and mangague logs, there are communications from her.
She even had a own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison offensor."
"Terror a la gallega (transscription)".
The last man who lived with her, a prosecuted hunting overseer, explains having conscience bits because he feels guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Momagica was transferred to the Province Prison of Palma by the Centre for Judge Prisoners yesterday.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the expiry of the matter, "and she did not have the intention of adding damage to the little one."
However, beforewards, she had been able to drown César in the bathtub and stain his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutorship requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats at the Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
According to the important votes and honourable Members in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking forward to the parliamentary elections, or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party has reached in these elections is usually twice as high as the number of votes in the elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 61,473 votes at the parliamentary elections of 2008, while this number was only 316,222 at regional elections in 2006.
On last Sunday, the PPC achieved 384.091 votes.
If this ascending trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's vote and the electorality of the PP's electorate - should stop, the analytics of the PP predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congress Members, while CiU also gains four (here now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (from 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - currently having three - while ICV could hold its Members or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections in May 2011. Also then the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to end the socialist domination in four province capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will be able to lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists do not reach a majority or take back to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican Debakel, it is not desirable that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona municipal council, in which it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP increased its vote in the four capitals of the province and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's revolt. There they had ruled together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
And Lérida lies the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels, or Reus, the People's Party was able to record a significant increase.
At present, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell worried thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanians and the Nigerians arrested by the police of Barcelona's secret service formed the chiahadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "moving to liberation from Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was author of the attacks in Bombay, which requested 106 dead in 2008.
The Spanish Minister of Interior confesses these investigations to a great extent that he assures that the "Operation Campai" has been "weakened" and "so their ability to act" by Al Qaidas worldwide.
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy was composed Al Qaida, so that their "fighters" could unfairly exceed the borders of European and other Western countries.
The covered cell is not the only one of the Shihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, apart from the Thai investigators, other European police units have also contributed to research. It is not excluded that in the EU's area it will come to similar attacks in the next few days as it was carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanian Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) was carried out in Thailand another in which the Pakistan Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai countries Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok from the cell settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - particularly tourists stole passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the name of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
In research circles, it is underlined that no connections between those arrested in Catalonia and the Attendance in Bombay were found, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the beneficiaries of the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be reminded that a few days before the Attendance of Catalonia, several thousand dollars were sent from a cash transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of Prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", which put an end to the life of 106 people.
The police have confiscated a comprehensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The Chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to present Artur Mas personally its conditions for supporting his presidency as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. They do not differ from those already presented during the election struggle and can be summarized with the priority of the economic recovery and the abandonment of regionalist independence advisors, such as a financial balance agreement that the regionalist leader intends to propose at the summit of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 Members who had won her last Sunday - a point that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable. For the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is required that at least one of the opposition parties will contain the vote at the time of the vote on his office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter at the forthcoming parliamentary elections at the Congress depend on a potential entrepreneur with the PP. However, the conversations that Mas is currently conducting with the other party chiefs are about Catalonia.
As regards the PPC's president, it calls for "all discourse relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia", as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque country - and that is to be subjected to a referendum to the Chief of CiU party.
Both political leaders are in common that they want to make the built-up political device of the regional administration slender and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the accession of Mas are addressed by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) who announced a hard opposition and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Altenpflegeheim confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Old Home in Olot do not exclude that their nurse killed over eleven older people
The Responsibles of the Old Caritat House in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference, in which they revealed the damage of the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurser who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - to the institution.
Joan Sala, head of the Old Care Home, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the deaths), but "law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only take a loss of social status because it did not detect the criminal acts of the careper in time, but now also pay a high compensation amount calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family.
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime goes back in August 2009 and that he has been further murdered since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old care home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally studied the deceased, but the formalities due to their ages and diseases have been handled by telephone.
The director of La Caritat nominated this point and said that "remaining measures could never have been the reason for the incidents."
The attorney of La Caritat added that "there were no indications of a person other than the accused person in the dispute."
The "Death Angel" was already baptized last 11 murders and explained that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and one and a half months later the second old lady killed.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of different calm agents.
The director of La Caritat explained that the personnel's access to the medications should be difficult to control.
The insulin syringe and the calm cocktail used the nurser in six of nine committed crimes to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will be shown whether Vila lies and actually chose for his first victims a less cruel death or whether he burned them out from inside by administering them bleachlauge, as he had done, according to the consent of three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the nursing statements of the nursing person, even as to the number of murders which might be more likely to be. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it does not make sense to change his course of action after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say that they made them available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents of justice.
Threatenings of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The euro-Peripheri countries' risks have increased dramatically, and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive and that the euro has hardly put on points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquide market, which is recovered in the measure in which it recovers again, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to revert our liquidity measures, which the ECB must make a withdrawal for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several times in the future.
The Federal Bank requested the termination of the plan for the purchase of State debt, as they are ineffective, as well as the withdrawal of all exceptionally temporary liquidity measures. It should be retained only one week's unlimited access.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be "at least until March" and to maintain the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that the program will continue to buy bonds and deliver a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets will be thrown back from yesterday and if we are being harshly persuaded to withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB session in May, where the Bank reiterated not to consider the purchase of State debt documents and the markets thereafter collapsed, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed the teeth, and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot, with which she provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one year's titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government accounted for only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basic points in the entire curve and thus reflected a perception change in the markets according to the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million short-term and possible further 15 000. There is time until February to obtain private capital or these banks are stated.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it did not recognise the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday the government has to receive Parliament's consent to its new budget, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is also a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has designed its discourse with regard to the summit of Heads of State and Government moderate on December 14th. There is political unity required to show that we play the same partition together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth Symphony Beethovens.
The Spanish Prime Minister yesterday presented the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, degradation of state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and employment measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange added by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was quickly and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year national bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we put on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our debtability.
For Spain, the application of an aid plan would be self-offering.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has EUR 40 billion available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed in time.
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with the Motto Caesar's wife: "Now not only counts being, but also the shine."
Just courage, we're gonna do that!
The chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen, at the request of his children, contends with the Confederation of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the Eulen companies and El Enebro, does not flourish.
David Álvarez, founder of the company group, will challenge the company meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on 16th, as he considers it "absolutely void". His children will try to receive a majority to control the administrative organs of the company - the owner of the vineyard of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute for the control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not seem to be willing to give up the control of El Enebro's institutions in his dispute.
He was dismissed from the Administrative Board by five of his seven children, appointed to members of the Administrative Council at the Shareholder Meeting of 18 January this year, which has already been registered in the Trade Register.
The social meeting of El Enebro, which was held by the Judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, triggered a new thunderfall in the family Álvarez.
The appeal of the Judge to the Congregation is the only legal way to ensure the establishment of the Society Meeting.
The last strategy by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "despaired means of the applicant - his five children - to recognize the unanimous assembly by means of legal insights, fraudulent acts and abuse of law," as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for fighting the congregation afterwards in order to explain it as "absolutely void".
In June, the same protagonists, who humbled in discreet silence, have already tried to invoke a congregation on a judicial basis.
At El Enebro - the property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use over 51% of capital.
This is the actual background of the case that the judge has to decide in the hearing on the treatment of the contested complaint for which no date has been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this read universe is characterized by the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one gave attention to the newling and despite his steady ascending course during the last season, all of them were set on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso in November.
Without describing the powers of the German pilot and world master Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "home weapon", which the Multi Siemens Red Bull had in hand, and thus created a winner team, became legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software to simulate processes that brought the German company to the market for purposes that do not have to do with authors.
This PLM computer program was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and highly precision instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid errors and overflow costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and the most famous utility vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected on the race and in the tests.
Russwurm claims that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked in the race stables, which were able to introduce at least three or four improvements in one season.
In Red Bull's team, 180 highly qualified young people are busy today. With powerful EDV systems, they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all the components of Red Bull's race car, except the engine for which Renault is exclusively responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality by means of advanced production plants and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that can spend a formula 1 team for its race separation in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his race cars in a 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true formula 1 - Held is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the Energy Drink manufacturer puts in the services of its participation in the race tracks, further protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their knowledge is zero.
The technologian head of the work, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago, it was possible to say that the progress in the R&E sector contributed to the victory of 50 percent and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the shares have changed. The technology represents 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unforeseen gladiators".
HP will open 20 own stores with local operators in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) hosted his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first one of 20 stores with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in the multimarket business, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
As an example, the Deputy Chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, called the rebuilt shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has worked with it for thirty years.
The North American group intends to set up 200 sales offices in Europe by 2010, of which 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbien). Barcelona is the third business.
Mrera did not want to betray the upcoming new openings, but did not exclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The Deputy Chairman, who is also Head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening the shop is always the same. They support a local operator with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises this and takes over the exclusive loading equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the shoppersonal.
Helena Herrero said it wasn't a franchising system and pointed out that the exclusive sales office network is intended to "optimize customer service and consulting small and small businesses when shopping and then, even the packaging."
The Barcelona Store has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way we can solve problems that sometimes take up to two days in ten minutes."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and small businesses and private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million customers 'claude'
The Managing Director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but at first a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
However, it provides for a breakdown of the interest rates that banks are trying to compensate with increases in fees and loans.
Sabadell expects to catch a million private customers in three years - an existing subject.
Sabadell has found the way to spend the next three years, thus surviving in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year Guideline in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using public aid from the FROB but also to increase the market share by a million private customers - 700 000 if you deduct the customers that will lose the bank - and this is the great challenge that this bank faces, because it has so far dedicated more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers represent more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, experitivity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will present it together with the annual financial report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish goals in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has resolved all the plans of the banks worldwide.
This year, Sabadell will conclude its four-year-old optima guideline, which was initially designed to be three years, but as a result of the market situation, he was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings boxes are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that in 2011 a "stricky" year would be "with great range".
The manager assumes that Spain was only "slow" from the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years - basically for the survival of banks.
Even if it assumes that the war for liabilities - which punishs the interest margins - will run, the risks that banks and savings will have to pay for their liquidity emissions will already be deducted from the price for loans as compensation for decreasing profit margins.
"The topics of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on credits."
"We haven't rotated the hahn, but the interest differences are very high," confessed Guardiola.
Banesto already issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the grant of long-term loans and increase interest differences (see Cinco Días, 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the state, "to increase the fees," but "inside a competitive framework".
Sabadell's guiding plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporative businesses.
Not for nothing he assures that "larger companies are necessary in Spain."
"The next year everything will change," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "energerately increasing" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will become abrutschen in red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market in capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he awakens the argument of some bankers who already prophesie a new liquidity crisis.
It stresses that nothing could be circulated, but, unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing can be achieved through repo operations and thus the crisis can be eliminated.
CECA excludes a second merger wave of spare boxes
The CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a merger wave of the sparkassen and emphasized the speed with which the industry was restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish sparkassen began, several sparkassen did not participate in the first phase, and they prevailed the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassen Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The involvement of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, rather it was adaptations."
"The largest part is finished. It may be that we have 13 or 14 instead of seventies, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organized by the association of managers and managers of Aragonien (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process was "as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limited expiry, which was set in earlier times, not now, under the business plans with Banco de España," he emphasized.
"The transition of 45 savingsbuses with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a historically uncomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he highlighted.
Olavarrieta said, "there would have been a number of unsuccessful opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed insaneness and insaneness, because "Banco de España urges us to conclude in due time before the end of the year."
The CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems of Europe and "probably" throughout the world and added that those who doubted that they did this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy, we must "no concern" us about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have been through a "very important" concentration process that "as soon as possible".
He also reminded that the Spanish banks were very well involved in the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro but at the same time set up conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and small enterprises, regulating time-working companies or repealing the 426 euro support for unemployed unemployed to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Government Shepherd, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as a responsible person who has sworn out the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It should be presumed that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the euro.
Germany takes a fundamental new perspective for the design of our future, which contradicts the maintaining of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany begins to speculate over three possible pathways from the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south had to leave the euro area.
The second: The re-establishment of the German Mark - although at present it sounds more like Science Fiction - supported by a large number of public opinions, about 50 percent of the population.
The third parties: a reconstruction of the euro in accordance with German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budget management; punishment of the countries that transpose the requirements; possiblely, the adjustment of payments to some countries and the expansion of the cost of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been characterised for some time. That is why there are no excitements now.
First, 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission made incentives for deficits and the German government moved a constitutional reform from the sleeve to prevent this from in 2016.
This was the first sign of the disagreement between what Germany considered necessary (strong tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country, when Merkel drew painfully out the decision to rescue Greece.
At that time it was strongly criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and public opinion were absolutely opposed to Greece's rescue.
Finally, Merkel is new in the last October days with a clear position and calls for a reform of the European Union agreements to enable a country to rescue and at the same time oblige private lenders to carry some of the costs.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European as it pushed the Ireland crisis and all of the following.
But their proposal, even if something has been sweetened, has been adopted, and in the next few months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed.
It all says that, even if unpopular measures are to be taken, there will no longer be the old functioning of the euro from this date.
In 2013, the year of birth will be a new monetary area in which the conflicting countries will be severely punished, forced to explain incapacity of payment and in this case the private sector must take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, consumption diminishing, productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and buildings with huge holes in the balance of payments, as stated by Spain in tree times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not only about dropping the State deficit down to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope the current turbulences are going to be more quiet.
And that we will use the possibilities that are offered to us until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero did so, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) pointed out that despite the criticism of Merkel, to create the hypothesis of order in their own house, it has made its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like it would change something.
Among the possibilities considered, it is that we must not exclude the euro area that has been fully stacked with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulation
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to deal with a sanction.
According to the two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League, a lot of ink was forgotten about whether it was an importial act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (their team had already won clearly) time and played several fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed sanction in the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter into the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of the UEFA punished the trainer of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often to be found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules but followed in this sport -.
Part of the upcoming debate on the presented case is that a team of the Real Madrid football club (which presents nobleness and honor in his hymne and punished his players for similar incidents on other occasions) played the main role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added a episode more to his long history than theatral and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behaviour, which is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts represent a rule.
In this case, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical ignorance of the counterplayers, a aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the counterparty players from taking an unjustified advantage from the counterteam. Nor did this happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under wrong play or rule, because the turning of the rule has not been done secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as noticeable as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited down and welcomed the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the infringees have drawn from the deliberate fouls.
Here it should be stressed that the rival was not brought into a more unfavourable situation or benefits for the played game were heated, because the obvious result of this action was that your own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It's also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club won't have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, up to a certain degree unaware advantage, as the team could sometime separate. Furthermore, the players receive a sanction with this approach and pass into the second card cycle in which they separate from a card less than in the first cycle because of card collection.
This does not make it clear whether it really is an advantage.
Finally, such practices do not oppose the sports spirit, including strategic decisions, in order to benefit the most from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to deal with sanction (this would actually be a clear case of regularization), they wanted to choose when they were undergoing it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding a penalty or fleeing from her.
Although the limit between invention and regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that polemics have been created as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of provoked rule transfer.
The damage that was added to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offer Offensive for the customer's catch for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar leaves this year a plane of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread out. They don't want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are again group dinners in the past night, which lead to Barcelona's restaurants and leisure industry. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they resolve a prize-offensive to capture the customer segment that represents the large mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, the respondent entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
In order to make the bookkeeping even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls to one Friday) has dropped all orders in the week of 13 December, with the result of a plane of reservations from dinner on two peak days (the 16th and 17.) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when bad times began, many companies have set up group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to miss this tradition, many employees pay them out of their own bag.
As the economy is, lowest prices are required, the Chairman of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs, confirms.
The representative of the roof association does not dare to predict how the holidays will look this month.
"The people think it's thirty times before they reserve."
"They would like to go out, but they are very careful about the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "provide quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and calls us to remember that customers are saving in crisis times, so prices are most demanded by 25 euros.
In a survey in various central restaurants, it is found that the evening of December 17 will lead the providers to the collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be treed. The group has adapted its menus with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, who has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the personality of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We made the impossibility possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
With AN Grup, the El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, the optimism is not lost after the revenues are bloomed again and good, though concentrated on a few days for the Christmas business.
Sources of the group highlight that 18th will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than price heat. It has the impression that customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and wish more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you can see green sprays, so the employees will be invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are back in the upturn.
The Deputy Chairman, Enric Gomà, is familiar with the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "lived", although the customers are "shooting out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebration did not go back, no matter who pays.
The Pakistan nuclear program excites great concern in the USA
Islamabad makes nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Explorations of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department was revealed by Wikileak’s webportal, which is the enormous concern of the Pakistan nuclear program Washington.
On the edge of the clearing and juicy details, which provide the documents on the content of the conversations and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between both countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened, but is "decreasing", and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistan nuclear program - that the weapons are not compiled, but their single parts are stored in order to make it difficult to devastate at a possible attack - Washington prepares sleepless nights.
The ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones, says: "The proximity of some nuclear plants to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumed distribution of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transportation of nuclear material".
The large number of people implied in the Nuclearsenale and the Raketen Programmes is not only seen by the US but also by Russia as a cause of caution.
"Pakistan has to set up strictly faithful personnel to monitor nuclear installations; because of the low level of education and culture, extremist organisations have more possibilities to reconstruct people who work on nuclear or missile programs," said Expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a discussion with his North American colleagues.
New documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the USA and Pakistan fails in terms of nuclear dissemination and the increased rate in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", explains: "There is no transparency at home; we do not receive any answers or they are refused."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as soon as no other country."
Embassy Patterson asks Washington during a visit to the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clear the person responsible," that "Pakistant army has its silent support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the antiterrorism struggle to prevent new uncoverments.
Interpol gives a red warning about the persecution and invention of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the content of things can be easily clarified.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" for the "finding and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
Moreover, it is not new, it comes from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the last release of more than four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian must put in Sweden.
The lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, also assures the police, "when and how she could contact Mr. Assange."
The international police authority, based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden, already issued the order, but it was not announced by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after receipt of the power.
So the things are. The 188 interpol countries are required to identify and find assange "to arrest and deliver it provisionally."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States, according to the organization, consider the red warning as a free letter for a arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to stay.
Assange's lawyers, who published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the departure from Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor who received the corresponding approval with the Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Security Chief of Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," the letter accuses.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia regretted the innocence of her son - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday he gave the head of Time per Skype magazine an interview from an indefinite place. He asked for the resignation of the US State Secretary, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats to pioneer the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the US, it would have to withdraw," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation as "spoken and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should pay attention to the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the CNN broadcaster.
Obama himself has commissioned a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new documents.
The attempt by the spokesman of the president Barack Obama to give less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim in these days.
The Congress Deputy Peter King, who will lead the Presidency in the National Security Committee of the House, asked the State Department to examine the possibility of setting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "to confiscate their funds and to follow any person who supports them or contributes."
Tom Flanagan, consultant of Canadian president Stephen Harper, had continued and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "mordled".
"Obama had to turn him into a target disc and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was, who sent through information in the government, he is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not executed is too mild punishment," he explained to the sender Fox.
Puigcercós searches with an eyedrink to the Carod Near Peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party to vote secretly on his continued existence in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general meeting principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to evade the thirtyth time of an internal intrusion in the rows of the ERC without direction after the loss of 11 Members and half of the voters.
The president of the party is aware that his resignation threat is not sufficient to the closest of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weak as its mentor itself and will not give him the same head breaks as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a eyedrinker, which would secure its position to the next local elections.
For the first time yesterday, it was clear that more than 200 regional members of the ERC could express themselves secretly about their survival in the office.
With ballots, not with lifted hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss the president a penal code, they could do so without fear of repressals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of splitting and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he reiterated that he would feel not confirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added, without specifying percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod Nearly calls for more than just the party to make his office available. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the top organ of the conventions.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority for the creation of retirement, they will agree with the Executive Board to an action plan from now to May.
They expect to participate in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the management will be presented to the Council on 18 May.
It is your intention to curse for Puigcercós. In return, this is supposed to promise to present the convention in autumn 2011, which the party's tip already considers a fact.
The chairman of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" damages stability and strives one for every time to enable the organization to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, which was signed by the acting Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog, is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that the Puigcercós is an ideologist, the holder of Innovació believed it was a fact that the party president was supported "in exchange against different objectives".
He counted five of them, two of whom are in the foreground.
Firstly, the "restructure" of the board so that this represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is the involvement of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally give up the general meeting principle as a functioning way.
He thus fights a reform of the statutes that enables the conventions to be held with chosen delegates.
From the terminating of the full assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which already fought for this at the last two conventions, is as possessed.
In fact, at the tremendous meeting of 2008, the party leadership was commissioned to review the general meeting principle at a convention to deal with the reformation of the statutes.
This date is still out of place, since information about the internal rest of recent years was not advisable to this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the laur, the time could have come to resume this matter and complete it forever.

China maintains its objectives to reduce greenhouse gases
China's representative at the COP16 stated that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of that country on the COP16.
During his first public appearance at the 16th World Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei, his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and transform its industry.
He argued that in the last four years, his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity creation, institutional development and support of pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing the emissions of gases.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China the authorities of the Federal States had cooperated with those of the Central State and the municipalities to achieve the energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he argued that some several years of plans have already been launched or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those who received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy that has been introduced in the last five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and from private hands.
It also runs a provincial project for climate change, another for the exchange of traditional bulbs through energy savings and another for weakening and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, scientific government consultant on climate change in this country, confirmed that the efforts of China would be far greater than generally accepted.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tons per person, while 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a total of nine percent contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it makes unprecedented progress in the field of energetic use. Energy effectiveness has been increased by 20 percent over the last five years and is to be done by 2020, he said.
Legal Exclusion Espinos: César Navajo
The national leader of the PAN said that the former panist party president had the right to contact the National Order Commission and to ask what the right would be to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento had been right and that the former party president of the PAN had the right to contact the National Order Commission and to ask for what the right would be to him.
In an interview that took place before the complaint management of Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he explained that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision made at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to contact the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said that it was not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance to the presidential candidates had never been at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened from the internal vote on the next 4th and 5th December, where his successor was chosen.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a subject that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a presuppose for the election of the municipality, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he explained.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "does not scare us the internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and strengthen it," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman, which Acción Nacional needed for the next three years, and therefore he gave the staves "to those who would determine the Council."
"I am very uncared and open there. I would be proud to transfer to each of the five the office of the party president."
He predicted that the party's last elections of July 4 will reflect in the next elections, although "it is not time to think of 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which came from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would carry the flags and observe them throughout the country. Therefore "many hopes and visions are put into them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of the requirements."
When he was asked about the criticism of PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in the context of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI to think about the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than Fox and Calderón's, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the cabinet," he reiterated.
He believes that the holder of the federal government could make expressions like those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because there was no oral ban and even less a censorship in that country.
Obama is engaged in Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and press on the adoption of this law," the President of the United States twittered in the popular social network.
Today President Barack Obama supported national mobilisation to support the Dream Act - Law for the legalization of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and press on the adoption of this law," said Obama.
Its brief release contains a cyberlink on a wider document that calls for the public to contact their senators, as the voting of the law goes ahead.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all voices for each law, except the extension of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators could affect the vote of the Dream Act - Law and other projects such as ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Regarding the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that once the tax theme was solved, a schedule could be set up for the other projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matters must be dealt with before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on it at any time and then we can plan the expiry of the rest," he said.
The Chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday, "he would ask for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - Act, with which the initiative for the legalisation of undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from the next Thursday, although the next week would be more probable.
The version of the Dream Act - law or the law of the American dream would legalize about 800 000 young people who moved to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old during the last five years in that country and have been registered in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the defenders of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, so they are dependent on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At the moment, the organisations of the predecessors of this project organise an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said that he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act have to get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to return to the initiative.
Among the most evolved Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans, who backed up the Dream Act in the past, are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they did not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken for the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the representative house has a different version, the analytics agree that the Dream Act in the Senate faces the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Delight on the Language' was a walk in which the participants made strong for the narrative
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who had to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used the subtitles of her question at this occasion (on another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "Please bring us in trouble," the Argentine scribe sweetly approached the audience, which was mainly composed of young people who came together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round of table moderated by Marisol Shultz, at Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she devoted to Gonzalo Celorio, and then marked the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist who is looking for to learn what a "wund" is, and from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not answer but receives instructions for the guides of her story.
She is convinced to leave the infectologist, "Geduld is not my strength, maybe that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who robbed her on the middle of the passage, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalytic reveals the secret: "The wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the narrative sucks eases and concludes that "from the wound only learned that it is really open and not existing". But it is convinced that the desire in the language and their cases is mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented an enthusiastic narrative that he called "Lob of Invention", and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
With presentations to magical realism, he tells about a famous magician who touched the clouds, brought back far-driving men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turn of turning and reported by America, the great novel, which was not missing from the beginning on his own chronists, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the flood of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), spotted the premature witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with impression that even the shame came away."
However, he emphasizes, "is it the crazy and liars who imagine things best," and where reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side is the story, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls that the 'tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the row, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations to which the FIl's invitation to the round table 'The finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cubans and Puertorians devoted their contribution to the great wound of social violence that their country falls - as well as Latin America - as the result of the fights for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not deliberately planned engagement," she explained after she had highlighted that literature is communication and liability that builds up between the author and the readers as with a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "this fingers of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-lived world, the intellectual habits and control of consciousness will go beyond dogmatism, and will forget, "that behind every confirmation is a small no and behind every dismissal a small yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuance: And nuances often meant to put the finger into the wound and to harass those who feel much more well when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also to harass the mighty ones who prefer to share the world in black and white, he invited to recognize the sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the Duell between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game there are also two different styles in relation to their respective trainers, and their encounter marked by counterparts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept good, so this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentine has played up with the Medaille to the second champion, he has remained a step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played together with the same team.
The Santistic Stratege reached the first final game as a trainer at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the tendency in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the crucial duell, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torreo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put a retrospect again, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went unequivocally after 210 minutes, but at the elephant metre he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to insert his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rivalry. Therefore he does not want to be persecuted again by the calamity and freed himself from the evil magician to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that for him the most important is the game itself.
"I want to become champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection I give myself, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before, is the most important," the taxman commented when he was asked about the lost end games.
The last final game has remained strongly in memory, he assured that he learned a lot from it: "The only teaching we can draw from it is that until the arbitrary judge doesn't puff the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared with two elephers, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no occasion for celebration."
To know that this series could be decided by elephant shooting, he doesn't worry because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the elephant shooting, you want to finish in the regular playtime, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes because of nervousity or the intense desire to keep the title in our hands, that left us something for this end game, and we hope that this time it will not come."
It is in Romanso power to be not only the second champion and for the first time to cost the glory that the titles bring.
The US changes the rules for the receipt of a visa
The persons must present themselves before their discussion at the consulate at the service offices for visa applications; the costs will be reduced in such a way.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for application of a visa are altered in the message of the United States and consumers.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves in the Consulate before their discussion at the Visa Application Offices (ASC, initial letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the consulate before the discussion.
The new procedure has certain benefits for aspirants, including:
The total costs for the processing of the visa are lower, as it is no longer necessary to pay the date agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service to which the document is handled separately.
The applicant shall provide only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterpart to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visa with application (including visa for time workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to have a conversation in the consulate, they must only present themselves at the nearest ASC where they submit their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second date for the consulate, remain less time there than before.
Those who request the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo do not have to pay the service surcharge of 26 dollars anymore.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the Fund of Foreign Earthly Life
The North American Space Agency called on a press conference to present tomorrow a finding that will have impact on the search for living in all.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States announced tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of existence of alien life.
The Fund is presented at a press conference at NASA's seat in Washington by experts of astrobiology tomorrow at 13.00 p.m. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was launched, the NASA assured that it would introduce a "conceptive find for the search for extraterrestrial life" which caused speculations among experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it could exist in hostile environments that have been believed to be inexistent, humanlike creatures. The hypothesis was raised that they could transform into intelligent life - as human beings - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently it is a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in a environment that has been considered to be too toxic to all possible forms of life, as the lake is strongly arsenic.
In any way, the microbie uses the arsen as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proved that "it actually gives a different form of life, a second form of life that differs from the one known to us."
On Thursday, the Space Agency announces the actual scope of its fund at the press conference.
At the conference, Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturns) in question whether its chemical composition is similar to that of the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
The reform of the organ law on the Congress introduces the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislature period had just begun, and a block of opposition was already installed, led by the MEPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who represented himself as an independent.The four questioned: the entry of the 'Two Party System' into the Chamber.
Before the beginning of the opening session in the 60th Legislative Period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez von Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the organ law, as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties who controlled the convention.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau of the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Deputy Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties had introduced PRI and PAN institutionally their political margin with these reforms.
He argued that in the next days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, and they went out of their political will and if they did not, they would be disjusted by both parties, with which the opposition coalition would end.
"Bis here I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decision-making which do not even consider taking into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were consents with PRD, PT and Patrón and that a pluralist group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that after the convention was monopolitical, it should be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that a eternal two-party system should rule in the Congress."
"For the beginning, this group starts with five Members and they talk to other colleagues, so that they may become more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT led to a presentation on PAN and PRI that the Congress was currently transforming into a 'beute' for two.
"Before it was only one party, now they split them up to second."
Patrón Montalvo requested to respect the Members and to assign them their place to the negotiating tables.
"The five, which are likely to be nine Members, must not be left outside because of top decisions, but the five who are currently viewed as divided into different groups, have decided to unite in order to take our place on the negotiating table, because because of the reform carried out and agreed by the others, we are left outside and we are not agreeing with this reform."
200 000 more peso for "the supplier"
Mazatlán's city administration pays a further check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check over a little more than 200 000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
The sum paid to the owner of the electrical material company in the second half of the year amounts to 1 200 000 Pesos.
According to the site for more transparency of the city administration, this check issued on a amount of 200.144.56 Peso with 9258447 last November with the purpose of "Accounting Open Accounts".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already forwarded that more money would go from the community to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it is sold at higher prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total that is still due to it and the number of cheques that are still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"It wasn't purchased with her, it's just paid the debt, just as with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "dow up" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as is required by law when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to prevent other administrations from applying their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be reused.
After the Noroeste newspaper had published the examination of the checks issued by the City Administration to its suppliers on July 25th, it was known that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010 during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million Pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where they entered cheques in the value of over 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists as a result of the bad condition of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the collapse of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested to pay special attention to the authorities, to the areas in a bad state and to throw a bad picture to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Zona Dorada trade union, reminded us that there were various opportunities to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find to new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and roadways would have had a negative effect, as tourists came to shame and saw the injustice, whereby they would turn the back to the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they would not perform the construction work slowly and planlessly in this way."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist would have noticed the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance work from the city.
"The community must take over its responsibility and avoid this happening again. How to do so? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in the afterlife," he explained.
"We are desiring to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we also have a right to have a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to preserve the city in a good state."
"There are other places that also look uncared and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It must be offered a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps tourist attractions constantly in shots," he added.
"These provisions have not been given enough attention and this kind of incidents expose what is obvious for all: a maintenance is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán because they would not be properly used and caused a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places to be brought along with the city to frontman. To make the city clean, decent and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Happy Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that first need to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive for tourism and to introduce them to the inventory with which we are recruiting for this destination.
IP calls for results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that the Members should take over the great responsibility of giving an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The company industry of Mazatlán demands a worthy Parliament, free of talks between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 PRI MEPs, 13 PANs, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRDs, one of PTs, one of Convergencia and one of PVEMs.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to make a clean work, to feel obliged to society and to the different social groups dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partyity and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the Marketing Coordination Council CCE, suggested that the new Members should take over the great responsibility to give a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members really exercise their right to act freely of agreement between the parties, because it is common that they make agreements with which they represent their own interests, with which they transform themselves into carnival complexes of the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We are concerned that they are carrying out a trusted work and engaged in all things for society and their groups, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Hotel Association Tres Islas, believes that one of the major challenges facing 40 representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because the economic situation is extremely complicated today.
"The most important thing is that they promote economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote the creation of jobs."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to grant the necessary positions in the state budget to the Ministry of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the second few, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchanges and investments into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Tourism projects must be allocated to funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been reaffirmed in previous legislature periods, must be updated.
Searching for Holy King
Puppen, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family hungry.
For parents, the next three kings day, it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes, because the household is no longer and not less than 12 people and a goat jacket.
Even so, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar give them the toys and the garments that they so call.
The family inhabits a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from their hand in their mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Some times are hard because my husband has no job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... I've been going with the gowns to sell the streets in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wishes a barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has been trying to have a 'monster car' for some time, and for his eight-month old brother Jesús, Cayetana presents clothes in size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I would like this monster,' but I answered him, 'Let us wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sad.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaias has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A couple of 5 1/2 or 6 sizes would be very helpful.
If you want to help to achieve the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Heiliger König will be searched' by spending a toys or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspicious drug dealer arrested
On Wednesday, a production and sale network of cannabis was broken down by the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people were arrested and will be charged with different charges.
The house searches played in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, where the predominantly drug production should have served.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of Haschish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the Security Police of Quebec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, from which two of the men who are considered to be the main dragon of the drug ring came from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons should have appeared for hours after their arrest before the judicial building in Sherbrooke.
They could, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis, whose possessions for sale purposes, the competitors and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a long-term investigation that took place for over a year.
"The information received from public hand has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel stated.
About 70 police officers of the regional investigation unit Estrien of the Security Police of Quebec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Office had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be persecuted without problems
The draft law of the conservatives, which, according to the government, is to regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be maintained for all prospects after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I'm reluctant to this charter."
"I'm holding with a party that has put your feet on your feet," said Michael Ignavif, Chief of the Liberals, after the expiry of the weekly Caucus session before the assembled Members.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law allowing any person to be held by a ship that is identified as a means of transporting illegal immigrants for up to a year, violates the constitution of law and freedom proposed by Canada.
Gilles Duceppe, Chief of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the draft law, as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has proved the critics who demand that their party was not steadfast enough to the secret immigrants.
"The Neo Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and we are just trying to implement this by means of another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We do not therefore support the draft law of the conservatives because he is looking for the debt of refugees and keeping children caught for at least a year," Chow stated.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties to play with politics and ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians must inform the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of intellectual immigration, those criminal processes affecting Canada and treating the country as a footsteps."
"They expect Canada to take hard action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any confidence in its draft law which could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a conservative person has said to QMI's agency that the government would call for a vote so that each opposing Member would immediately explain to his electors.
The new unit does not find any unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the formation of a public research committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this topic last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has a standing unit against corruption.
Nevertheless, the Wednesday announcement has surprised more than one.
It must be said that, despite the presence of Robert Dutils, this measure was not least discussed at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Québécois Partie, this announcement in pointo public security qualified as "out of the hat burst rabbit" and "on a table end right-to-faced solution".
On the other hand, Minister Dutil had turned back to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the questioned future unity.
"They will see the result when we will declare it," he welcomed.
"You're aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest keeps in trying to prevent the formation of this research committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means to form an Investigative Committee is Jean Charest's resignation," Yves Boisvert, lecturer for ethics and policy systems at the ENA (State University for High Administrative Training).
In order to get out of this sackgasse, he proposes to Quebec that the financial auditing authority be given a special mandate so that it can provide adequate research through corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to expand the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the same power power as Commissioners, which would also allow you to commit people to say.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the leaflets of the government of Charest.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to alter the penal law in that way, to be better occupied with this kind of crime.
This demand comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of the Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier about the fact that the law is not clear in this type of criminal prosecution.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, on the other hand, confirmed his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, at the moment with certain novelties involved in this dossier.
During the Operation Printemps 2001, which involved the groups of motorcycle police, 131 persons were arrested, although the penal law had not been novelled.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterdom.
Rivers under strict monitoring
Several river runs continue to be under strict guard because of the high rainfall that has been erupted in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in Mauricie's administrative region, there was a landfall on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening, a further terrestrial rush occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A road has been collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfall has crashed from 40 to 70 million in several regions.
From 20 to 40 meters of precipitation were expected here by Thursday evening according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouai region were most affected.
There were a total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers.
Since these rainfalles are still to be counted on the snow melt that has already gathered in certain subareas, the crossing of several water runs is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service called warnings about the flood alarm on the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière are here to the property of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the severe rainfall has moved to cross some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a retirement bridge was progressed due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the violation of certain lakes caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains in alert and monitors the situation at least, according to the safety adviser Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Highwater Centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, especially by Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Duponted partially
For its controversial statements on social care and Haitians, as well as because of its decent speech on radio, the Quebec radio operator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial relapse before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR).
The CCNR argues that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their own opinion, but certain statements would have "unacceptable information on social care and unauthorized negative representations of the Haitians as well as such an unhappy speech that is not appropriate for the daily broadcasting."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which includes the spread of the names of two persons committed suicide, violates the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the period 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was filed as a result of a complaint from the "Front Commune des personnes assistées socials du Québec".
The activist organisation complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inadequate.
The moderators should give sound information rather than misleading.
With regard to the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont believed that suicide was an expression of vainness.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the transmitted message was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the relevant consequences of the Dupont le midi mission would have adapted a sensitive topic in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was occupied with no reproach against his person.
The last issue was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given themselves a media-effective dispute that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI engineer had explained not to have donated for the benefit of the Haiti aid, as one did not surely know whether the needy would actually receive the donations of money.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments have not been misused, but that their cumulative effect presents an unauthorized negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already paid off my three-day suspension penalty in this matter."
"My file has been young for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board calls for the dissemination of an unhealthy expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcasters acted "beyond their obligations".
The consequences for the radio station, which should have been reported once and for example during the main end time within a period of three days, are small.
A King of the Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has launched a very special course.
The athlet, brilliant in "Sanda" (Vollkontakt Kung-Fu), in the Kickboxen and in the Thai boxes, is now rising in the search for new challenges to Tatami and to the world's box rings.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with fighting sports such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxen," said Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight of all places, because for those who do not like the ground struggle, as the mixed battle art present him, they are rar in North America."
Recently, his sign as a security officer and the company UPS employed his rivals gave bad news, in which he ranked two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the world championship of the amateurs between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I achieved the victory in the categories of Kickboxen and the Thai boxen," he explained.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup in the San Shou in China."
"There were those fighters invited from every category that had been placed among the first four at the last World Championship."
"I'm kidding in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"2005 I became in Vietnam Back."
"2007 I ended the tournament in China at the fifth place, while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, where foist strikes and footsteps are allowed as well as soil roots.
The two fights usually play on a platform, more rarely in a box ring.
The most renowned box fighter, which has emerged from this type of fighting sport, is the American Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, which is probably known in the world of battle art.
If Nacer had to retain Zemmal only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super-Turnier "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most ranked in China," said the sympathic pound ceremony.
"It's a bit like the equivalent to the stadium of Lumpinee (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
In the midfinale of his category (80kg) six times had won his first fight before he lost in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals meet each in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the king of the Kung-Fu."
450 million in contracts without invitation to tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant 450 million dollars of contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert water force project.
A consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which have received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a total of 295 million dollars without tendering.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a accompanied by the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to deliver this important hydroelectric project to a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" increased the lucrative contract without having been a public invitation to tender.
For the Québécois party, the withdrawal of corporate consortia represents a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of competition and a price increase.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and awakens the competition."
"This means that instead of taking a carded game in a secret way now in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, MEP of the PQ, yesterday at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how public interest can be used in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by claiming that this contract would have been a carded game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she warned by strengthening that the PQ was "unreasonable" and "missing her hard."
She said it was "the minimum," that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to bundle their expertise in terms of a command to tender for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project shows a high level of complexity in terms of its workout.
The construction process is in progress and is supposed to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without a competition struggle; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec even in relatively simple projects no longer constitutes an exception.
According to the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of construction engineering and consultancy is subject to government communications.
A short flying of the Quebec corporate register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozens of them, leads back to the same legal person, namely to Dessau.
As far as the consortium "Énergie gérance" is concerned, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of many James is subject to special labour force dynamics and that hydro-Québec has taken special account of this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nose has made the fact that the contract on project management was approved after agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only few candidates, your prices will be faster."
"You have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this Mart and say to you, a satisfactory agreement will be negotiated at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is crucial, but the knowledge of the people," reaffirmed Laporte.
This contract authorised to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received by the part Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consultant contracts, which were approved between 2002 and March 2010 by companies or their branches, including resources laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin had acquired 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking part in "Energie gérance".
All of these contracts have been negotiated.
They totalled $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had announced that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that they "financed" before clarifying that it was rather about their leaders.
Barometer - The "green" label is not trusting
Green but uncircumcised skeptics.
The Quebec Consument has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but it is equally little about the brands marked or the eco markings to control its choice.
Shame, although it bathes in a media-effective universe, where it is only so diminishing from information in favour of a more responsible consumer: the barometer of responsible consumption has to complain a lack of credible information, an inadequacy which makes itself known as a brake of his engagement, as the first reading showed that was held yesterday.
Although they have driven the consumption of so-called socially tolerant products in 2010, the Quebecians still seem to have little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admit, in fact, to give little faith to the company's environmental engagement as well as to the green business advertising, the measured instrument elaborated by the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthiness of official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which declare themselves environmentally, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important for the stimulation of this consumer segment, which is currently being experienced by almost one third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, empty and doubtful nature of information fought the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of the Quebecians is dissuasive about the performance of the green products and services that are being made available to them.
According to another communication, over half of consumers had changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their convictions.
According to Barometer, they also prefered 61% of purchases in their district dealers and favored the purchase of foods built in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumption of Quebec loves to present itself as king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by caring for animal protection.
However, social and ecological consciousness seems to stop in front of its car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecians have indicated, used public transport in 2010, or preferred the transport centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The admission and bicycle riding were also supported by 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavior survey, which provides the Clinical ideas.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agreed with cooperation but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to redirect it to his actual cineastic function, does not seem to receive what they requested.
Although the government has accepted to engage in this matter, it is under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a lower bond than the initial hoped amount, which could bring into existence a viable solution to beneficial conditions, at least according to the sources of the public germs.
A first action plan as well as an application for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the bitt request has been corrected since the again summarily downward.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement of the entreprise culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is headed by the eXcentris Act.
Several days ago, he had given her a final report.
However, the counter proposal of the cabinet was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time to respond to them by 31 December.
In any case, the premises of the State donation seem to have really been pushed to the side.
Let us remember that the Quebec ownership community of the cinema and cinema complexe had resigned against a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by giving the argument that the Minister of Culture has no financial assistance for real estate projects there which he did not have other cinemas.
However, several other market participants of the segment complained substantially and economically.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had presented the authorenkino in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception of the State Casse.
The lack of cinemas, which show independent films, is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the stage.
The Société Angus as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top of, turn on a privately financed campaign, from which they hope a sum of $700,000 to curb the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirer is to reopen the three cinemas on February 27 next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des Dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not called off the newspaper "Le Devoir", and it is ignored what he and his group think of the proposals that have been corrected downwards.
Mystery of the complexly shaked Canada ventilated
The new American diplomatic lines, spread by WikiLeaks, ventilated the secret of what the United Nations considers under the minority complex of the Canadians to the Americans, but with the same stroke they open the superiority to Canada.
Thus, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voter does not have the Canadian-American relations in mind, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to implement their 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more pikant details than the mere material content to which one has to knife.
A connection dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal election campaign was held in full run, reports on which point the United Nations no longer participated in the interventions discussed by its political chiefs.
For the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador used in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A Canadian almost indigenous complex of inferiority may cause the Canadian, political leaders much more to talk about internal issues of everyday life than to push the United States to the black Peter (as in 1988 during the campaign on free trade),” he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, are therefore "the pronounced Goliat of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him".
The ambassador understands this "orbitant silence", as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assessed, "it must be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party chief to conduct such an essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in mind during the course of the election."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the communication sent by Terry Breese, businessmen in Ottawa on January 22, 2009, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the continued existence of the government in the federal budget at the beginning of February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade due to an effort programme of 30 to 40 billion dollars," explains Breese.
He had never mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent Parliament from being crashed from coalition and to affect the quality of the proposed programme of opposition.
Another communication, dating from January 2008 and written by the Ambassador Wilkins, understands Washington from the ever-neglecting picture that the dramatic series of CBC spread from the United States.
The ambassador is worried about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where you can observe little subtle games to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also deductions for the purposes of CIA's muscle prots.
Another communication explains in detail how Hillary Clinten asked her French colleagues Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual case decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he sent out to the state secretary a paper in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the act again."
Finally, let's note that the minds are heated with regard to WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely standing consultant, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "turned".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for renewal of lighting
The UN yesterday in Cancun proposed a plan for renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly a third of the additional reduction needed to be achieved to stabilize the Earth climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction obligations in the industrial countries.
According to the plan yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of FCKWs issued on earth due to lighting, if the white glowing bulbs, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better (LED).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fluorescent park.
Last year, in Copenhagen, the large gas emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should cut the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, this balance sheet would still have to be deducted from 5 gt to stabilize climate rise by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 to prevent it from being controlled.
In the white glowing pears 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact luminous bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy needs can be reduced by twice.
The compact luminous bulbs keep between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those who have marketed Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white glowing birne, which gives an impact on the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that the entirely novel bulbs donate very little heat, they can also function with a regular resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves, as they contain mercury and that they must be disposed of as a special waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except the producers provide an acceptance site.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact fuel birne, but rather the coal power plants that emit much more mercury in order to generate the electricity distorted by the white glowing pears.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury each year.
The report presents the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars annually when purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion Indonesia.
Ivory Coast Expects excitedly the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the "unfair" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Elfenbey Coast immediately after their expiry of time.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent election commission to receive their work and to disclose the provisional results without further delay," said a press speaker of the UN Chief.
"He asks all the parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove their responsibility and to include each initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exercised by certain foreign governments, the Election Commission had expired the Deadline, which was set at midnight on Wednesday, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "go on work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have become loud, the CEI may finally call the name of the winner of the second round of election under the Laurent Gbagbo and its opposing alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo-Lager, however, expects to cancel "be fraudulent" voting fees in the north through the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces Nouvelles (FN) during the failure of the coupon in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign of the Elfenbey Coast, had confirmed that the FN practiced manoeuvre to intimidate the electors in the north of the country had abandoned the president's followers to choose.
The whole choice could be canceled if the complaints submitted by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparts are now more of the opinion that the highest court of the country is not neutral, as it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely connected Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north who disagreed with the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in proclaiming the results of elections as "unreasonable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to demand the victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results, as he knows that he has lost; and submit a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election commission has been prevented to publish the results, being illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the association and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts over years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the politicians of the Ivory Coast that they could be held responsible for them in the event of possible outbreaks.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable 9.3% (including overseas departments at 9.7%) within the meaning of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, according to the provisional, seasonally adjusted information published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee.
The number of unemployed in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The data of the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In detail, 3.4 million employees of the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wished to find a job, including whether they were employable every two weeks or not or whether they were job-seeking or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the young people between 15 and 24 years were unemployed according to the IAA.
On the other hand, the elderly have a slightly increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of over 50-year people, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1% over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion on its calculation procedures, the Statistical Federal Office of Insee has no longer published monthly unemployment numbers since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union's Statistical Office, continues in this method and announced a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) on Tuesday, compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the Board of Directors of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), a investigation procedure was initiated and he was sent to the prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of a investigation procedure on the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of a disruption of societies, contraception of general goods, healing, medication in corruption, unauthorized bribery and arms ownership, so his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to express himself on all questions that the prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading brain spins."
"It is easy to submit to him a number of criminal offences, another thing is to prove it," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Press) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialist) in the department, had been interested in giving the judge a memorial for his justification before he heard his lawyer.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than keeping his deposit he had to lead.
As regards the business area of competence or the destination of the associated fund, he would never have known, said Simon.
In this Affaire, Daniel Pinna, former director-General of the Public Service of Aubagne Balling Area, was also accused of interruption and compatibility on Wednesday, but then relocated under the opposition to keep away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client could give explanations to the facts that were accused of him."
"The executive prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and were released from the prison in the night from Tuesday on Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, said the Deputy Supreme Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is legally pursued by "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, which, due to the title "Reporting and Constructing of General Goods by a Public Service Officer", the other on the basis of "Mediteracy in Constructing Public Money".
The lifemate of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "the healing and undermining of society's powers".
Among the people who were confronted with Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned because of a similar Affaire of fraudulent acts from public hand that affected Corsica.
The fans suspected his society to contribute to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X is carried out in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letter in the acts of several open investigation procedures in respect of alleged fraud in public contracts, particularly in the field of disposal.
According to close research sources, the investigation focuses particularly on the conditions of surcharge and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the area of Aubagne, as well as to certain cities of Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde rice: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its middle function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran for spionage, held the French public in breath, placed diplomacy in an alert and accented the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
This is all under the attention of the diplomatics of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and presented by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some backgrounds to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to Americans, which went to give these advice to deal with their own crisis of hostages in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French controllers tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and by American justice because of trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making them the idea credible, the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of clotiled rice, in a grilled light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostages".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategy issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method.
They advised Americans to put everything in order to return their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
"May noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without submission" the words "Ground Human Rights", "innocence", "continuous release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which respects his image very sensitive.
"Take this all the more, since the Iranians ask you not to do that."
Because "standless sweaters don't solve anything," passing the discussions on unintentional ways, the Iranians are "Meisters in Revenge Manövern".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common, Iranian tactic" for political expression.
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (which was supposed to come on August 16th, on the day when she flee to the French message) "reach the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euro deposit).
And he makes it clear that Elysée anticipates further hostages, a phenomenon that will "acclude itself".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotiled rice was released 12 days ago, but is still held in Iran.
An information was introduced: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition demands the United States for illegal trade with sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from prison after a judge decided in Paris.
The American message, like many other observers, poses questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France purchased a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
Due to a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "comprehensively surprised by the judge's decision," but also attempted to reject it.
"There has been a rainy exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "strengthen" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée advisor selects a telephone number, sets up again, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "are currently located in the buildings guided by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the preservation of Clotilde Reis in Iran, the Elysée does not save his efforts to believe by means of announcements and by the media organized "flight attempts", the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A Telegram dating from 25 August 2009 calls on "the media flash of the French authorities".
On the basis of the "Thankful Conviction" to Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy wonders.
"From their statements full of praise, the French authorities confess secretly that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then addresses the reasons why the Elysée has made it fall.
He analyses the intense communication efforts "to confirm Sarkozy's open-up policy towards Syria".
A policy launched in 2008, which was then "of many criticisms in France and abroad as premature and unworthy".
"The Syrian role builds up" is trying to lead Paris "Syria in mind what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sown twist between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from good source.
On August 11th, François Richier had trusted her: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians did whatever".
"But we thanked them, despite everything."
"This should at least cause confusion with the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the elysée.
In a communiqué he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countryman".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Aschenbrödel", which will forbid young people to play online games after midnight by sparing them access, so government responsible.
A draft law to call on the online game operators to refuse access to these games for young people under 16 years after midnight, will be presented to Parliament in December, painted representatives of cult and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with learning in school and also with living a normal life throughout the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this draft of the law of the French press agency Agence France Press.
The online games are again available from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The producer companies would have been able to prepare for the application of the law for a year, so he clarified.
The government also considers to ask the manufacturers to cut down the time limit daily for access to these games to the young people whose parents ask for it, the controller added.
He will also provide free programs for those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events connected with intensive Internet usage.
The country is also inappropriate championship in global online game competitions.
In November South Korea had won four gold medals in World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: the FIFA appoints the institution
In a bright excitement due to the suspicion of corruption, the Executive Committee of the FIFA amends the educators of the World Championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which the ranking for influence and lobbying threaten to impose the technical criteria in the background.
One thing, however, is certain: the 2018 edition of the FIFA's Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional high-bourg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes to continue to win new territories (Catar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the measure of the economic and political use of a World Championship.
So the machinations behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to create a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) file offer more arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, with the launch of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the releases, could also have ruined the chances for their own country, Wiege of the Football, which only once allowed the World Championship, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC again gave the nutritional floor by radiating a documentary report, which took three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to angry the FIFA and embarrass the English responsible people who, primarily with David Cameron, had an intense lobbying in these last weeks.
The head of the government is hoping for a new edition of the chess train succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intense effort be sufficient to re-evaluate the image of England in front of the committee?
Nothing is less safe, because the Duo Spain-Portugal does not lack trumpets with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shades of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible repressals against the English as well as the doubts about the Solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (Stadien, Hotels, Transport).
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to plead the unfamiliar protest on the notices of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of votes" by the committee members.
"You throw them with dirt, you're trying to compromise them," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, headquarters of FIFA sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages compared to Japan and South Korea, which separately set up a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidates seem to be premature for two countries who had participated in the competition in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA's hot-looking approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which causes Asian opportunities to fall down to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all registers with the expectation of futuristic stages, the FIFA pursues its extension to new areas, but these two countries represent a greater risk, for certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (on the basis of time shifts), the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
Second mandate: openness
The Gaulle had really been screwed.
In the middle of the border, he had believed he'd punch.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least hesitant.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next one.
The current Head of State will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But openness is not good at the side of the mystery that holds the presidential function.
So you have to do as if the doubt stands fortan.
In the one way, as well as in the other sense.
In 2006, the adherents Jacques Chiracs claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without having to believe in it.
On November 15, Nicolas assured Sarkozy in serious tone to make his decision "in the autumn of 2011".
That on Tuesday evening in Elysée, before the UMP parliamentarians, he would let the perspective of "two mandates" sound, so it had spread a little feverity.
Was that the official announcement of his candidateship?
Far missed.
The President merely reminded that the constitutional change in 2008 limits the number of five-year terms of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous sound.
"You have only seven and a half years with me, or best," he explained in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about the phase after that."
His words from yesterday do not make him a candidate more than the previous day, but also no less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidature with the PS on one side.
But it is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy is striving to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidate in 2012, which reminds many members of the PS early than accepted for the fighting year.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the electors of the right would prefer a candidate of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," responded immediately and carefully the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he would be a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin informed.
"He will always believe in being able to victory," corrects Alain Juppé, who has found himself open.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its purchasing of State documents
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should offer opportunities to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy to be concluded at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European State debt obliges the Central Bank in Frankfurt to not afford to do so, even today's more than anxious situation in the European bond markets in order not to bring about their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, welcomed yesterday at a press conference the active role taken by the ECB in the solution of Europe's government debt.
It has not dared to say whether it was the opinion that the Central Bank could do more, for example by raising its programme of purchasing national bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, had not been very speaking about his projects, but was rather pleased to point out that the programme of purchasing State Papers on the secondary market would be "developed" and that we will be "seeing the decisions taken by the Assembly on Thursday".
Only certainty: The ECB will override its direct interest at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the Treasury were doubled from the ECB to approximately EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And according to indiscretions of some dealers, she should have done new purchases on Irish and Portuguese state documents yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There is no doubt among the dealers that the anti-disciplinary of the purchasing price will continue to be followed (see page 29).
People's farmers are not expecting a remarkable change in courses.
If the bond transactions of over three months will already have disappeared from the ECB's Arsenal, the latter will create themselves in a free manner at the full reserves of funds, over a period of one week to three months.
The farmers are already endeavoring that this measure will continue to extend for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
"In any case, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, Volkswirt of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," in his opinion, Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their interventions on the State debt market, "the ECB has to maintain such a volume of purchases in bonds that are experiencing the borrowing market," adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the exponent position of European banks on the markets of national debt in the euro area, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must be on the market at any price to the deputy investors and act in such a way as to prevent the premature enthusiasm of the yields paid to the weakest countries," said a major bond holder yesterday.
Because if the interest rates are to be fixed, the countries would be more restricted to reduce their debt or to stabilise them.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi government is going to cover in Italy
After an alarming weekly beginning for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the decline in the quarterly interest rate to 10 years.
A return to deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional chairman Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indispensable" and had expected to hear it with an "unpredictable" weekend, but the person immediately demented.
In any event, on Tuesday, the Schere with the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy increased to 263 points, which caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy on German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "heartedly worried" of the "market turbulences" and a potential risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at the Hudson Institute.
It is clear that its problem is the absenteement of economic growth and the resulting, susceptible tax revenue that threatens the State to no longer cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected... although the budget available in the Senate for examining is expected to be 1.3% or 2%.
Under these conditions, according to the EU Commission, the budget deficit will be 4.3% of GDP next year (other than 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (not 2.7%).
Therefore, the retirement of a new budget collective which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new savings will need to be taken," says economic auditor Olli Rehn.
At the hour, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The main firms of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have already repeated for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund, responsible for the IMF with Italy.
"In the moment there are no problems, neither in the short-term nor in the long-term perspective, since Italy demands less stabilisation progress than other countries, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. D. R.),” observes Pier Carlo Padoan, CEO's head-consultant of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be faced with a request for suspicion from the Chamber of Members, as a result of which the elections to be held could already be organized at the end of March.
It is therefore a little favourable period for a decision making on a severe crisis.
Europeans think about the development of anticrisis measures
Christine Lagarde had highlighted it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think you have proved it on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: the Europeans are clearly together, ready and committed to defend their currency and their monetary area".
Although completely relative - yesterday's deduction in the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to speak of a beginning of normalisation.
The Rating Agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt note, probably the most effective target of speculants today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, particularly in banking systems," said the people's farmers of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially, "the political time is going much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of this gap as well as the danger that is hidden in them, intensify the discussions on strengthening the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the most directly concerned financial ministers and, in a further sense, with their counterparts of the G20 go well.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroups and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the plan, the loss of non-conventional measures to strengthen the euro area countries in the crossing of the markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, its executive director Klaus Regling has already started its Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapour to inform the investors in the Far East about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit Fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain.
The first advertising paper expenditure on the EU Stability Fund is planned for the next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters Agency had trusted, the United States supported a possible increase in the mobilised fund by the additional, direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are sending themselves to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisations.
However, reforms aimed at showing impacts in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are different from Greece and Ireland.
Both the one and the other are at any price to avoid the need to ask for international assistance before setting up their own budget corrections and choosing inadequate structural reforms that permanently bring back trust to them.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of the markets of state bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on passing through Paris on 24 November, had first raised the idea that if the EUR 750 mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be enough, the Union would not hesitate to resume its own bag.
Barclay's Capital's peoples, with regard to the market of European government debt, judges that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, preferably, in the form of a direct liquidity syringe.
This appropriation exists: the European mechanism of dominated financial stabilisation, which is currently EUR 60 billion.

Snow and Glatteis: 24 Departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow episodes are still taking into account traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of the Bretagne and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alarm level Orange due to the threatening snow and glatteis risks.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in alarm level in Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers tangle the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it sneezes easily on et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow coverings are expected from 2 to 5 cm, instead also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is striking enough to cause traffic disabilities and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are blocked for heavy transport of over 7.5 tonnes, including the transport axis Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The transport situation of the secondary transport networks in the Bretagne is very difficult, according to the traffic police who dispose of using their own vehicle only in the emergency, and the use of some TER rice buses has been deleted throughout the day.
In the Picardie, school traffic was lifted for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "demands the drivers to the highest caution on the streets as well as to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked the airlines to delete 25% of its flights from Roissy Airport and 10% of Orly flights due to the expected snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in southern London as well as the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are locked up until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: First financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport sector in the Ile-de-France has been in full run, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, we recall the 23 billion for Metro Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead to the start of construction of the SGP, the State has launched a capital dot of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to give a part of the financial sum to its twofold in the markets.
Today it has finally come to the first high-level figures.
The 2010 supplementary budget, through the National Assembly Financial Commission, sets out the measures for the first part of these funds.
This is two measures: the creation of a special tax for the establishment and higher taxation of offices in the Ile-de France.
First, according to Article 15 of the draft law, "for the benefit of the public-legislative Société du Grand Paris".
This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
Secondly, it is a reorganization of the existing company taxation: "To modernise it to increase the product resulting from it and to rely on this increase in Société du Grand Paris".
How much would this bring in?
A mystery.
This sum is not counted in the text.
You are far away from the 4 billion.
"It is stated that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital dotation that are put up by the State and that the Société du Grand Paris is gradually made for the project," the explanation is to be found.
The SGP does not find this system anxious at all.
"Since the moment when you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projection for three years and then only create from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is notified in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four promised billions will be able to look for for a long time, is a risk of creating a quite moving parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rachsüchtig hacker and emsige spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double significance.
On one side, she has pupped out as a obvious scandal, a scandal that is just a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy, which rules the relationships between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a prepayment to the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead of the row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that any file created by a secret service (a x-like nation) consists exclusively of newspaper cuts.
The "external", American revealings about the sexual habits of Berlusconis do nothing more than what one had to read in every x-loving journal for months (except those whose owners are Berlusconi), and the alarmingly caricatured profile Gaddafis offered cabaret artists for their chess for a long time.
The rule, after which the secret dossiers may only consist of already known news, is essential for the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will recognize that every work (via the Gral, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzlers) is repeated exactly what was already written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish any research (but that is why he did not know where news about the non-existing would be found), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Just like the secret acts.
The informant is faul, and faul (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (other than he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy had sent to the State Decree in Rome, were the same as those who had published Newsweek the week before.
So why was such a lifting to reveal these dossiers?
On one side, these people say what each educated person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of World War II and since then the Heads of Government can call each other or take a plane to meet at dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have transformed themselves into spionage centres, with the exception of some small representation tasks.
Every spectator of investigating films knows this very accurately, and it does not happen from hypocrisy that one does so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is publicly repeated violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-popular hacker can tackle the most secrets of the most powerful country in the world is the strike against the prestige of the State Decree.
In addition, the scandal brings the victims less than the "crackers" in distress.
But we devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once, at Orwell's times, all power could be bundled like a Big Brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have been shown as perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction, the visited hotel, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizens would become a total victim of the eye of power.
But if you notice what is going on today, that even the secret cripples of power can no longer escape from the control of a hacker, the control stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as a robber of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
How, though, can a power that is no longer able to preserve their own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real mystery is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free of secretism, since it gives the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this distress that has been added to such a mighty power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will not make any reserved information more online - that would be similar to a hanging on the streets.
But it is also obvious that it is forgotten with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports about telephone secret.
Nothing is easier to find out if and when a Head of State moved away in a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
In the future, how could private and only for certain ears be spoken of certain relationships?
I know very well that at the moment my prediction sounds to science fiction and romance, but I see me needed to imagine the government agents, in secret manner moving on uncontrollable march routes, to hide their communications nowhere but in mere memory, and also the few written information they have received in the shoe set.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, the spying test of Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer today, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionated communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephonic) wire.
The (analogians) video cassettes had allowed the film researchers to explore a film band for tape by splashing from the back to the front and ventilating all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs today are not able to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
With the high speed trains you drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while it takes three and a half hours by plane including the climb.
It is therefore not exceptional that policy and communication technology come back on car and horse.
A last observation.
In past times, the press tried to understand what secrets were smed between the messages.
It is now the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the rapidly dissolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or early financings), which have been implemented by the developing countries.
And already the rough French beautifuls have been uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have undertaken to provide 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million a year).
Due to the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn all registers to convince its partners of the fact that they are committed to fast-start financing: detailed action report of its Member States, press conference, large side events, brochure distribution.
The operation is noteworthy and decisive for its actual value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see it if all the developed countries did the same at the same precision level.
The EU announces that in 2010 the EU has released EUR 2.2 billion, which will lead to the right way to respect for its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional use has been introduced, without being disadvantaged by public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what means "new and additional".
While the EU Commission proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guide value that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has been a target for those in 2009: international financing will be maintained and will be 150 million in the framework of the Financing "Fast-Start" for three years.
Other countries have chosen similar targets, either as regards year or as regards conditions at public development aid level.
In return, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no targets in the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
It is clear that the total French support for developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France suggests to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another key element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule about this, and everyone selects its accounting mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 borrowed € as equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is only difficult to represent: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments ( often linked to the emission end-up) projects based on the most effective technology, it is fraudulent to present the euro, which is taken as equivalent to a donated euro... Furthermore, only the costs of the loan for the investor country should be charged as an commitment (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by recording 91.5% of loans (€389.8 million) and spending EUR 8.5%) 36.1 million (see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that largely uses loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (e.g.) meet their commitments to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the majority of the European Union spends 1€ for the fulfilment of its obligations, France just gives 10 cents and understands similar use.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: partly with further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial use.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promise and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (which seems to have been Bercy who has carried out the Arbitrage) could result in a double negative effect; once EU internal (why do the other Member States continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of early financing is just a small question for a relatively short time compared to the overall discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much the drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope this will not be the case.
In any case, it is indispensable to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its type of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equation of justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward discussions on the disputes of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently discussed subject): the question of "reasonability" or the type of accounting of its loans is not addressed.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as to the disputes as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "reachability" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes over the day 81 different chemicals, a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of generations coming).
The association, which explains that their results "represented not a statistically significant value in the light of the small number of analysed samples, but represent an illustration character of the treated problem" between July and September, the usually purchased within four, from a approximately ten-year-old child to the meal-consumed food plus an interim meal time in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been investigated as well as wetries of laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemicals, including 42 considered potentially or likely cancer-increasing and five classified as safely carciogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine distortion factor, according to studies of several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if in the nearing total of cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, this survey is very well taken, however, that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancerous substances or substances with endocrine disruption factor is anxious," notes the association.
Even at breakfast, the butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially cancerous residues and three safely proved to be carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as a interim meal for the study, shows traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study identified traces of insecticides strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hack steak, the tuna from the bush, even the Baguette and the gum of pesticides and other chemicals were spitted.
In the water of the lead, analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was at the "richest" and even the plastic cellar used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The ultimate risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for consumers "is probably under-evaluated," said the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has, on its part, proposed "in the light of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "accention of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 residues of different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
