DFB-Chef Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the National Team.
"This is a question, of course, that depends on the fact that one gets to talk to him about why he seemed to feel this as it was laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmaher" of the "Bild-Zeitung".
Despite the monthly debate on the photos of Özil with the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had played more for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be so up to a certain time," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had explained his resignation from the DFB team in July and also founded that Grindel did not defend him against racist contradictions during the WM.
The DFB-Chef repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with federal trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from the soccer so that if you leave a team or change a association, you talk to his coach about it and I'm sorry that this conversation hasn't come up until now.
Linz: Garden House burned in Schreberg Village
At 14.13 p.m. Linz was alarmed for a fire in the Angerhofweg.
Because a high voltage line leads directly to the Schrebergartensied, danger was in motion.
The occupational firefighter came out and found the cabin in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be virtually removed to the barley and fire rubbles had to be cleared in the absolutely necessary size.
According to owners of the burning garden hut, he had mounted an battery to store at noon.
That might be the cause of fire.

The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined, as well as the cause of fire.
However, he should be considerably because the owner had many collectors in his garden house.

However, sometime the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan misses an ear fig.
Under tears, the actress adheres to how shocked it is - and she holds the cheek.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently totally unclear.

Audi: "Dieselgate" workout lasts longer than planned
"The Diesel Taskforce is still there," said the development board Peter Mertens, "Autowoche".
In December 2017, the Audi Chief Rupert Stadler announced that the task force was soon dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/driven combinations are expected to be tested," he said at that time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage goal in the process of the Dielkrise.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the Dieselkandal at the Audi-Mutter Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car builder has made "graving organizational changes" so that such scandal never again occurs.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler's future and wanted to continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities propose that the Audi Chief have approved the sale of diesel cars with false exit values after recognising the deception of the gas fraud.
He knew about manipulations or consciously ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot heads the company as Commissioner Chief.
Due to the conversion to the new standard of exhaust and consumption WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner voice".
As a result, he sees a falling demand for limousins such as the Audi Models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot is on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already present 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives to re-election - Lahm is supposed to be in the DFB presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the WM-Aus und Özil-Affäre, wants to reapprove the office as a DFB president in the coming year.
"I'm doing my work and I'm trying to do it as good as it is," said Grindel as a guest in the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" on the early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I'll do that.
And then you have to look at whether the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association finds it "notic" if he would not have "joy to cooperate in the future project" after the grant for the 2024 football.
Grindel has been Chief of Association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, crashed over the summer fair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for the first full term of three years.
The next vote will be adopted at the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM Chief Organisator Philipp Lahm is to cooperate in the DFB Presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that in this role he will also be advised in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, warmly invited to provide his experience with sports questions," said Grindel.
In speculations, whether Lahm could become his successor as a DFB chef, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence from the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that a national player without migration background will be an integrator of the DFB.
Currently, this office of the born Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without migration is clearly involved in society and football and says, "the topic is important, we have to take care of," this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the spot where integration needs to work," said Grindel.

In short, panic emerged, people ran through each other.
Seven observers were easily injured, the organizer Hugh Evans said.
The New York Police and the musician Chris Martin then calm down the people from the stage.
"Nobody's trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all in security.

Freedom of press: Federal Government defends the journalist's raid
Government speaker Steffen Seibert has defended the sword of a journalist from the press conference by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the office of office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had moved a T-shirt with the Turkish and German recording "Freedom for Journalists" and went to the first row.
The T-shirt, hadn't been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance of the expiry of the press conference.
The reporter's action has caused a strong disturbance, which is not acceptable.
That's why he caused human protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor Office.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying activities or support or membership in banned parties or fethullah wave movement.
The Turkish leadership makes the movement responsible for the failed coupling attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatening several decades of imprisonment.
Also foreign journalists are not safe in front of the Turkish authorities: The Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested until the beginning of September.
Recently, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had made attention.
Although they came free and could return to Germany, there are still processes against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-looking his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for moisture conversations at the Theke of the Hamburg Harbour Kneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller stirs with her guests on some beer, some wine or also more high-percentage beverages to lure the mood and tongues.
Not a few promis also drink courage for the mandatory vocals.
On Friday a further episode of the popular Talkshow was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Greatest Day".
The Münchner did not get the excursion to the high north at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely screwed on it, the eyes only two little slits.
The bed-selfie shows a completely lauded florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he has only a powerful cater.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now won: "Regel one: go NOT to Inas night.
Rule two: Do not drink the black sauce.
And spit.
And the round of egglicur, which ina melts around half three, let's go.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the retirement.
They ranged from instant breeches, fish breezes or - probably the most targeting - headache tablets.
Others were simply amazed by the view of the usually attractive cinema.
As Ina Müller has survived the night's collapse, it has not been known so far.
Since it has moderated the TV-spacing at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with Vandalism and Unrate
The entrance to the 36 kilometres long railroad in the Red Cageland in Treysa presents hardly found and blurred.
Recipes against grassful vandalism are being searched, but solutions hardly differ.
Shears, cigarette chickens, waste and unrat, demolated trash and now demonted signs - so since the length of the entrance with the seat group to the wheelway on the hate hook in Treysa has been presented.
For the showing object railroad in the red cageland, a more than awful sight.
The topic has been employed by members of the AFFC local group Schwalmstadt, but also by others, according to the cycling officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the cycling council.
There isn't a solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the settlement of the seat group to the regular disposal of the waste tanks and cleaning of the areas at the entrance site.
"I think the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Desertnhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been introduced to the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting point on weekends for celebration.
It is not only a lot of loudness, the layers are also destroyed: pistes breezed out of the earth, trash demolished, signs knicked, seating furniture smashed.
Volunteers had already been cleaning up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the pronounced drops on the hot stone.
They are angry that the Rastplatz on the Radweg in Treysa is a meeting point for Suplage.
"Belonging the entire cycling path, here at the Haaße-Hügel is clearly the focus," confirms the cycling officer, who now also cares for the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same destiny, it'll be very expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "The threshold may be significantly higher to understand common goods.
However, this would presume that a police strife will pass by time.
Basically, desertnhagen wishes to develop the hate-hocket.
It has to be more attractive.
The frequency of the cycling path so far could be very satisfied.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bicycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says the AFFC members.
As an extremely critical hazard station, ADFC member Susanne Klipper estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no abbie track on the hatching hooks.
In the case of rainy traffic, cyclists may have to wait on the street between both sides of transport," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music-Contest at the Cultural Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music competition was a success, creative and in co-operation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district-offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Competition for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A Contest "with eyedrinkers in the sympathic Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family community with coffee and cakes from the honorary officials of the Cultural Station.
Seven formations appeared, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long albatsmener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper star colors", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the children's garden Lummerland, and finally Rike Weßling and the Blackies.
This Contest, according to District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't experienced this in other parts of the city yet.
What were the texts related to?
At the places, the Hiltrup Lake and the market halls were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig shortened the mere in his sleeve-like song to the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Cultural Railway Station was also recognized.
It was always about the experience of fellowship in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke experienced the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the artists or indications on their creation.
That's how one learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitars.
Franke knew from the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed on Youtube in the meantime.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltrup gastronomy.
For the jury's favorites there was something special - so others can also hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: It's a very nice appearance with his Hiltrup camp, which particularly impressed Frank with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice appearance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children came to the final again - and even sounded "rightly good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, incorporation of the melody and recognising value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Economic Association, as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the District Office.
The district offensive had launched the event from the occasion of its ten - year existence.
She evaluated the event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the very full cultural station soon.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams sitting opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen screen, in it four cards with keywords that can be deciphered - the old trick with the red slide - only when you put it in.
Thus, it is ensured that the opposite side can not read anything from probability.
On the cards, for example, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd cubes.
4th festival.
These are the terms that it is now to encrypt.
For it is not to be advised here the terms, but codes.
Alternatively, a player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card on which might be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" it is to be advised, not the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: In this order and in this example, he should describe the terms "würfel", "Fest" and "Window" and so that his own team recognizes the correct order and does not make it possible to the opposing team; because that is why the game wins when he manages to knack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads loudly: "Whip" for the cubes, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; of course, here would also be something like "Party" possible and "Prag" because he has been watching in school and knowing the window tower there.
This is how it goes for round, team for teams.
Although you don't know the terms of the opposite, it can be better collapsed with any indication that the encryptioner gives there.
It may be mysterious, but not too rotated, so the revisions should be so, otherwise it is unnecessary to make it hard to his team.
The most cryptistic to "decrypto" is unfortunately the regulator.
The competitors probably have to study it quite long and extensively until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But the one who has once released will be fascinated with how much feeling is in this unlikely game.
Overall, however, "decrypto" is not as lussy as predecessor and Genre-Primus "codenames", which also stumbles an agent theme on a game less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever is just guessing and not about victory points, he can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and troubles guests in the Kneipe
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hitler Greeting in the Upper City of a passing police stroll, and later he also fell in the Upper City in a kneipe when he harassed other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized the place reference given by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In the nervous state, he must also be responsible for the use of signs of non-constitutional organizations.
Company Pressig was home to the shoe blocks
For decades, the railway station in Pressig was the turnslide in the Frankenwald.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffer kneeled on buffer, it was heard in all pressy," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't give up anybody.
Then the brakes also quieted and the cars knattered.
It was just railroad.
Pronunciative statements for Dinkel's homeland pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald, a place was so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep breeze to the north, which has its shining point in Steinbach on the forest after an increase of about 220 metres.
To deal with this, former train and shoe blocks were needed which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a train station with 21 locusts, teaching workshop, driving and railway championship.
"The heartpiece was the turning disc, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," explains Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historians and 47 years of career trainers.
The BW Pressig train station, which was underground in 1968, also operated locusts for the subways of Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Northhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported about a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electricization of the route 1939 has already minimised the need for train and shoe blocks.
From 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 weighs were ranked a month.
In 1982, parts of the company were canceled, 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not taken into account a better use of the site, even in the transport of goods."
Even on Pentecost 1989, the Railway Directorate Nuremberg celebrated the anniversary "50 Years of Electrication Nuremberg - Saalfeld" a pumping station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
It's a little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were deducted, the ranking station Pressig was history.
"The ranks and shoesmen made the most difficult work in training," recalls Dinkel.
Every mistreatment would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with uptake success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbleddon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.

A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened in the context of the series "Kunst und Genuss".
With great relief, organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the property was opened at the Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach, the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance".
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Rund um Walberla" in the series "Art and Genuss".
It opened its gates in the 15th year.
A great visitor's appeal showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as a major organizer and artist as well.
Something surprisingly, but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of the artists in the past and have participated in Flyer.
This year, too, there is a 70-cent special letter brand, available at every art station, which is designed by Art & Genuss.
There, too, this year's poster can be purchased for eight euros "betzn out", designed by Volker Hahn.
Hahn was pleased with the high support of the Special Exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler could be won from Nuremberg for the musical re-rahming.
When walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly becomes clear that the title "Windplay Performance" formally challenges artistic imagination and finally expresses it.
They are made of metal or ceramics, often equipped with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree spoon, brightened in color, playful with 20 wind wheels, 24 hips and 24 alu tubes as a sound piece.
With the lightning sun in the background through the bushes, the object acts mergely sunk and invites to stay.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, which is preferable in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years of K&G.
It's a lot of parts, in the wind in motion.
On half a route, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, people of Hahn show his colorful imagination of sound, cement, and stainless steel.
The theme "Windplay Performance" to slumber through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albanians: singers celebrate 50th birthday festively
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albanians also made their distress air at that time.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to find out partout that after the ceremony of the church chore "Cäcilia", there should be no more sanges in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they raised MGV 68 Albanians from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "house of encounter".
"It is full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep justice.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albanian singers.
They had renewed the foundation festival for the anniversary.
For years it was tradition, then there was only a break.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Traumschiff" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly talks about that the series could have had a co-debt in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of the Chiefhostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018 she went forever off board.
The series she left to star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason too.
Because I was grown up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world, and many of my admired colleagues perceived me at the height of the eye," Keller says in conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
At first, she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "Traumschiff".
Because now the journalists called only at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well."
She thinks it could have been that her husband could have been very afflicted at that time, but "as many men also shy Hans talks about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried to be the only right one for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed myself," as she further explains.
She always felt "not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared freaky and courageous at the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previous failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I feared that it could go wrong a second time."
On the day before the standing wedding I sat crying in the garderobe and wanted to refuse everything.
The marriage of Borsody also failed.
Why never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller's love at that time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not daily.
I've approached the love too naive."
The night fold, which regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ-Ressort Zurich, has been waged to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our feather is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the gorgeous shine in which a green carpet is dipped on the Six Lighting Square, fades it over charge.
But it's stopping film festival, there wants more or less famous in the light of light.
So on this late Thursday evening, he trembles over the place to make it easier in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
The public toilet facilities sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The need for the parterre of a new pavilion is a great effort to stream a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the Lord Oasis for some reasons to heaven.
So out here, over to the other streets side: Loaded guests who have just held in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" at the best level celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey warehouse each year.
That name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown are known from the entire earthball.
What do you need to do with an article about this festival to avoid falling into slice advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The feather binds a band around the feathers, which has put a good feather on him, and two bully doorstekers actually win him generously in.
Inside, the invited ones are dancing far to midnight to live music or can be suggested by DJ rhythms to which they call each other, and rinse with Cüpli exquisite chops down.
In the delicate dining shop in the souterrain, oysters are waiting for lubricating mouths, the incomparable raw shining Culatello di Ziblelo is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain sprinkles.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been so for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The falter studys the sign at the scroll staircase: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the scroll staircase."
If the two are separate instructions, he has acted in the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it has surely saved life.
In the household goods department in the upper floor, the poultry plucks a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not compelled by this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer is present.
And George Clooney, who has been throwing a brand for years, isn't here in the evening either.
But, between local prominence, cassen table and kitchen products, a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
That's why his main agent shouldn't be far.
And really: At the same time, Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty-sixts acting like a chorknabe, walks through the crowd.
He's not occupied, not acquainted, you're at the top.
Especially for this restraint, like misunderstanding, international stars love this film festival.

Only the initial phase "we've slept completely," the ASV trainer was angry.
The houselords quickly led with 8:1, even the early elimination that Bieletzki had taken, didn't fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a backdrop went through the team," Bieletzki summoned the second quarter hour together.
For the break, the residue was only two gates.
Especially Sending Bester, Marius Hintze, met in the phase for another time.
After the change it became even better from visitor view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst resembled at 15:15, then the seasonal changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the sirene, the proclamation was still apparently calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Put the impartial into the event.
Bieletzki usually guards from looking for debt in others.
But: The 120-second period penalty, which made Steffen Mühlhoff, was a joke.
LIT laughed well and met four more times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought greatly, also stood well against seven men and thrown on the empty gate again and again.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a fucking victory has to come," said the restlessly used Bieletzki.
ASV tour: hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), of the Pol (2).

Survey: 46 percent don't want Merkel until 2021 as Chancellor
After the crossings of the past weeks, the GroKo collects several depths of survey.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has brought the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD adds a counter to 17 percent, which SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only come to 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Federal Day election had been on Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes together, according to Emnid.

The government parties are constantly up to 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allenbach: 51 percent).
At the 2017 Bundestags election, they received 53.4 percent together.

The Greens reach votes from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the proportion of votes.
But the restraint for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also decreased significantly since the Federal Day election in 2017.
At present only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the office of office, as the Emnid survey issued on behalf of the BamS.
According to the survey, only every second (50 percent) wishes that the large coalition holds up to the next regular federal day election in three years, 41 percent are for a new choice.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, there were significant popularity losses for Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should again be a candidate for the CDU presidency in December.
47 percent, according to Emnid, are 44 percent.
In the case of Union adherents, 64 percent therefore wish to be a candidate, 35 percent do not.

Who says that in times of tin there are no more romantic curriculum history - it should be talking about poultry meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "Fastfood Datings" by Tiger and Co., the supermarket as a know-how location for the great love almost is an anachronistic romantic.

Wolbeck had significantly more play shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs in front of his outskirts (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the leadership.
Almost it would have been prevailed when the SCA in Minute 41 was the same two times in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer in the Wolbecker Box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his professional.
After the break, the VfL frequently took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes submission.
With the variation of Miles Geske, fetish on the left side again missed a fresh cell curve.

The folded person attacked himself and demonstrated his risk at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right sleeve hit at the bottom left from the sight of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes more that should be fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the criminal room unhappy.
Arbitrated Huseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed out.
Jannis Schneider was not allowed to escape the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske had a twelf metres in the 87th minute.
Could have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in business boards
Only 8 percent of the boards were female on September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday and the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to be different, otherwise the international competitors pass over them," said Stiftungs-Arbeitsführer Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male leaderships - with a few exceptions - have been no longer imaginable.
The resistance makes German competitors less versatile, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's another business culture.
The small increase in women's share among German stock exchange companies was also due only to positive impulses in the enterprises of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
However, according to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the past years, the women's share has been staggered.
Last, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure the Dax companies will recruit again consistent women in the next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have been signaling that they would not continue to commit themselves to increase the share of "null percent" until now.
Another picture comes from the Supervisory Boards: On September 1, the proportion of women was between 30,5 percent - 45 women and 68 males less than a year ago.
"As many women were recruited for the boards every year, a share of 40 percent would have been reached in 2023," says the report.

A note doctor car is severely damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passant has been killed in the collision of the operating vehicle with a taxi.
If emergency doctors are called, they're supposed to help - at best to save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end for a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in Bonn at the collision of a emergency doctor's car with a taxi.
The taxi driver, the notary and their drivers were severely injured as the police told.
The 46-year-old driver of the Notarzt car had crossed a red amp on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then met on a crossing with the taxi that went with green.
After the collision, the doctor car slipped against a ampling mast and a tree.
He captured the passant who died at the accident site.
The driver of the emergency doctor and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency doctor car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from operating forces.
The also severely injured 29-year-old notary could free himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another revoked emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured people were brought to hospitals.
The police determine in close liaison with the Bonner Prosecutorship who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we uncomfortable
After the blamable Aus in the Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU 1:3 is subject. The way of defeat is probably still to speak.
The scene in the 74th minute, where the regenerated Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back to the game.
As they suspected an offside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all the defense players of Manchester stayed, and Arnautovic read all the time in the world to pass the ball by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of a previous long distance of insufficient performance.
The situation is quite different at United's City Rivale Manchester City.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's large competitors, Pep Guardiola, against Brighton & Hove Albion, came to a 2.0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem broke Sterling for the home team for the first time through the defenses of the Aussenseniter.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former gatekeeper, made sure of the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the table tip.
Liverpool no longer table leaders
Three days after the 1:2 deposit in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Like the Cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoner.
The 27-year-old hit in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only match of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Better made it Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his slenzer.
So after the reds started the week with a flawless balance, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the Remis in the Liga, the Blues Liverpool also crashed from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London clubs celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (in addition to Watford) 2:0 victories.
However, the fans of the Gunners, with Granit Xhaka, had to wait against the surprise team from the Hertfordshire county until the 81th minute for a success report.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford Defendant Craig Cathcart unhappyly entered Alex Iwobi into his own gate, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil, with his third seasonal hit, made the decision.
Arsenal, due to the fifth victory, passed by Watford and is newly behind the great Rival Todtenham to Rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave uprising Wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained at 2:0 against Southampton in the Liga for the fifth time in succession and lay the 8th place.
VW brand missing: Paris automotive salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris car salon takes place every two years in the change with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic, but all-experienced: The Dieselkandal and the ringing of driving bans and rearrangements should not leave the German car corporations at the Paris industry meeting.
In the 2018 automotive salon, they show their novelties from the next week along with competition from around the world in the French capital.
The diesel actually doesn't play a big role anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the Government in Berlin, should be an important issue at least behind the shiny scenes of the trade fairs.
A great name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and include their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the ingol cities is supposed to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
However, both of them were officially presented.
The iNext of BMW should start until 2021.
The new 3er is at the heart of Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors arrived.
With the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Thousands are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injuries.
The island was shocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, there are enormous damages.
After the legs, the Tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach at a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims is still very high.
The figures have only come from Palu until now.
However, many other municipalities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
Some 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle passor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final goddess service for motorcycle drivers in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcycle riders on Sunday.
After all, the final goddess service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor passor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the secular concerns of the PS-star two-cycle drivers.
Between April and September, the last Sunday of one month of the traditional motorbike service (MoGo) takes place at the house of Nordhelle.
The bikers are traditionally celebrating the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, on Sunday, about 150 bikers were gathered in order to do anything other than ordinary worship.
At 10 a.m., the Boliden were rearranged before the entrance portal of the church.
First, the biker chopped up on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a delicious curry worst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were included.
The preaching held during the biker service of priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The Singer-Songwriter Valerie Lill took care of the musical undermaling.
"Although the bikers prefer the Blues-Rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic-calm sounds," said Pfarrer Frank Schröder.
This was certainly a Novum in the history of the motorcycle goddess service yesterday.
Furder home association celebrates great festival: After the apple the milk comes
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
A great interest also raised Georg Hartmann-Niemerg.
He had his apple press in the luggage and demonstrated his astonishing spectators step by step the process of the mature apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Numerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big thirst.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a fine cutting mass.
Not yet many of the children were able to imagine how this should once become a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important step of work on this late Friday afternoon.
In shapes packed and covered by networks, Georg Hartmann-Nemerg stacked the a little like hackselware-like apple pieces of layer for layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice went on and down into a large vessel.
However, the feuchtor farmer had already completed specialities.
So he opened his "shot box" and presented to the older visitors the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in feuchtorf" was accordingly great.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came to talk, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-in hupfburg for themselves.
Also active of the feuchtor comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the framework of the festival and invited some stations to short-term games.
The home association will also offer an action day in the next year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, will not be the home house in the heart of the Spargeldorf the place of events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the subject: finally it will go around milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with Fourth Season Pleite: "Beshissene Situation"
Frankfurt/Main Following the fourth federal liability, Trainer André Breitenreiiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hanover 96 for themselves and spoke courage to them.
However, many positives had not been seen at 1:4 (0:2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shameful situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football profi Pirmin Schwegler and said, "That's, of course, disappointing, because you're always taking a lot."
The further victoryless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86) joined, stands down with two meters and are a descending candidate in their current constitution.
On the other hand, Frankfurt celebrated the first season's home victory by the superb Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) achieved the gates for the DFB pokalsieger, who, after the successful general test for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome, took seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia's Vize World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessen and never to be handled by Hanover's defense.
The storms struck long after the WM showed with his pace and perseverance, why it is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, Brasilian Allan, who was borrowed by the FC Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurter, who started swinging.
One of Lucas Torró’s headballs, which was defeated on the gate network, first posed danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped at the last moment by the 96 defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (backs).
The leadership for the householders was almost compelling and deserving.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a defensive corner in the criminal room, Haller extended by head before the gate, where Ndicka only needed the foot.
It was the first Bundesligatre for the AJ Auxerre defense player in the summer.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time Haller fitted to his storm partner Rebic, who was able to drown through and made no chance of 96-Torwart Michael Esser.
In the mid-term, Hanover-Coach responded to the weak idea of his elephant and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxony played a little more courageous forward, inflammatory ideas remained until the end of the year, when the tracking trip still succeeded.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid cross on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only for the Frankfurter against the exaggerated guests, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes the partymeile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, good mood existed at the October festival in the city centre.
The Munich Oberbürgermeister Dieter Reiter managed it before millions of public at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two slogans.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christian celebrates Holy-Kreuz-Fest
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy-Creuz-Fest on September 14, or on Sunday afterwards.
The festival service takes place in the city church and then is a procession to the Holy-Creuz church with the final elevator.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year war and on whom the legend should have shot after a Swedish soldier.
From the wound, then blood flows.
This developed a large pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until today, just the altar room stands, the lack of long house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, priest Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the significance of the Geising parish, religious service was badly attended.
After the service, the procession took place to the Holy Cross Church and with the end of the conciliation, the church part of the Crusade ended.
For many years the Catholic church chor has then invited to the Catholic parish to the worldly part of the festival.
The choir members supplied visitors with hearty foods as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish community still offered tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to façade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will still move to the next year.
After the equipment has been set up for some time, the damage could be more accurately identified and the individual tenders are more concretely prepared.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already incurred a few years ago has increased, but it has also been found more, which was only possible by the inauguration by means of gear.
The socks are completed, before the winter are to be started with the natural stones, and we hope that we will be able to complete the half of these work this year.
Inauguration: New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Danube-Iller life aid opens a new home for disabled people in the Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" will be handed over to his destination - all presents agreed on the date of inauguration.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers, already living in the home of the life aid of Danube-Illers, have been dependent on the special architecture of the new construction.
Larger passages, hallways and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas has taken into account architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans started about eight years ago, when the former U.S. army officer building was placed on the test stand for the residents with mobile cap: "The house had come into the years and no longer timely in the equipment," said Bader retrospecting.
In 2016, the excavators touched to cut off the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life aid Danube-Iller opens new home
About 4.6 million euros invested life aid in the new construction.
The free state taxed EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to the architect Bader, the construction works remain in the planned framework - timely and financially.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Life Assistance, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagat between a barrier-free and simultaneously fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without any other help.
Similarly, the director of the social administration of the district Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents who need resources to be mobile."
The residentiality and functionality had been well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further, "The property in this situation is a real lucky case, because it is no longer in today's situation."
Overall, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße offers a space of almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities divided into three residential groups.
Stolz is life aid guide Heinz to the eleven full-time workers who are all employed by tariff.
Germany: Silently complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the Deputy SPD-Bounde President Manuela Schwesig called on all countrymen not to find themselves with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of unity.
We cannot satisfy these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on the "day level on Sunday".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer than the people in West Germany, but 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this malicious dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan-Jagdhund is supposed to shine the waves between the two of Korea.
In pursuit of a relaxation of relations with Seoul, Pjöngjang gave the South Korean president Moon Jae In two North Korean pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office reported on Sunday, the two of them reached their recipients about one year old on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the animals' "experience".
The dogs with the thick white fur, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural estate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The grant of friendship had announced to the north at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean captain Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pjöngjang.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and join in applying for the broadcasting of the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual approach Kim also agreed to close the To Bishkeg Ri test system for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
The 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months, has published numerous new books that mostly answer this question in return to the last hundred years.
In a different way, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-General of the Austrian State Archive, presents Austria in the magnificent "picture book", which will appear on October 1.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to Sacharbeit - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition that starts today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not finally conjure the "Return to Sacharbeit" mantra-like.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cassians and other active citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but it's about it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself to its mission - to government - then it should not be held with denominations.
Whether Union and SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and bubbles in recent weeks, may already show Monday.
In the evening, the summits of the government parties come together to the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to sweep conflicts early; a teaching from all the disputes.
Firstly, however, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with the Diesel renewals and the Professional Immigration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to leave the car companies with exchange premiums gently away, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to re-equippe older diesel.
During the weekend of this crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned professional immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for refused asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "spure change" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be again disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equally and equally with GroKo, but three partners with partly very different societies and priorities.
Arguing is good.
Without a dispute, a society that is so varied, sometimes contradictory, does not go ahead.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be rebuilt for party tactical reasons on the issue of being or nothing.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD are to fight, but always have the human life effectiveness in view.
What is feasible and benefits many?
With this key question, both diesel and trace change question can be clarified pragmaticly - and thus recover confidence.
Most importantly, the People's Parties have to fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister for Fisheries
Does the Minister of Labour infringe the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at this more closely.
"Effectly day and night" their legislators had worked on social security reforms, reported an overwhelming social minister in presenting the same two weeks ago.
In the case of list Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprised - it now brings the matter into the Parliament via request.
She assumes "that the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and not to declare violations of applicable service law before running cameras".
Yet, she now has questions to be able to free Har tinger from any suspect.
Police rides a street on the search for women's corpse
Marx green - long the police didn't want to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been buried.
The route is still locked in the area of Marx Green until Monday.
The investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old men, together with his leader in multiple use, could finally confine the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomalia was discovered together with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian Memorial Protection Authority in the area of the said street.
For more than a year, attorney and Criminal Police Hof has been working the crime case.
At Marxgreen, a bike path was closed and examined with sonar equipment because the investigators suspect that in the course of the new construction of the state street, Heikes body might have been sharpened 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonian Year's Day
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is for the first time.
But before it comes to crowns.
The Separatists have not forgotten the police use from autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum dated 1 October 2017, there have been conflicts between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence advocates, among other things, with color powders when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 police officers of Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who had been employed in the election places last year at the illegally recognised referendum.
When attempting to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at that time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central government security forces separately, Spanish media reported.
Some of the about 6000 separatists would then have tried to break through the police chain, and the officials, among other things, struck with color bags and eggs.
Six persons had been arrested that 24 others were easily injured, it was called upon to the authorities.
On Monday, for the first time, the Independence Report is yearning.
Following the vote and subsequent decision to terminate the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under force in autumn 2017.
The former regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also retired abroad.
On the other hand, several Ministers of the regional government and other activists of the Separatist Movement are still in U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the entry into force of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra is also based on the "right on self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected Ratelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-white Ahlen continues to take place.
The FC Gütersloh also had only one 0:0 difference.
The final light and the third last pupped them in front of 438 viewers in the Heidewald Stadium as a collected irregularity.
The first half was overlookable from the entertainment factor.
For this reason, who would prefer to pick up a beer or a bratworst could do this without concern.
There was not the risk of missing a torchance because there was practically no one.
First shot after half an hour
Goodslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) torch of the entire party in the 28th minute.
The best - and, in principle, only real - option had the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes with a shot from the penitentiary border to a parade.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged for injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasingly uprising boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel, from 18 meters, barely over the housing, and after an hour, the goods soldiers appeared for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
Sinan Aygün's "crowded" Nick Flock (62.) with a but-leting shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.), they followed a cornerball of the ex-ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded first Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and some later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahlener did not achieve.
Only in the 91nd minute, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but even it didn't bring in.
Angelo Daut tried to make the positive out: "I liked that we played zero," but unfortunately, the zero also stood ahead.
"We were not as tremendous as against wooden wickedes this time, and that even though our opponent had no intent to play with us," said RW Ahlen's interim trainer.
Offensive, "smoothing everything so a bit" against a team, "who only wanted to defend.
I didn't feel that we could get a countertor," Daut said.
To his suffering, however, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team could shoot a gate.
For that, the idea was too short.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
This is delighted by Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table edition for which these donations are intended.
The honourables assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
In opening, the sky appeared radiant blue, but the place was still a little empty, but that should still change during the day.
Because, "Here it's so pleasant, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the Festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent prise humor.
For the couple of Brockmann, which was actually to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creamers.
And the "substitute" could not take it to talk between the ever-increasing visitors by musical means.
This came so well that a few folk songs were sung in later hour.
"Simply great," pleased Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many active people with their stands, among them mostly associations.
"There should not be something like a table at all," he nevertheless thanked himself for the action of the men's chore.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all who were in use at the stages and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful touch - here's something.
Then the Maikrans was taken from Georg Knorr and Gerd Kluck with the help of the firearm and taken to the winter quarter.
At many stages, it was worked for the physical well-being.
It was all to have from sweet to heartfelt.
Stefan Hagemeeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decopier saw.
Furnier work, beerdckel with Reckenfelder motifs and a lot more he had in offer.
A specialty offered three ridge fields of Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", accompanied by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wederhoven and Helen Roth buschers.
The latter has another specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Then the little Elsa had to access again and again, so well the cake tasted.
The gathering is it that the visitors let stay long to the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Shrubbing with local political message: No successful advertisement for skating plant
In Lengerich, strangers have hardly purchased for the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are similar lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne of the City Administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been punished for damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" were called on signs at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Halle, reports that a corresponding letter on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro had already been discovered after the professional election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message of his time was apparently "only" left with an equestrian, it could easily be removed.
"Single days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed up," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the relevant advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note gets this case just by calling on the table several large companies from Lengerich.
If the skating plant is built, their realisation is to be possible through sponsors.
Assignments are already available, Jörg Hesselmann explains from the urban field of school, sport and culture, without name.
Well possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies standing on the shamed table.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the theme skating plant.
After the old had been rebuilt at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the Council voted in majority for the firefire parking lot.
However, this thought was not converted - too many factors seemed to be against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turn of turns followed.
Members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says to the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word is the city council.
He goes from a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Enhancement in air security is even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European aviation chaos in summer, the German aviation stations see no signs of improvement in the next year.
"In this year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said the chief of the Flight Assurance union, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the Aviation Summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-term notion of staff in the European airlines for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
The market for fully trained lots was empty throughout Europe.
In the center of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized that several air traffic unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hansestadt, on Friday representatives of the Bundes, the countries, the airlines, the airlines and the airports meet to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work pockets and overtimes, this will not go without us," said the Chief of the GdF, who has many members in the German airline company.
Maas again made the EU Commission responsible for the Lotsen-Misere.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been much too low.
The resulting costs and personnel savings in national aviation security sectors now have a full impact on the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) in Brussels for regulations that "do not continue to cut the air off the air".
Currently, EU standards would be voted by 2024, and further intensifications would be feared.
The EU has been constantly exposed to lobby printing by the Airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now harvest exactly what they've sowed in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs in the airlines have been transformed.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German Aviation Assurance (DFS) offered a "unanimous training and future pact", said Maas.
The so far announced recording of 120 lottery students per year over the next five years is rich just to balance the old-related courses.
The necessary personnel building is not yet connected with this.
Thissenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees for Group Construction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans for the conversion of the Group.
After the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was ordered to chair the board at the Sunday meeting, the crystal group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies are supposed to have their seat in Essen and are listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in personnel beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side is only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees face this.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is intended to include the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
The second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG is intended to bundle the business with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos of police and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have led to violent conflicts with numerous injuries.
According to the city administration, some 3000 policemen from all over Spain were gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 advocates of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protest trains from each other.
However, according to the operating forces, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break through security locking.
They had attacked the officials with color and gun shots.
According to the information, ranges were also available between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told you that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and assessment of colleagues
The police had wanted to appreciate their demonstration to the colleagues who had done almost exactly a year ago against the autonomy referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil feel that it is unjust that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they.
The demonstrators emphasized it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why have they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Only in order to provoke and celebrate the fact that they have distorted us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands who wanted to give his name only with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: defending the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there for implementing our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a large European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not come to provoke," the police assured.

Football: Juve Trainer praises for top party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star storms played "in this evening the best game together with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after 3:1 (1:1) - victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the expensively purchased star was also without his own gate of the decisive man in the important party against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," said Allegri.
Even though we started tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to the three tower templates by Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early retirement through the hit of Dries Mertens (10 minutes) and first depended on the worst persecutors.
The Torjäger, occupied by Real Madrid, first presented the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who provided the leadership with a double pack (26/49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by headball, also made the pre-joining to the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.), which only had to be pushed shortly before the gateline.
"He gives many templates," praised the trainer.
But of course, Allegri wants to see gates from the attacker who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese National Team of Record Tower Protectors.
"We need to get better in serving him," the coach asked.
Best Juve-Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchasing of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the overpower of Juventus seems to be even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the makelless series in series A. At 21 points, the master of the seven years behind has already had six counts jump on Naples.
The tabled by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not chanceless against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of Mario Rui (58th) was the top party.
The Portuguese had to get too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the place.
"We played well against a good naple", commented the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel.
The German national player has worked with Juve.
The professional from the FC Liverpool was in use on all seven leagues.
The middle field actor also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "three hour": Ronaldo was flying from the square at the 2:0 victory of the Turiner and was locked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
With a particularly sharp appearance, Rapper Kanye West took care of the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume ensured forknalls and questionnaires among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change for the publication of his new album.
Let's just call him "Ye", the musician.
"The being that was previously known as the Kanye West," he twittered to the deceased singer Prince when he left his artist's name.
However, the pseudonym is not a news.
Already the tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with the KRL radio station, the artist explained that "Ye" has a religious significance for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "du", says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Made!
Hutmar's coach Averhage made no hole from his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simpler, we put him in trouble as well as never before.The list of Hoetmar's capabilities is similarly thin.
Grade two torchances in 90 minutes, so you can only rarely make games positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendinghorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early tour (7.).
In the 43th minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great pre-working of crows, he was free to stand.
The hosts had only a double possibility when Moritz Höne first failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and also found his master at the Sendenhorster Keeper in the poster Jan Blome.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69,) all gave.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjan had saved with the hand on the gateline and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stockered the ball over the line, the party was decided (81.).
"We had previously criticized ourselves hardly, that was then different today than in the past weeks," was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendinghorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Tores: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectakelball in Albania: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't even know what to think about it," he ran by words.
"We don't have any access to them," he thought of the wing singing with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably all the other green whites that appeared with collective offensive urgency.
Still, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, twinkered frech and moved from then his players, however, was the relief that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well noted, after a duell of two teams, one of whom, namely, Albanians, play the championship and the other, Albersloh, fight for class maintenance.
Understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back to the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was our best seasonal performance at a distance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2, how we hold against one of the top teams of the Liga over the whole time, that was really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you now have to drive home with empty hands.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the host with his 12th season tournament (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
==References====References====External links==
We knew that, but that's a player that you can't take out completely.
"That was angry what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent indecently.
Shortly before the side shift, his own elves made the compensation: McGill's left-hand free rope sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through into the long torque (45.).
After the change of the page, it was McGill, who achieved the compensation (59.).
Afterwards, it went back and forth.
It was a cracky, action-loaded game.
Nebel again shocked Albanians (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann was out (69.).
Despite surplus, Albersloh could no longer compete the last Concordia-Treffer (80.) again.
We now have to focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against ships, that's what we have to win," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücher, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nebel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).

Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by mid-year.
France's President Emmanuel Macron has thus signalled to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: he was not at Tutzing's Evangelical Academy as president.
But before and afterwards, Wulf was a guest there.
As a result, Academy Director Udo Hahn, who proudly said, "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us". That at the academy at Tutzing Castle always appeared prominents, but during the presentation of the annual programme was also a topic.
At the end of October, Songmaker Constantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on 29 September, Frido Mann is writer at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron has also agreed: He wants to take the "tolerance prize" to him personally in Tutzing, which also receives TV moderator Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The around 80 meetings by mid-2019 are in themselves.
"The retirement is not sure!" stands in a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - the academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And at a meeting on Syria: "Barbarei without limit".
Arms Deals, Destruction, Fold, Death - the war reproachs every human idea."
From structural racism in society through the screams between arm and empire to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academy director Hahn convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to look for solutions or at least for part-solutions."
At a meeting on 200.
Birthday of Karl Marx in the near future, the more visitors are expecting the direction of capitalism criticism, the others rather a tendency "from left outside to center".
What about neutrality?
"We are a daughter of the Evangelical Landeskirche to 100 percent," said professor Dr. Ulrike Haendenl, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening at the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret testimony, nippled the gender understanding, not only with humor and heartwarming for the (sensitive) woman and the (sensitive) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar set her in and also mastered her violin.
On the wing Ben Süverkrüp sat.
This is one of the male scratching partner, who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrupp Teubner that some may have desired a solo.
It was also there, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, as it fitted with the red thread of the evening.
There, Teubner had played a paradoxon: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but it doesn't open the door.
On the other hand, a closed door without a partner does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would be the result of Mozart's composer, "the nannerl" would have opened the door hopelessly?
So Süverkrüp passes over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head full of blood and wounds" into the "Lide of Death", and from Mozart g-Moll symphony into a playful dance.
There were great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers gave Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But the Chairman Heidemarie Brandbeck could not take additional thanks.
She had the idea of enjoying the Duo in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, also one in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women-Landesliga: Ahlener SG reserves against TV Wattenscheid almost the white West
The aoleans had problems mainly with the third-liga player Carolin Stallmann, who only marked ten matches.
"Especially I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many gates.
We haven't managed them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry with the many outgoing opportunities.
The concentration at the end of his team missed this time.
The ASG, therefore, ran after a retirement almost until the end, at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only by the end, the broader bank of hosts became crucially noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu placed backspace Merle Klement on the left outside, which then made "extrem clever the crucial gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschketter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), p. Fitzek.
Fullyball: 3. Liga Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the full-eyball women of the BSV Ostbevern have re-established in the top group of the 3. Liga West.
At the twotliga VC allbau Essen won the blue whites with 3:1.
"That was a great step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
This is what we have done," trainer Dominik Münch welcomed his team's almost unprecedented performance at the crashed table leader.
The first passover was almost dominated by the guests.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice champion of the previous year with 25:15.
Food has accepted in the two locks, but hasn't come into the game.
We've done it well.
Our opponent has hit up with a high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has changed the acceptance to three bars.
We couldn't keep the impact pressure.
Food has varied, and we've let ourselves go a little," Münch continues.
At 18:17, the full-eyball women from the Ruhr region had the nose for the first time.
Although East Bevern turned off four balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found his goal.
"The game was now a class better," the training leader was at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and final Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the use of the BSV in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "There we played consistently and quietly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the blue-white passage brought four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught a fine day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) criticized the way in which the great Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a scorpion in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be converted easily," said the president of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network of Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance of a common, reconciling appearance.
"Statt side by side with German top politicians to underline the belonging of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The large outlet of the German public has "enhancing many reservations".
Home Club Nottuln: Offer has already established
After the long summer break, folktreff time is finally again.
On October 18th (Donnerstag) at 19.30 p.m., the home association of Nottuln has already organized its fifth emergency folktreff in the fireplace room of the Old Officer.
Almost on the day it is then a year ago that we have done a folktreff for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln", Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Home Association.
I didn't think that our Folktreff was blurring so fast in Nottuln.
Whether in January or in the heat wave, the fireplace of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next folktreff is like always a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folksongs, Evergreens and old beaters," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who regularly invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer agreed with his accordion on the first folktreff "Birthday".
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the district of Steinfurt, who played music with record German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The leaders of the Folktreffs remember the last event in summer when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten enthusiasticed the listeners with its international version of the song "Friends in the night" and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a happy and humorous evening again," says the home association's invitation.
Anyone who plays an instrument and likes to engage in actively is invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always fast, it is recommended to be there in time enough.
The Folktreff starts at 19.30 p.m. but the entry is already at 7:00 p.m.

For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October so that merger can succeed.
From pure fruit production to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the district association for gardening and country care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last impetus for the district association for gardening and national care Kulmbach was set, and just 125 years later, he celebrated a large anniversary in the Kulmbacher City Hall on Saturday evening.
In 1893 he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa, who was the "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land".
The purpose of the fruit-building association also differed from today's work - it was really pure about fruit-building, flowers and gardening at that time no one thought.
"At that time, in the epoch of the information, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Kreisheimpfleger Günter Dippied in his feast presentation.
Fruit trees should be cleaned by remote roads, and schools have been built so-called industrial gardens.
The fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 gardening associations in the Kulmbach district, which include almost 7000 members.
But this does not make the spectrum exhausted at all.
A natural gardening, biological plant protection, village enchanting and nutrition plays an equally important role as in providing knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
How versatile the tasks of a garden building association are, the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulworfen" showed entertaining at stage.
"Youth work is urgently necessary, especially in the digital age," said the circular president Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of life experiences in nature.
The collection of chestnuts was a great deal for us children, I doubt that you can collect a lot of joy with smartphone & co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with the Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner to the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the Kreisverband decides," complemented the Söllner Landrat and highlighted the special importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The Circular Association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the district also made no doubt that the head of the district and consultant Friedhelm Haun did.
He led the many visitors with a picture presentation through the long history of the circuit association and reported, among other things, the need for self-supply after the war.
Previously, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was invaded.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the farm garden changed to a coach and living garden.
"The nature has survived, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to her," the expert asked for fruit and nuts trees.
That is why there is the incentive for the gardening associations to avoid leaving our home to remain beautiful and worth living.
In addition, the president of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl, added to the new citizens in our associations.
"We have to stop the eclatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandsons," Günter Reif closed the successful festivals that were celebrated by the towers of the music club Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister delegates UN-Rede
Mexico's government wants clarity in matters of Nafta: They represent both trade partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now admits absolute priority to the trade agreement - and shifts its speech in front of the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure to ring for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland moved her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen informed.
In the meantime, they concentrate on the renewal of Nafta.
The Mexican Minister of Economics, Ildefonso Guajardo, said on Friday that the negotiating leaders of Canada and the USA would have 48 hours to agree if Canada would actually want to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the USA.
In August the USA and Mexico agreed on a recast of the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The conversations about a new edition have been running for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now supposed to be completed, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of the failure of the negotiations, Mexico's designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday to seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, wounded at a trade fair attack, left the hospital.
The extreme ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro after a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo" where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will take public appearances last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician was attacked on open streets during a election campaign in South Brazil at the beginning of September.
In the meantime, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people went to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not") women's associations called for protests against the ex-military.
In social networks, the associations against Bolsonaros also made racist and despised statementsmobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital of Brazil, the protests were mixed with a demonstration of the presidential candidates of the Brazilian Worker Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He came to the place of ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for corruption and is therefore not allowed to candidate.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As an ex-burger champion of the million city of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro in surveys.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in the policy operation for a long time, it is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there is a pick-up on October 28th.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not be successful from this - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known to hate homosexuals and blacks and glorify the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocking with bleaching eliminations.
Another time he said that the followers of Lulas should be shot.

After long disease: Danish Rock Leader died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after long disease, his producer Jörn Jeppesen informed on Larsen's website.
On his death bed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician has been in treatment since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen became known with the band Gasolin, which was enormously successful in the 1970s in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the resolution of the volume in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million plates in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is the most sold album in Denmark.
On Sunday, the Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen honored Larsen in an explanation as "Straßenjungen", which was "contrary to everything but in all the hearts".
The head of the government reminded that the monarchy opponent Larsen had occurred in 2010 on the 70th anniversary of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rocknight in the shoe factory: Volume on press air hammer level
"Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" are the band names of "Here We Stand" and "The Ignition" of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening at the Hall of the Citizens' Shoe Factory: Hardrock pur of three other friendly bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the beginning of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photograph.
There's no trace from lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surroundings - all in the association with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly highlight the about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows to convince the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces of own feather and the CD that appears soon.
In front of the stage, the band's appearance is played to be voting and impressive.
Although "tolerance" calls are not to be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the Trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hardrock is not the same hardrock, demonstrates guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes on classical rock of the 1970s remembering sounds.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesizer is also used.
Not only is the longing, straightforward "Take Me Home" bestowed by the change of melodic passages to the guitar-lasting rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from tonnish acquaintance has, however, played a particular degree of knowledge since its founding in 2005.
Full agility the band presents her hardrock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances before a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - has special stage experience, is obvious and unoverwritten.
Sänger and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sits with the band at the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, very own accents.
Gitarrist Norbert Brinkmann has been delivering a solo that is even higher in the sense of feelings than before, while he runs through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume belongs to such a hardrock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" Rock Night, according to the information of the mixer team at the "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" three-third concert is about 98 decibel.
This is, for example, on the level of press air hammers, but is still clearly below the exclusions of the "Waken-Fesitval" to the "The ignition" on their website.
Earn-bound 120 decibels in dun-driven sound strength as usual in the annual metal steal dish in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlene audience does not need this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and fired a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the transmitted sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man at a sailing aircraft accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At the Mülheim/Essen airport there has been a fatal accident.
A sailing aircraft is crashed on Sunday at a parking at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the crash.
Near the Mülheim/Essen airport, a deadly accident has occurred on Sunday.
As the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reports, a sailing aircraft was crashed at the Messeparkplatz at the airport.
The pilot had died.
As the "WAZ" continues, the airline student had been on board alone - the flyer is supposed to be an entrepreneur.
At the time of the accident, the plane was already in the landing flight.
The crash site is only close to a fixed tent on the airport site.
But there has been an October festival since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly on the rise to the highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park&Ride offer at large events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump calls Kim: "And then we fell in love."
The fact that the US President of North Korea's captain Kim is very well-beinged despite nuclear crisis is not a mystery.
But now Trump has made his colleague a genuine declaration of love.
She also has to do with Kim's "Wonderful Letters".
At a decent age of 72, the married US president has known himself as a new flame.
The tragedy: It's a remote relationship.
In all public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean captain Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
Before followers in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old sponge of the rulerdynasty from Pjöngjang, although in the rings around North Korea's atomic disarmament proved to be quite tough breachs.
"I was knalling, he too, and between us it went and then," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote beautiful letters to me, they were great letters.
Their personal connection also brought political fruits: Trump pointed to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics behind it have seen little more than lips.
That the affection for the "Rocket Man", as Trumps nickname for Kim, whether his martial threatening, should not be any memoryer, seemed to be well aware of the US president.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of it when he appeared in a large sports hall in Wheeling City: "Donald Trump says they were in love."
How horrible, how horrible is that?
That's so unpresidial.
But he cares very little, said Trump, and then directed his point-finger to the crowd: "I always told you, it's so simple to be presidial."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this splendid arena, but we'd have only 200 people outside.
October festival attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visits, moodful and above-now spoiled by sunshine: Very varied and with a good shot of October festive flair, Baesweiler's city center was poured out on Sunday.
For the first time, the October festival was not merely held in the festival at the firefire tower, but was extended by the business association on Sunday to the city.
Refugees saved through video from Libyschem Prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya using a mobile video and thus enable their salvation.
The group had turned in her cell in the coastal town of Sawija under risk of life in July and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alarmed the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flew out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had taken the video, AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in attempting to reach the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he made himself in danger of life according to his own statement.
One of his competitors had been pleaded by the guards almost to death, said Onyeka.
Generally, the imprisonment conditions were catastrophic: "They struck us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees strangled in Libya.
This year, some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their home by the program, said the IOM speaker in the west African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now saved Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the bad imprisonment conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard from a phone video call.
International organisations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhuman.
The North African state, which is dominated too widely by militia, is the main passing country for migrants on the road from Africa to Europe.

At 16:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front house of the 1st floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
Only through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a steep into the ground floor or the front.
The teacher communicated the police that took up the investigations.

Germans were caught in their own car for days

Rescue forces discovered the car on Saturday afternoon accidentally close to a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, the police informed on Sunday.

He told me to look forward to his home now.
The pensioner was reported as missing by his family after he had not returned from a ride with his terrain car over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search measures, the man's stay was unclear for days.
Laschet admonishes the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has, in the conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in accordance with its own information, contacted the rule of law in Turkey.
The relationships of the two countries are currently "overschatted," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Cologne Airport.
This concerns mainly arrest waves, press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore made "now clear that if relations are to be normalised in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite".
Laschet, according to his own information, also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of opinion should be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The talk of Laschet and Erdogan was moved to a building of the airline preparedness of the Federal Defense Ministry at the Cologne Airport.
Originally it should have been done at Wahn Castle - but it had been rejected by the castle owners from political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to open the Ditib Moschee in Cologne.
Laschet had refused a joint appearance in the construction work.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Missing confidence in the USA: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the success in the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the ostasia regime represents the conditions more nutritious.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a meeting of Washington.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has proposed the US government at the UN General Debate to block negotiations for a nuclear weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest abstinence is therefore that the US builds on forced measures that are fatal to trust education," said Ri in New York.
A disarmament is indispensable to North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to open ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat issued.
The fact that penalties could force North Korea on the "knee" is "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed a nuclear test system, Ri raised.
However, from the US side there have been no "comprehensive reactions", the minister criticized.
Due to North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone had decided three times sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have in the past days forced the United Nations to strictly respect criminal measures.
At the same time, the US government is working on a approach.
In June, Trump had first met North Korea's powersman Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President seeks a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will go to Pjöngjang again to talk about the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth strike, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet waiting for the guests after the harvest thank God service.
The youngsters of the HoT had the buffet with delicacy from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not just as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were best prepared for the great day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power failure had put the huge two-part fridge out of operation, the food was corrupted and had to be disposed.
"Now we had to start again from the front: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to create it alone," says Westbuer.
And that's how everyone packed up.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"A better cook can't do it," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido's kitten was served or the guests were allowed to serve at quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on the legs," said Pfarrer Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen made a lot of amazement with cards and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board NRW the table
From frustration about criticism from its own rows, the chief of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, delivered his posts in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known throughout the country because the Essen table had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice Chief of the NRW Tafels, Sartor said the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen too many in my back.
The Chief of the Tablen-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding of the decision of his long-term alternate representative.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
"I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table made it."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "Six days a week, there is nothing going on", said Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized in the "World on Sunday" again criticism of colleagues of other tablets.
You may not follow the approach, "without starving the people in the city".
It is the task of the State to ensure that people did not die.
The Essener did not participate in a convention of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"There's been told me too much sweet shame," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that criticized me that way.
Play SF Lorch 2:0 Guide - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Districtliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV hypocrites victory in Kirchheim after retirement - bedringes strike Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0, Lorch was already in charge of the TV Newler - at the end of the 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Very different from the TV hypocrites: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly reached the back meeting with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. On the table tip, the SGB could then with a 3:0
Gladbach plays two times leadership - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz to the first season victory (1:0).
(sda) Four times, Schalke was maneuvered in the first five league games with early towers.
Now, Domenico Tedesco's team again put that strength on the day with which it had held the first place behind the Bavaria in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home equipe in the eleventh minute after strong pre-working of Jewgeni Konopljanka by head, in which the hosts preserved the minipolster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund welcomes newly from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated against Bayer Leverkusen a 0:2 backing until the break, but in the second half, it was still a 4-2 win.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) appeared with a doublette in four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was switched by Favre in the 63th minute, provided another doublette in the final phase (86./94).
The first victory was the VfB Stuttgart.
Against the yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic, Werder Bremen had to fear the Stuttgartians in the meantime before the break.
Borna Sosa and the unattractive Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curiosic property gate that helped guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a happy, but also a misleading debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher who arrived with the Swiss Quartet Yann Summer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a two-time tour, played 2:2 and still waited for an outward victory in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible with his second Federal Lieutenant.
Yann Summer was powerless at the 20 meters of the Aargauer, as well as at the second counterpart after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite desperate.
Alassane Pléa appears in the storm of the foals as a goalgetter.
At Wolfsburg, the French recording purchase received from the OGC Nice came for the third time in succession and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach runs the 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unsettled Werder Bremen against the VfB Stuttgart managed in an uncomfortable situation.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt is surprised by a Stuttgart conterent, which the Ex-Luganesi Anastasiosios Donis concluded with his first seasonal trip, and after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serbe collected after a Tricotzup against Daniel Didavi Gelb-Rot.
Even though Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back to the game by a curiose host (68th), a quarter hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarter's overwhelmingly acting back to the victory street.
Nuremberg decided the Duell against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereign for himself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already took the home team on course through Foulpenalty.
Macedonian votes on new national names
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens agree whether the name of their country is to be changed in northern Macedonia.
With a yes, the almost three decades of conflict with the neighbours of Greece could be solved.
Athens had been on a name change because of his northern province and blocked every approach to Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future West integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become Nato member at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrer in U-Haft.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian cruelly cruelized three retirement girls and injured them in part.
The 41-year-old asylumwer had randalized in the escape gas in Alsergrund on Friday at 22 o'clock.
When the police arrived, they talked to the accused who went off with balled fists on passengers and tried to attack them on his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to strike and step the officials.
A few later, it was found that the suspect had hit three older women (65, 67, 75) with his fists on the ground in the Währinger Street.
He also stepped the trio with his feet.
The retirement women were partially severely injured.
They suffered haematomas, bursts and brain shocks.
The asylum advertiser was also severely injured "for still unknown cause," as it was said by the police.
He was taken into the hospital and monitored continuously during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost a year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician John Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave their vows in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" period.
"If we marry, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary speaker of the SPD-Bundestag fracture and one of the speakers of the Seeheim circle, the conservative SPD flight.
In the Bundestags debate on the opening of the marriage for Homosexuale, Kahrs had excited with an anger on June 30, 2017.
So he had suggested Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) to have a "stolpert" theme.
"That was your Schabowski-moment," he said in a presentation of the accidental proclamation of the DDR front-opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, the same sex couples can marry just like heterosexuale.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the adoption law.
Garden Day: 400 meters crochet
There was a lot of work before the members of the Civil Association Children's House and the Society for Leprakunde.
For around 400 metres of gates around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfrunnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said the president of the Civil Association Walter Schröer.
And it also gathered a lot of things.
Due to the hot summer, we are late this time, but fortunately, it is just a form cut.
Because in the spring, the hooks have already been shaved.
The breakfast that is always on work has a long tradition too.
"It's all to stay with forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner collects gold at the Kanuslalom-WM
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Kanuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
On Sunday, the 29-year-old put a perfect course on the Olympic stretch.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympia-Bronze at three hundred-seconds.
I was well prepared, had already had enough rides here on the plant and it has fitted everything today," said the Olympia Third of London 2012.
In the goal, he threw away his pedestrian from joy and scattered both arms victoriously to the height - well-knowledging that it would be at least for a medal.
After all, he had the start number four.
But the six still remaining launchers couldn't pick up his fabel time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting mentioned the first attempt to break this autumn into a family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days will be shorter - that will make infringers use again.
This is how the police inspector Gauting mentioned yesterday the first attempt to break this autumn.
The alarm system is due when trying to stay at the Einfamiliehaus on the Königswieser Straße.
It happened when the perpetrators put hand on Friday shortly before 20 o'clock on Friday.
The infringers realized that the inhabitants were not at home.
The alarm system, however, seemed to surprise her that she took the escape without a probe.

Pleite at Hertha: Invented by reality: Bavaria against Ajax demanded
The predicature is inconceivable: The defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bavaria "not to be liked".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim panel for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small range of power under the new coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase to the larger native depth for the Munich.
"Before a week you had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we got a bit of reality," Thomas Müller observed after the deserved 0:2 deposit at Hertha BSC and demanded a response for the Champions League-Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, he knows that it's really angry with us and that's why we give us gas to Tuesday.
For the first time, for more than a year, no own gate shot out, as at the same time of the preceding season two compulsory games in series without victory, the table management in the football bandsliga first lost on Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation has not been as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record master must have been warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intensive man-general tactics and the Berliner through their playful needle sticks over the outside have delivered the same two blue breaks within three days, as the last overpowering Bavaria can be knacked.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we'll do everything so that we'll be successful again," Kovac emphasized.
However, otherwise, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his birthtown and just pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach to the again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still have a positive effect on the first interim conclusion of his term of office before the country playing break - otherwise, the sound should be intensified.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second king class appearance of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax begins, which had also forced AEK Athens sovereign with 3:0.
"Now it's caught us in two games, but we're going to make our gates again," announced National Team Chairman Manuel New.
As after the lost pokalfinale against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clear text.
The legal defendant appeared in the role as a Mahner.
"I don't think that this is all pech, we have to do it again, because we don't make the number of chances and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before the departure from the Olympia Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous playtime, the Bavaria were already with five meters behind Dortmund, which has now taken over the top again with a point of advance.
And so Kimmich was at least positive with a eyedrinker that now the public debate about the supposedly invaluable Bavaria has ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Schussline: Özil-Causa: Sharp attacks from Erdogan to Grindel
With severe accusations, the Turkish president Erdogan pleads an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the band line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on various stages for the interpretation of the permanent streak theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president criticized the dealing with the ex-world championship in Germany for the opening of the major Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB Chief defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, the Grindel attacked by Özil personally sharply in the Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio" announced consequences from the Causa.
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds - that this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player with no migration background as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again explained that Erdogan was not standing for the values of football and DFB.
With sharp words, it had arranged racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our born and grown Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they were allowed to photograph with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the Domstadt.
As her president, I was honestly unable to dignify it that our two young men, who rose up to the German national team, were excreted.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil after the WM affair, which had taken their start by photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt "conspicuously treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced that he would want to move ahead of players in the future.
That someone says, if I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm migrant - that's not gonna happen.
"That he has such an impression, I am very sorry," said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said that.
He does not see a basis for a return to Özils to the national team either.
In addition to the born Brasilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, which has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer will now be called.
"If a person without migration is clearly involved in society and football, saying, "The topic is important, we have to take care of," this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the spot where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-Aus und Özil-Affäre, he wants to reapprove the office as a DFB president in the next year.
"I do my work and try to make them as good as it is," said Grindel.
Yearly builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police reported, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 o'clock.
First, the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady at the red ample in the field of Lauterer Höhe.
This told the pensioner that he would have driven against her car.
However, a personnel exchange did not come because the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking area.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who would get away from the street and drive against a guiding past.
To that end, the man didn't want a police on site and then went away from it.
Afterwards, the Rödentaler went home.
However, the pensioner in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, has processed and a vehicle has slipped in turn.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a stronger impression and couldn't feel much more.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorfire in Meppen: still almost 1000 forces in use.
About four weeks after the eruption of the Moorbrand on a Federal Army site in Emsland, 980 forces are still employed with the deletion work.
That told the Federal Army on Sunday.
As the situation of a spokesman continues to develop stablely, the last 70 representatives have been deducted.
Another reduction in the number of operating forces was planned.
In the night of Sunday, an oberirdic fire was discovered and deleted.
Last week, the disaster case was lifted, which was called well a week earlier on September 21, because it was feared that the flames were threatened by wind and radio flight adjacent forests and settlements.

In time, more than 1500 operating forces tried to get the large fire under control.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Federal Army Test Station at Meppen with a transport heap screw.
There are also information flights with drones of the Federal Army.
For the 2nd and 5th October, according to the Federal Army, exploration flights are also planned with "Tornados".

When we get married, right.

The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary speaker of the SPD-Bundestag fracture and one of the speakers of the Seeheim circle, the conservative SPD flight.
In the Bundestags debate on the opening of the marriage for Homosexuale, Kahrs had excited with an anger on June 30, 2017.
So he had suggested Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) to have a "stolpert" theme.
"That was your Schabowski-moment," he said in a presentation of the accidental proclamation of the DDR front-opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, the same sex couples can marry just like heterosexuale.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register aims to facilitate donations of organs and to remedy members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that institutions may continue to be taken only with explicit consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland launches an electronic register for organ donors on this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donations and reduce members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in death can be registered there.
Your wishes are then available in the case of Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change that institutions, as in Germany, may continue to be withdrawn only with explicit consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss people have a donor certificate, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card is found at the decisive moment of possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, family members do not know the desire of the deceased.
"They will then have to decide deputy in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the hospital card, as the spokesman of the Federal Center for Health Information says, Marita Völker-Albert.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - pro or contra organ donation - there is no one," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken for a re-regulation of the organ donation.
According to its proposal, everyone would be considered an organ donor unless he or his relatives contradict.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old pupil is world champion in the head calculation
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in the headquarters.
He went to Wolfsburg on the weekend against 39 competitors.
It announced Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the exploration place of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greeting from Germany was the third place.
The recent WM participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, who was the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as Chief-Secret Ralf Lauue said.
The computer professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes competition every two years.
Previous tasks were: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, with participants from the audience with a pocket calculator.
Wenzel Greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when cracking.
He's one of seven Germans in competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Greeting was in Bielefeld for two years ago as a 14-year-old.
With terms such as superhern, genius or wonder child, organizer Laue can little start.
"Coupsum can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even computing competitions in stages.
Among the disciplines, for example, are the square root pulling from six digit numbers.
The candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to find a solution strategy quickly when expecting plurality.
Here, too, the Germans would have good opportunities, said the main judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often benefited because in the early childhood, head calculations are more intense and with other effective methods taught.

Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes her beds for the first time in the west: Polare cold air reaches Monday Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys, it can slew down to 1,000 meters at strong intensity.
From Bregenzerwald to the High Tauern, above 2,000 meters can be expected to be 20 to 40 centimeter of new snow.

Farmers may begin on Monday with the yearly care
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers may begin on Monday with the annual chicken care.
The unique "green forests" in Germany have been the countryside of the forestry country for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree and straps are "Waldersatz" and for many animals and plants the last withdrawal rooms.
Knicks combine as corridors distributed living spaces that can still operate the exchange of organisms, as the manager of the German Naturschutzbund (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living teeth
The Knicks were established on the basis of a command by the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living tea" were not only field limitation and livestock, they also delivered the farmers fuel wood and bars for their professional workshops.
From that time onwards his name "Knick": By "cnicking" the branches, the dense, curled delimitations could develop.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea, some 45 000 kilometres of the slopes extend and give the picture of a helicoptery, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by some 7000 species as a replacement habitat.
In a mile of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and brew up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only fulfill the knick if it is maintained in the winter accordingly.
Otherwise, he cares for a light tree series, which, besides the variety of species, also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
Cnick care may be operated only outside the gross period from October to March according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about SItuation on site
In the interview with the German editorial network (RND) the local radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and the tsunami:
Were you on the spot during the tsunamis?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at that time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then when I learned about the tsunami, I made myself on the way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours of car, since the airport was closed on Palu at the time.
How's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown into.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have prepared something for a preliminary time, where we also housed other people.
What are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have ran on surrounding hills, on which they still endure from fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they do not have access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their houses, there are still nights.
Because many food shops and also the tank stations are completely closed, people partly clue food and petrol.
The public service has been completely dropped, the national government helps out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners are partly running free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island running?
At the moment we have hand-feeding, but it did not work before, and we only got information about radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people who do not know whether they live and stop them because people were not at home during earthquakes, for example, on the workplace.
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no Tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by Tsunami, there was the wrong information that a tsunami meets the region and they were rendered to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Firering, prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst one here.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure is broken together, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief to Schalke is great after the first season victory.
Nevertheless, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - Meanwhile it is known that Christian Heidel is a giant pessimist in football games.
This wasn't different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our criminal room," said the Sports Board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
Finally, the king's blues were still able to bring the almost 1:0 against the Rhine hessen over time and thus the first season victory under roof and specialist.
In fact, it could have come differently.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of chief trainer Domenico Tedesco had given safety, Tedesco said: "The first half was good, both playful and pressing.", with increasing duration of play, apparently more and more of the head played.
Actually, don't create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand."
The boys were afraid to give that out of their hands and therefore retreated.
And with man and mouse defending Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no essential part of it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the manship."
But at the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start pressurefully during the initial phase and make a fireworks from it," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we need to take part over 90 minutes
The biggest manco of the afternoon: King's blue missed it rather for more clear conditions to worry.
Finally, there were opportunities for this, such as through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the Latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a citer victory," said Tedesco, "You already felt the fear a bit".
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only scarf.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye height
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani, stands before them.
He was followed for the repeated time of the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to get interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association who cooperates with the alliance "Culture Policy" at the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani gets very loose into the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject understandable.
With a lot of getics, hand-resistant numbers and some joke, he brings the listeners one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Despite successful integration, why are there increasing conflicts?
The Syrian author uses to answer the question of a metaphor.
On one table, the German society, on the cat table, is the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat on the big table and want to vote with them.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive to say whether to arrange politically or to the left, but to say, "I am for or against an open society?" he stresses.
In the beginning, the discussions are going to be more and more regrettable.
And there is a need for speech.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective to tell two teachers how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in pupils.
El-Mafaalani is present, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is at the height of the eyes.
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fate.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the subject, because "first when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he has been more intensively discussing an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the Foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities.

The municipality of Pliening sold the first plots in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.

Place for 200 people

Schalkes Naldo also succeeds in "great sport" on the bank
For the third time not in the start elevator: Naldo at Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco, however, thanks.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time, not in the Schalker Startel, but in the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the nearly two meters of Brazilians had spoken the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered as usual in the middle circle after the 1:0 win over the FSV Mainz 05 and thanked the chief trainer Domenico Tedesco at all his professionals, the 36-year-old who calls all the simpleness of Naldo turned in and said, "We have to thank, Trainer!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who had no grief despite his re-reservist system.
Truscheinlích knows Naldo, who was celebrated as the best scalker in the past season, that he actually did not get a break at his trainer – but for good reasons.
One reason called "business control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you that very honest," said Tedesco about the moment he had told Naldo that he wasn't in the start elevator.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco justified the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bavaria and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that at the moment all can go through.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which recently also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: he also showed himself to the bank as an exemplary team player.
The atmosphere in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its valleying in August compared to the euro area.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was on a 37-month depth with 46.7 points.
However, Austria has the thirdmost mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands throughout Europe, the Markit Institute informed on Monday about its survey among 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the PMI of the Euro-Zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still the 13th month in a row below the brand of 50 meters that suggest growth.
Only Ireland's industry knacked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks were final light (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer dropped, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level of 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit-Ökonom Rob Dobson.
But in the third quarter, the industry remains one growth brake number.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have not fallen as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore degraded the seventh month in succession.
In China, industrial production also fell stronger than initially adopted in August.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had expected 47.8 points at first.
The shopping manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
The developments in turnovers, employment, warehouses and prices will be raised among others.
