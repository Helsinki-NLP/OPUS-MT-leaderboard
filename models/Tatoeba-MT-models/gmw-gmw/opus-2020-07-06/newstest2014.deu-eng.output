Gutach: More security for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres away: On Tuesday, the new B 33-Footgangrampel was taken in Gutach at the village park - in view of the older town hall.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or shielding?
This question clearly answered Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The town hall was then installed because it secures the school road," explained Eckert yesterday.
The club-ample secures both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain-le residents.
The plant officially operated yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, the Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank and the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian rise, there had to be another ample for their safety," said Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"On the B 33, current measurements run about 12 000 vehicles per day the municipality of Gutach, of which is about 10 percent heavy load transport," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another ample is more than necessary: "Security is just going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic views had been carried out, and a circulation was also planned, but because of the close in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area, it was rejected again.
According to Arnold, it has been tested at the location selection of the amplers before: "With an extra extra for us with particularly long wooden trunks of loaded transporters, we have determined whether these vehicles can drive from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without knicking around the amplers".
The approximately 15 000 euros of the cost of the lighting system itself is the "modernest thing currently on the market", Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that illuminate so strongly that the lights of the car drivers can be well identified, for example, even at the deep sun.
And it is also saving: The older lighting facilities consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per ride.
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
Press the pedestrian to the ample button, the upper radar sensor testes the traffic position.
If the road is free, immediately green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people are going across the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone is safely coming over the train," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver has to think of this as a partner and watch the train.
This wasn't the case yesterday: hardly showed the amps for pedestrians green, a high-class vehicle evaporated through - in lightning red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the impression of rough violence and stumping sexuality, the tightness and joylessness - have often described the ceremony poet.
Known is the German prize winner, especially as a prosa author, theatre texts are rar in his work.
Collage from Prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher combines a collage of prosa texts for his performance "Weatherlights on the tip of the tongue", which is now seen in the garage X at the Petersplatz.
The theatermaker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "The Body Owner" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, his family admonishing" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important requirement: a screwd sofa, on which reference is copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the textile material.
Regisseur Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance interprets the presentation with a plenty of regime incidents, known from the repertoire of postdramatic game forms.
Especially the actresses come with some questionable scenic implementations.
They are tightly touched, dived with the head under water, packed with their evening robes on the wall.
Included in cellophan or mistress, they stack on dangerously high sticks through the inscension, either monologize them loudly or completely stumbled on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly conveying in this effort.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only by the end the overwhelming performance comes a bit to rest, and Winkler's absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that finds place in the armature board of each car.
The equipment that records every moving kilometer and reports the information to the authorities is the key point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the Federal States to revise the obsolete system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly developed an intensive debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have been associated with environmental groups and consider that the government can use the small boxes to record the traveling kilometres – and perhaps where they have been driven – and then use the information for the calculation of tax decisions.
The Tea Party is absurd.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while you can’t agree on a procedure at the convention, several states no longer wait.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system during the next ten years, where drivers pay per drove mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we can only use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the driven miles on all California cars in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes, was pleaded by US Americans at the Zapfsäule.
But in America no longer gets as much tonight as before.
Cars consume less petrol.
The State Mineral Oil Tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocent per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax at high pricing prices.
"The gas tax is simply not future," says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport law at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a miles-based payment system.
"This represents the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
bureaucrats call it a miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberals because, for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that stiffs and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
The Californian Planers set up the system for the development of strategies aimed at reaching the ambitious, legally anchored objectives of the state for climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also explained that he sees the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also committed by the idea of allowing drivers to pay for the route down.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Reason's directives.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who in a 2011 report had asked the Congress to move towards miles-based accounting.
The US Senate approved last year a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the pretext and thus responded to the concerns of deputies from rural areas, representing people who often have to move many miles to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities are moving on their own foot in this direction.
The most engaged is Oregon, who currently produces 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment of the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles to the state rather than the mineral oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois testes it to a limited degree with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which is part of the transport departments of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, car drivers were skeptically thinking that the government could follow any of their movements.
"Acts about Big Brother and such things were a major problem," says Alauddin Khan, head of the strategy and results management of the Nevada Transport Ministry.
People didn't want it.
When the test went on, the ACLU of Nevada warned: “It would be relatively easy to convert the drivers into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build up a gigantic, spare technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of federal states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can record the traveled kilometres, but not exactly when and where.
That, as Khan said, would be more reassuring to the public.
The hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not originally begin to help state taxation of drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take foot in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of the drove miles.
But the devices tested by them are also interesting for road planners because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
"The people are more willing to take part in it if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs have made great mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planers experiment to give car drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't choose a device at all and instead pay a fee on the basis of the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with fewer ones.
In New York City, traffic officers want to develop a taxation device, with which parking fees can also be paid, insurance must be paid only for travelled kilometres and speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid barriers.
"Autofahrers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to participate," says a planning document in the city.
Some transport planners, however, wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials explained that the Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or an annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair proportion.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Head of Law and Public Affairs.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things.
Kingsfeld: Little team sleeps awake
The volunteer firearm tested her autumn head test despite the lack of personnel with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Chairman of the department Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate spring in the Burgberger Straße in his exercise.
There was supposedly a short closure in the saw.
The resulting fire and smoke development injured two people, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of Hans Kammerer's affairs, two respiratory guardians made ready to enter the building.
After a short time, it succeeded in finding the first person and leading to the free.
The second person had to be worn.
This wasn't so easy, as a tight staircase was also to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it.
Further, there were electrical machines for wood processing.
The first removal attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made over a flood hydrant in about 100 metres away.
Now three deletion attacks could be made.
A hollow ray tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what can be achieved with little personnel available.
In a serious case, support is made by the Kingsfeld daily use group.
The commander showed himself satisfied with the expiry of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
At his visit to Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald Landtag President Guido Wolf has also been informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers came from tomorrow.
In the Promotion Centre of Hochschwarzwald, he examined this important question together with the executive school directors of the vocational schools as well as the district of thegymnasium and the parents' chairman.
"Education is an important location factor," pointed out Claudia Stehle, director of Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, a successful cooperation has been established in the forest town between the funding centre, the district ofgymnasium and the vocational training centre.
He also praised family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a look at the family phase but also the phase of care for family care because of demographic change," Wolf said.
In addition, he suggested that more and more employees were caring for the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden of employees can lead to the end of the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Whoever has come to know the advantages of the region during his studies, with its acquired knowledge and skills often receive the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the country-day president was convinced.
For only if sufficient training places were offered, the need for professionals could be covered.
He believes that the location beneficiary of the district is its beneficial location in the southwest of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already made to develop public transport on his route from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"To remain persistent and ensure that public transport is improved," he explained to the address of the local politicians present.
With music experience a entertaining afternoon
For 15 years the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger Seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the older fellow citizens were inhabited in the lawn.
This afternoon takes place in St. Joseph's nursing home.
The homes were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was worst salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were talking with common melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front demarcation of the old schoolyard in front of the renovation to the Kirchstraße is to be re-established with the rehabilitation plan of the city of Brunlingen.
In the days before Kilbig, in the first work of the renovation of the front schoolyard, a small angle wall was built to stabilize and static discharge of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with Balustrade.
Alexander Misok from the Bräunling City Building Office provides for further action to include the National Memorial Office in planning and to create a rehabilitation concept for the old wall.
Afterwards, a cost calculation should be made by experts who will then be put on the table to the municipal council for the decision and adoption of the further procedure.
It is expected that a decision will already be taken in the next year.
After the rehabilitation, planting and planting of the old schoolyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it must be done in time foreseeable as a follow-up measure, the needy limiting walls of the ground to be renovated and placed on new underbuilding.
The historic one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as no drainage is present, needy rehabilitation and has a bognification ahead.
Deep cracks in individual stones show weather damage, but the wall is currently not threatened.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school court used by students, which has been done by the current fortification work.
Originally, the school court was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplannable expenditure brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school walling, which has even been used for film recordings, will speak to the National Memorial Office.
If the specifications come from this site, the city of Brunlingen hopes for grants from the monument guards.
The students of Bräunling's primary school, who are now being retired in a well-healthed old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old school court.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now turned into the ongoing discussions about the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up holistic training at the music university in Stuttgart," said Özdemir the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classics are currently in Stuttgart's jazz location.
In this way, Özdemir, who is Favorit for a direct mandate at the Bundestagswahl on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Rote Landesregierung in Stuttgart.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, the Jazz and Pop course will be transferred from the University of Music to Mannheim.
US border: "Super-tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and settled a "Super-Tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US inch authorities reported, the more than 500 metres long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were thus arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel has not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid, if they think they could dig through under the radar," said the U.S. State Attorney General of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a camphouse in San Diego, where it had been discovered an end of the tunnel.
To the drug bands, Duffy assured: "If you continue building such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cards.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the difficult equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place about a year.
The rail system was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On Mexican side, the access is located in a building that is 80 metres from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads to the depth of 20 meters to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1,20 metres height and 90 centimeter width.
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration towards the US.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine found.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the occupied marijuana.
All three threaten as a maximum penalty for lifelong liberty, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered at the press conference in San Diego.
But it's the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel building.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of the drug bands, whose traditional routes were now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the Drug Race DEA in San Diego.
They would do everything to get to the US.
No details were given to those arrested, at least one was Mexican, it was said.
You have to expect prison sentences up to ten years.
2014 is the Geisinger festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on 1250.
Returning the first curriculum mention gets ever closer.
When the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary year rises.
Geisings and church houses were mentioned 794 for the first time together.
In churches a document was produced where both places are mentioned.
On March 15th, there is an official opening for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this event takes place in the place where both were mentioned for the first time 1250 years ago, in church houses.
In the context of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen, as well as in church houses.
Church Houses will be the 1250 in July at a weekend of 18 to 20 July.
Five again.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
At this weekend there is also the church-house celebration.
City music director Rudolf Barth wrote a commission composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On June 21st, together with the sunning celebration of the Black Forest Association, on July 12th, in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13th, the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This is completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last week of September, 27 and 28 September.
A new chronicle is also released at the Geisinger Stadtjubiläum.
"But it is to be a chronicle not only by Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the aging of today, which is just made up of geisings, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen", says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the Geising of today celebrates 2014 birthday, in 1974 the space has been executed with the communes.
The new chronicle will then be presented in the new festival hall in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a customs evening on the occasion of its 60-year-old existence, the Harmonie Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the festival bed on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10th, the music club Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the well-feest from July 4 to 7.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was manufactured in churches (Hausen), which was then courtplace.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason for this 1250-year-old to celebrate accordingly is also 40 years away.
The Council takes lead plants to the visa
Should the crossing "Am Hirsen" be rebuilt to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipal councils decided.
Schiltach must take 220 000 euros to do so.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal track in the next year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety of rail crossings - regularly it comes to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must participate in the costs with one third, the rest share the railway and the covenant.
Schiltach's city master Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the specialities of the Bah transition "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build an excavation at the height of the tunnel wall west of the railway.
There may also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, in counter-transport, without having to block the glues.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could spread the following road at a given time to ensure a smooth transport flow.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, since some councils doubted the need for road distribution: Thomas Kip brought the mood of the critics to the point: "Do we need to take so much money for such few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway transition "Hirschen" was used regularly for longwood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partially transported over this route because the up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route at the haeberles bridge because they could not turn down to the main road.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, Haas argued.
Since Kirchberg- und Schlossbergtunnel should be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the "Hirschen" railway transition could also have an important significance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to examine the costs of the expected spread of the road.
In spite of this, the transformation of the railway transition was generally agreed with the measure that the necessary support walls are built in such a way that the city could, where appropriate, expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" for meeting traffic to approximately 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the transformation of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could draw a very different problem that concerns access to the strongly rising "rolthouses road".
The administration had let the reconstruction plans of the railway by the engineer office Breinlinger, as it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Weg would be possible.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it was not excluded that the inclination conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting.
The responsibility for this is, in turn, the city is being a roadbuilder.
The reconstruction could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both wood outputs and turnings worked in the current expansion state, Haas argued not to agree to the transformation of the railway transition.
Also, at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is considerably lower than the other railway crossings, because it is directly the center of the stop point to which a good viewing connection is concerned.
Even trains from the main station should have been braked in this place so far that no collision was dry.
Mostly, the reconstruction of this railway transition was denied the consent as the city of Schiltach would have to "baden" the problem with seating vehicles, said the councils, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction work.
The Gremium considers the conversions to the railway transitions "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which already crossing agreements were made with the train.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitation waves or black holes - European space agency experts now have to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were selected, five are still in the race.
Far from worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you look for gravitation waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or, after earthlike planets flying and thereby perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These questions are just the responsibility of the European Space Agency for Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are aimed at decisively promoting research.
The food for such "L-Missions" is about a billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, Paris met the elite of European space research to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were about the debate, five of them have now come into the closer choice.
Numerous bodies are considering the proposals, crocheting the researchers.
In the next days a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions has been selected by the Esa to find answers to the missions of the 2007 Cosmic Vision programme.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact events in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets surrounding these stars - are still in promising darkness.
A large infrarotlescoop in the all could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In 2017, the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched with the 500 already known planetary systems in our nearer surroundings.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers can visualize earthlike planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
Finally, this question should also be clarified about the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as its particle radiation with the planet system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined in an example.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (that is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The sin is intended to start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this, the Esa provides the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The Sond "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start their journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and is supposed to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the ice moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The World Hall offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also differences that might point to physicians the way to a new theory, under which all known natural laws can be united.
How did the universe originate and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Urknall.
In addition to our common matter, from the stars, planets and creatures as we exist, there is dark matter, whose heavy force holds galaxies and galaxy hops, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the world is accelerated.
Until now, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the urknall, nor what dark matter and dark energy exist.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved a M-Mission, whose launch is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, allowing conclusions on the nature of darker matter and darker energy.
Who could make the race
The 30 proposals will remain only two at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chances of a authorisation as a L-Mission are, according to many experts, "E-Lisa", a demanding concept for the detection of gravitation waves.
This includes changes in the structure of space, which Albert Einstein had foretold almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven until today.
Elisa could create that, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three sins, which is stationed in the All.
In contrast to earth's plants, he could also demonstrate gravitation waves that have arisen at the Urknall and thus provide new insights about the origin of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are still competing for the second L-Mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outside planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and examine earthlike planets.
There are already proposals for sample transport from Mars, for exploring moon, Venus and asteroids, asteroids, as well as for sunphysics.
Snowden ready to ‘cooperate’ with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. secret service, said that he was willing to travel to Berlin and speak before the German Bundestag when the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander do not give any answers to their activities.
The German Minister Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where this asylum has received to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, this writes: “Although the result of my efforts was proven positive, my government continues to treat a deviating opinion as a disloyal breakthrough and attempts to criminalize political opinion with threats of criminality, where no defence is possible.”
But to say the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government of letting the charges fall against him.
The claim raised by the U.S. Ministry of Justice includes spionage and theft of state property.
German minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to time online: “If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make it possible.”
The relationships between the USA and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA abstained the phone by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for secret service, said that we should take the opportunity to listen to snowden as a witness if possible, “without threatening him and totally ruining relations with the US”.
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published an image of himself and snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists on his visit to Russia.
Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee, Snowden could not return to Russia when he left the country.
If Snowden said in Germany, he would need a assurance that he was "sure" there, the honourable Member.
In his letter, Snowden explains that he was exposed to a “fancy and continuous” persecution campaign that displaced him from his homeland.
However, it was touched by the global response to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have referred to the revealing of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a preservation to the generality.
In his letter, Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation, "when the difficulties have been solved around the humanitarian situation".
Frontier Airlines raises fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to stew hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade, even if in the announcement on Wednesday, that passengers should keep the whole dose.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in luggage box above the seat, small bags below the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier explained that one counts 25 US dollars when the fee is paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who paid at the airport.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of 100 US dollars aims to move travellers, to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she said.
In 2008, airlines began to demand fees for the first and second baggage that was released.
Passengers who tried to handle them have therefore stacked as much as possible into the luggage, resulting in the fact that the luggage containers are often overfilled over the seat.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that at the new fee it's not really about earning money.
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier who had clearly expressed that it became increasingly difficult to find space in the specialist over the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at frontier’s airport may be allowed to take a baggage free of charge, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable baggage.
O'Malley explained that the frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed about the fee before they came to the airport.
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will only enter into force in summer, a exact date is not yet available.
Passengers often shrink over luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to take back on it.
They argue that the transport of baggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wished it.
Many at Wall Street view the new luggage fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flight travel after years of loss.
Most, however, leave the fingers of fees for hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first fee for hand baggage and later Allegiant Air, also a cheap flighter.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully pursues the additional fees.
In a report of December 2011, he estimated that the hand baggage fee would spend 50 million US dollars annually.
Sorensen, who previously had a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious, what would expect him at the flight stage if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand baggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the most smooth in my career in aviation," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth cnirches and handful discussions at the airport.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like smashed."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought limonades or juice should keep the whole box and will be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had attempted to demand money for refreshment drinks, but it reverted seven months later, after passengers had complained and no other big company had been relocated.
Frontiers Step to raise fees for the luggage when passengers are not buying directly from the airline is the latest initiative with which customers should be tied to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per sold ticket.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to direct purchase with them rather than through an online travel agency.
The frontier, however, has gone the most widely in this area.
In September, the company started to grant only half so many frequent flight miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route.
A flight with frontier booked at a third party is therefore only 250 miles from customers.
Passengers can also reserve places exclusively when buying directly on the frontier website.
Frontier has a faithful customer root at its seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The revenue decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity decreased nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the Mother Group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to control frontier finances in the context of the company's sale.
Sayings come from the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last female breakfast this year in the evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipal house were "Sprichwords from the Bible" and "Returns from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, Chairman of the Church Congregation Council, entered the Bible’s words after breakfast in a lecture.
"Spring words contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings," she said.
It compared several words with the corresponding scriptures and explained the significance.
She called words like: Be watchful, as shoes fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone, the Lord gives it in sleep, and wash his hands into innocence.
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners what the word was.
The medieval speeches took place by the church congregation Christianel Dehner: All good things are three, make blue, cut off.
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called "bridges into the past".
A Tombola was released at the end.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously written before they were transferred to the winners.
Among the visitors in the breakfast round, mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger also mixed.
Learning rather than unemployed: pilot project for unemployed in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched at the Mecklenburgese lake plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who have already worked as unemployed in the industry are to be qualified for professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New it is that the six-month courses end with conclusions," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Working Agency.
The benefits are a variety of: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies could be trained professionals who were increasingly missing in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency should not finance unemployment.
The project also involves the industrial and commercial chamber in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that an internal error and not hacker are blamed for the crash of the website
The shadeful National Security Agency explained late Friday that an error had cheated its public website for several hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the Spionage Agency in an email-provided message.
The problem will be remedyed this evening.
The claim that the failure had been caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evenings, online server travellers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that for some users it is still not possible.
Previously, a NSA speaker had explained to ABC News that the Sensible Internal Network of the Authority was “in no way compromised.”
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have lahmed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
For such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website is collapsed.
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate into the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (No such authority) was now found in the bright light of the public and sees itself in the light of the recent months of its extensive monitoring program in the country and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data that were stolen and published by the deillusioned former NSA staff Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy of the secret service fired initial speculations that the incident today is the result of targeted cyper surgery.
The number of people without a job in October is slightly dropped at 22 to 1.307.
Although the rate of 3.1 percent is better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped more," says Monika Feld-Bauer, Deputy Head of Business Office of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have so far responded to settings.
One reason for this is, according to Field-Bauer, "We have little professionals in the craftsmanship, healthcare and old care".
Yearly periods have also been running jobs for staff in the hotel and restaurants since September.
The winter season begins in mid-December.
The entire background report can be found in the Allgäuer Display of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Wine losses at Bombardier after decline in delivery numbers and orders
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday after having been under pressure by decreasing orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in rail savings.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also published no flight test data for his brand new CSeries plane and did not give any new information about whether the plane could go commercially in accordance with the ambitious schedule in September.
Only three further starts have been followed at the tire flight of the test aircraft until a half months ago, which makes it seem questionable if the test phase expires as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a course rate of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, Analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of "outperform" to "sector perform" in order to ensure that the share has a limited rate potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Why, weaker delivery numbers were widely expected in aircraft, but we are clearly disappointed by the marginal development in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the plane goes ahead.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries plane series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, so far, binding orders for CSeries with 177 moderate, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new Düsen Aircraft are applicable.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The management of the company also assured Analysten and Media on Thursday, the program was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the state of the plane, ground testing and software updates were established.
Every manufacturer plants differently.
We have decided to make a first flight and then hang on a period of revision, whatever we did.
This happens throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it was said by the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts are skeptical whether twelve months after the first customer's younger flight can operate a CSeries plane.
Bombardier explained that it examines the planning of the operation (EIS) and will update it in the next months.
"The slow pace of the flight test – even though they obviously correspond to internal planning – strengthens our view that the operation is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
The turnover decreased slightly and decreased from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, said Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a drop of 57 last year.
The net stocks fell from 83 planes to 26.
The order stock in the air and space reserve was $32.9 billion on September 30th and was therefore unchanged compared to December 31th.
"In the area of aviation and space, the results were in line with our requirements, but the low intake of order and the overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
The turnover in air and space savings fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector increased by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order stock in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on September 30th and was slightly increased compared to December 31th.
The profit margin in the field of transport was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to corporate management, there will be new rules for the fourth quarter.
In the midday trade on Thursday, the bombardier share declined by 8.5 percent and was 4.83 Canadian dollars after also announced that the Google Financial Board will switch to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardiers closest Rivale worldwide, reported a drop of ten percent of the quarter’s profit on Thursday.
USA: Shooting at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport guide told Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security man has also been killed.

US President Barack Obama is constantly informed about the situation, said the speaker of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses indicated that they saw a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told the broadcaster CNN that many people would have been looking for protection in panic.
Travellers would have shouted and wept children.
Under the waiting people, panic was broken out, many would have hidden behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveller of the Los Angeles Times.
A staff of the TSA Security Authority suffered a shot injury at the foot.
The scene was "as in a movie."
After that he had been taken to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen close to a safety control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television images, many healthcars and police cars were being introduced in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were brought to safety from the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special command and a rifle lying on the ground.

The access roads were locked, which, according to CNN, formed long backstep.
Until landing, air transport had been temporarily stopped, it said.
However, several flights were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly used by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is a major airport in the USA.
Cocaine dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must be imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information on sub-world size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpooler Crown Court
A well-known criminal defendant who warned a drug baron from a large police investigation because he feared that his secret drug addiction could be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided sub-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations on its activities in the drug trade, after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The first-class attorney with the nickname “Bash” was arrested in 2011 in his house after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in an earlier drug process.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal of the lawyer's chamber.
The investigations showed that thista regularly consumed drugs of class A after the tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by the police in the context of a large investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were arrested later, after the police secured heroin and cocaine at a number of house throughs in the value of 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could be published.
Today, thista, who works for the Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found and sentenced to the Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week procedure in two accusations of disability.
He admitted the cocaine property at an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that in February 2011 he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and there put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the garbage tone of the lawyer.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly communicated with Ditta, who was at the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park during dinner.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was known that thista was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after the tests of the A-class drugs were discovered in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Thista was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the suspicious dealer because he was his client, and claimed that their discussion was subject to the “annual secret.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken to him.
In the police hearing, he stated that he would be running a office and clients both under his private address and at the workplace for legal matters at home.
In court he became aware that he had called on important actors of drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed what the intermitters knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “A criminal attorney should know better than all others that the law is not broken.”
Thista is accused of the abuse of his position as a criminal defender, as he has taken too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who cares for his lawyer with drugs.
A part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He worked against police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta made his occupational status in charge of this.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out every misbehavior, saying: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I was not, and wanted to share information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do that immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead said of the police in Lancashire: “Mr Ditta has done the step from a criminal defendant to a criminal at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromise and emphasized him for the motives of leading members of organized crime, which commissioned him to collect valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Ditta has deteriorated this confidence and tried to swallow behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a condemnation in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning of criminals and shows that no one can withdraw from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after the conspiracy for heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Five-thirds of others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug abuses.
On his website, Ditta published a field with questions and answers about himself, in which he indicated that his dream job was to be represented as lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and the inequality of opportunities is the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To conclude the celebration from the occasion of his 160-year-old existence, the song ceremony Dunningen is surrounded by two services with the "German Fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which the spectators enthusiastic in spring this year, the song ceremony will enrich two services to the conclusion of the anniversary with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard at the evening fair in St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 p.m. in the church of St. Johannes Baptist in Lackendorf.
The so-called German fair with the original title "Gesänge zum Feier des Heiligen Opfers der Messe", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of the birth.
The fair is listed in the context of the services, as the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the palace group of the musical association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: skepticism softens overlooking confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, Haslach (SE) will change its basic position in the seal care unit.
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the Gremia from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because there is nothing to change in the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is to implement the parish councils as satisfactory as possible.
In the course of the day, it was particularly clear: the skepsis toward the New one softly hesitant but considering confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seelsorgeteam were sufficient.
Regional decan Georg Schmitt explained, on the basis of a presentation, the revised guidelines for seal care units in the Erzdiözese Freiburg.
Afterwards, the SE Haslach, as a church community, will form an organization of public law, which enters into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities so far.
There will be only one common parish council and a foundation council in which the parish office is represented.
At least two selected members are supposed to be represented from each parish, in the six parishes are formed locally so-called municipal teams.
Their task will be in the future to promote church life in the place.
The question of the finances of the individual parish community showed considerable need to talk.
The innovations provide that accumulated assets are retained in the parishes.
On the other hand, liabilities go over to the general community.
In particular, with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then meets all the parishes, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only investments were made in projects that could be handled by the individual parishes alone", Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach related.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes, Barbar Ritter, chaired by the Gremium in the Seel care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they had taken the task "One will, stay five" and had to find that this is not so easy.
The Gremies of the Haslacher Seelcare Unit then responded to the questions concerning the future composition and size of the common parish council as well as the practical work of the municipal teams.
The preparations will be conceived at further meetings and decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies in the next spring.
At the end, parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the seal care unit, which was agreed with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of the City Works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, a four-country Pfullendorf family is added to 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC envelope from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This change is redefined every year in October by the four operators of the large electricity trams.
These amount to the additional costs resulting from the energy turnover, which they can charge through a change over the electricity price.
The townworks Pfullendorf form the last member in this chain.
In his forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher envelope, as Jörg-Arne Bias reported.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We go out of an increase of 1 cent plus x", says Bias, where the number will be near the 2 cents.
Temple on durable red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a sample just doesn't get green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What are you gonna do - if you drive red?
If a affected person waited long enough for a red ample and the crossing is free, he can continue, the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker explains in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "adjusted", which could be differently interpreted from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before a functional disturbance is expected.
However, whoever continues to ride despite red lights must be aware that he is fully blamed for an accident caused by this.
If you wait less than five minutes, you may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of Hamm's Oberlandgericht.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the amples after about three minutes and had to be responsible for a negligent red light violation.
The ample was not defective, but a little later it jumped on green.
A ban was left to him because of the special situation - but not the penalty of money.
The municipal council is delighted with a solid budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipal sackl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not known the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be booked as a full success in this sense.
This was evident in the presentation of the accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million had been out more than EUR 1 million.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also about EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
The surplus is due mainly to higher commercial tax revenue and to the municipality's share of income tax.
The assets budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the 1.5 million euros planned, it was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher increase in the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
As less investments have been made in the financial year 2012 than planned, savings have also been increased.
Overall, the overall reserve could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked him for the good work at Rothmund and her team.
"You don't simply shake such a work out of the sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the municipal councils were clearly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxically, but these good figures could soon be expensive for the citizens.
Through the good financial situation, the municipality was able to abandon high lifts in the past.
However, according to Gerster, the country’s grants had already been reduced in many cases.
There are conditions for these grants from various balance sheets.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying grants must provide certain lifts.
"We need to look at the topic of lifts, as investments we would like to have grants in the coming years," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's history is almost twice as long as that of the feast of herb, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his men's singing association.
Even after 60 years, singing with the now probably more than loved choir still makes him great fun.
In the association Wermter was also active, including 28 years as a member of the Committee.
He received a number of awards for his engagement and his associates: Jörg Koor, Pastoral representative on behalf of the Cäcilien Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, gave him - as the choir is also a church chor - a certificate of the Association and a letter of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singers gave him the document of the German choir association as well as a gravated tinnteller.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival was in habitation: With the MGV Betra, the song crunch salt strings, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the full maringer had loaded a colorful mix of various chores and singing styles, which had the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with voiceful songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Happy, her brothers".
Their honorary singer Hubert Wermter made them a little bit of honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men singing club Betra also sang classic choir songs like "Jachterwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you pass through the valley".
With its mixed choir and female group - the "Impulschor" -, the song crown of salt strings provided the female rate of the festival.
The mixed choir was kidnapped with the nepolitan folk "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" of Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also returned to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home with "What isch of the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the full maringer musical club offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer introduced a casperl theatre and read a few stories that the children spent the afternoon well.

Kenyan press embarrasses on controversial media law
"We are in anxious situation, and we can ask ourselves: 'What does Parliament stop simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?' was the newspaper who considers the draft law as unconstitutional.
"The law is draconic and very punishing and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most recognized independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be prejudiced because it is a prolonged arm of government” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, through the new law, “the media effectively take into a gun” and, on the other hand, The Standard writes, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered“ a heavy stroke, and called the draft as “draconic”.
The adoption of the law is one of a number of measures to strengthen national security in the course of the attacks by armed Islamists on the West Gate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media took the rage of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which the units sent to the crime site supposedly robbed the luxurious shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to hearing with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the preload was withdrawn after a cries of the media.
According to the new law, media houses with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan Schillingen and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded by official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “one penalty could push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on the effects of their description according to Kenya's "living blogosphere".
If the media are to be silent, politicians could do unpunished whatever they want.
"No one will ever experience it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at the nation, who calls the Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
"We leave politicians themselves, lead the country to bankruptcy and return us to the time of the hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislatures have already drawn up public anger in the past.
In May, they agreed to reverse the reductions ordered by the National Responsibility Commission and put their defty salaries of about 532,000 Schilling back into force per month – they are among the highest worldwide.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
In the significance of the city and the football club, the official inauguration celebration for the art grass sports site despite the cold weather and rain did not take place.
A more pleasant celebration was probably all wanted last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
Thus, all those who came without a parachute or couldn't keep such a thing for some reason.
This went to the musicians who embraced the festival act, as did some speaker.
Nass was therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks was given to all former mayor Walter Klumpp, who was committed to the implementation of the project, to the municipal council, the participating companies and association members who entered.
This is especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The equipped pensioners placed 400 square meters of patch stones for the new paths.
This remarkable honorary commitment also honored the Landtags Deputy Karl Rombach.
Further greetings spoke for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South-Badish football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp reminded that constant weather-related influences in the spring and autumn were in such a way that it could not be played.
There were the first considerations to solve the problem 15 years ago, when it was thought of building a third place at the base of the football club or at the Real School at the Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts about the establishment of an art race sports site, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was recorded two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, a cost participation of 100 000 euros for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take the remaining EUR 356,000 to the total cost of EUR 560,000, summarized Klumpp.
The construction start of the 68 times 108 meters of art grass was on June 4th.
During the last three months of construction, 3,000 cubic meters of the earth were carried out, half of which was used for the construction of a Dirt bike line.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with internal and judicial issues.
The responsible working group came together in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is direct democracy, deputy deputy and federal police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Group also wanted to continue their discussions.
This should include the subject of double citizenship, where both sides have contradictory ideas.
The SPD wants to end the force for immigrant children born in Germany to decide for one - the Union refuses a double passport.
In the field of traffic, which is not on the meeting order this Friday, the SPD undermined her no to a car-power required by the CSU.
A Vignette is a "fleet for variety and thus ecologically contraproductive," said the SPD negotiator on the subject of traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
It threatened retirement traffic on roads, which are already accidental points.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be only a first step from the perspective of Pronolds.
"There is the danger that the compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later time," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing fountain wave on the open-light bush

It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Car drivers severely injured in accidents
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was severely injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old out of mourning was on the Kempener Outer Ring on the way to Grefrath at 21.15 a.m.

The VW passat of a 19-year-old was also damaged after the BMW.
A total of about 15000 damages occurred, the police informed.
The train had to be locked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport makes passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In the future, there will no longer be such an interpretation at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
A large part of the speaker's statements are thus missing - the noise level is to be reduced so clearly.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport speaker Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of passages affecting individuals.
In other words, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already abandoning calls.
Due to the failure of these passages - averagely sounding about 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - it is supposed to be more quiet at the airport in the future.
"It has also shown in experience that these individual passages have been relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changing flights or departure times are a bit lower here," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games on the Coldhof
Apart from the brake car pull with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Cold Court from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander Games start at 13.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swim at the Cold Court.
Teams and single fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of tree trunks, hatching, and water tyres.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It's not on the way," explains Organizer Peter Saile.
The strain must be thrown vertically, be overlapped once and then just come to the bed.
This is assessed with most points.
The target accuracy is to be found in the pinch.
From eight meters away, it is thrown to a plock.
The skill and strength of the participants must prove more than 50 meters in water breach.
Time and water in a bottich are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two may participate in the single competition.
The winners of the team and single competition receive prices.
It can be trained from 10 a.m.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the fighters can arrive in the scotch skirt.
But also swabian sweat is allowed.
For "Outfit" the jury gives a few more bonus points.
You can log in up to an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander-Games and the Tractor-Pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has been said at the festival on Saturday.
In the evening, the bubble music friends come at their expense.
At 7:00 p.m., the Biraböhmische Blasmusik from Schömberg has the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fleet Polkas and march.
However, their repertoires include sensible rollers and a satisfactory big band sound.
With this, Heinz Koch will be known as a singing host and black root baron from whiles under the runners.
In Dornhan, he has already occurred at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzunft.
On Sunday, the musical club enters linen to spring, from 14 a.m., the farmer's chapel Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then make the festival sound.
The stopelacker party with DJ Ralf is already open on Friday.
Other program points include the Oldtimer and Schlepper Meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions of companies on agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the maize labyrinth, the craftsman market and sheep shaving.
Specially for children there is a stringelzoo, strohhüpfburg, tractor riding (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
The funding club, the ski club and the tractor friends are organized.
Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegane diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Pirated tofu with plant sand, for example, is a quarter set.
Others call the Vegetarian Association the World Vegan Day on November 1.
The Vegetarian Association of Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World Conference on 1 November:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, allow Joghurt to be replaced by Sojajoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, hafer, amandel or rice milk can be used.
Vegetable peanuts reset conventional snake.
There are also vegetable alternatives for eggs.
For example, half a crushed, mature banane can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a dining spoon mealed linen seeds plus three dining spoons of water are suitable for this purpose.
Locker becomes ponds instead of eggs, for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a dining leaf of food strength and three dining spoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soya yoghurt or silk tofu can meet this purpose.
According to the Vebu, some 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany, i.e. purely planted.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gallery met the American Great Town of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
There was already a fascinating view of the world-known Skyline, which makes a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on the legs, but faithful to the motto "The city doesn't sleep" the day on Times Square was decided.
Despite shutdown, the position of freedom could be reached with a ferry on the second day and at foot.
Afterwards, it went through the financial centre around Wall Street to the Memorial of September 11th.
On the third day, the students from the 373 meters high-level view platform of the Empire State buildings were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city and enjoy the view.
Afterwards it went through the hectic tyres of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience school everyday at Weymouth High School.
This year too, on the name day of the Holy Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marie on the Hulsbergstraße, a Hubertus fair is celebrated.
St. Hubertus was the Sage for a fairly reluctant hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed the Bishop of Lüttich.
The hunting horn blower group of the hunting riders of Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musicates on perforce horns (natural horns in the mood of Es) after old, originally French melodies.
The glasses wear riding clothing, because they are mainly accompanied by riders, horses and dog membranes on sliding hunts.
The festive fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 p.m.
The newly designed impact shines with a new cafe.
One that invites to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to Lexikon, Déjà Vu is called a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the same name café at the scene in the district city of Kleve to the Rhine-Waal University, it is not to remain at the pure Déjà Vu feel.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that for the purpose: to make a real stay not only thoughtful, but to make handfesting always recurrent.
Because it's just fun and just nice.
A look into the inner life at the scene 8 gives a good feeling to the viewer on the ground.
The high-modern but not cool Café ambient looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team spoils the guest with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various coffee or cocktail variants.
For this, there are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already been named before the opening of the smuggling café on the scene as a gastronomy: In Kranenburg, they led the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the plot, the sympathic Café-Liebhaber expects more audience.
Not least also through the university.
"With which we have no specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Instead, the two young students here want to address as well as seniors and all age classes between them.
Propose Café-Liebhaber.
The sympathic holder is behind the coffee genus.
Enjoys the fragrance of hot tumours in the most diverse variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino Trinker.
"That's a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events were already in the bright cafe.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival took place rather outside - the café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringling night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not a pronounced fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event I always address only those who are interested in the special event.
Therefore, events will rather be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the whole normal operation as little as possible."
Should be said: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful surroundings at the pitch in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a gastronomymeile.
For the delight of many clergymen, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the association site of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious collaboration entirely in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate festivity to make honors.
This time, writers Rolf Wagener welcomed the special award "Songers of the Year".
"You have not only written a lot for us, but also turned some rounds for us, our warm thanks for it," said Chores Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir samples through activity bouquets this year went to the chore director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the Honorary Horst Pier-Ribbert, the Chairman himself, and the last year's singer Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Place five noteswart Artur Brückner.
A special thanksgiving the board addressed the team of association wizard Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once more had a menu of the extra class, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" always meets his regular choir samples at 19.45 a.m. in the club's place.
"New singing joyful voices are welcome to us at any time," says Schlotmann.
UN proclaims new targets in combating poverty
From now on, the United Nations starts with the preparation of a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago.
In front of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which started in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the foregoing of "sustainable development goals" which will replace the Millennium Goals in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the evening at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests”.
"I am delighted that the Member States have agreed to initiate a process to meet universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
“These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the Framework for Development after 2015.
I will not be afraid to implement this mandate given by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals which build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball oberligist continues to have a good mood.
That's why Trainer Tomasz Malmon doesn't make any doubts at all.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope we'll finally win again.
"When I don't know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the thirdliga reserve from Fredenbeck has currently not swept out trees, Malmon warns the point finger in advance.
Many players I have trained myself in the A-Jugend.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is to wait if there is still reinforcement from the first one," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison to the past performances.
Before all things in the covering work and in the switching game, it last hapered a great deal.
Also, the use of chances must definitely be improved.
That's why I hope my players finally got their head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of conflicts between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and the first president of Mozambique, to vote for a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an Investment Company.
For fear of the future of the country, it has exchanged its business clothing against a T-shirt with the inscription “We require security” in Portuguese and joined itself at the capital's independence place on Thursday.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports on collapse between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo once was a rebellious movement, which was initially supported by the White Rhodose and later the South African apartheid government in trying to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country is falling back into an adult conflict, but recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
For the rapidly growing economy, the discovery of huge gases in front of the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investments of more than 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA.
The governing Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent collapse by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Hochburg Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government teams attacked Renamo support points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained speakers to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the conflicts and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to reduce concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself to be a loser who “will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement.
He said against the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed little to the settlement of the tensions which have been fired by a number of contradictions this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who collapse the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique experts.
None of them are good in negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who urges election reforms, has already explained that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to make a disturbing movement, to create concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, which was founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM).
Mazanga claims that when the second term of office ends, Guebuza wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidential office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear about the capacity of Renamo, but it has taken accidents on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied reluctantly to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique”, said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, the decreasing progress in the development and a recent deduction wave.
"The people think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted stability.
"No interest in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useable streets again," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “the examples of life,” says a author.
The stories of Thor showed that “brutal force has no chance of clever tricks” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are “to be far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools”, which caused Crossley-Holland to call for an “sorgeous selection” of old-right works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in authors and teachers who are "overly educational" children would be "deactivated". In entertaining stories, the messages would be "subsiduous".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Angel Saxon, who is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as possible.”
The greatest difference may be between an adult author who writes for adults, and a author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to Happy End, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be underestimate, manifested by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob draws again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved his retirement seat in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were alive at the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic of the very short-term scene game.
From arrival on the award of honorary citizenship to his death, film writer and Hansjakobdar writer Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an enthusiastic piece that received a lot of applause under the regime of Cornelia people.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesman through the ten different scenes, explained cohesions and overwhelming time prizes from the youth to the nearing retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, in his courtyard.
And then the play began, in which Alois Krafczyk shined more in his parade role as the great son of the city.
In a stylish way, he presented the two-speaker and "black forests füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause, including his sister Philippine called him welcome.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put into the role of the sister and gave her life in Mimik and Gestik unhappily.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Farmerkapelle played suitablely selected musical pieces and rounded the performance.
In order to award the honourable citizen's dignity, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor, who made his expectation in representation of the former official owner Hättich along with a part of the city council.
Their expectation then made the three kings singers who led Hansjakob to the call: "Aw, as beautiful, there will again be youth reminders of my own three kings' time alive."
With their song "O Jesuin" they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
His criticism of the Church of the Church had expressed Hansjakob the same way as his concerns about the growth of agriculture, the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war.
He found his resting place in the home country, behind his tomb chapel on the fire near Hofstetten.
"An uncalm spirit had finally found his rest and had gone home forever," said it at the end of the scene game.
A lot of applause and many commendable words were available from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of Neckar Riesen grows
The chances of the league stay of the rising Ludwigsburger Bundesliga Basketballers have increased.
Because there should be a wildcard procedure, then there is less competitors for the Neckar Riesen now.
The Basketball project Hamburg Towers abandones an application for a possible back-up site.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said ex-National player Pascal Roller, who has established the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
However, a first breathing was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't deal with the wildcard process, as long as it doesn't confirm that Düsseldorf won't receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Up to 23 May, the Supreme Dusseldorf Baskets may submit further documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic bond accuracy.
However, the license has been denied twice to the Rhine countries.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Nightmill Church turns into the viewpoint
As a contribution from the city to the 150-year-old Existing of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office devotes the last of its public themes this year on Sunday, October 27.
After visiting the nuclear cellar museum, the Haigerlocher's period should be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under the preussian rule.
Crowning endpoint is a visit to the Dining Church.
There, the leaders are told the history of the construction of the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a region through and through Catholics.
Not least, the church also takes the view of the evening meal created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an originally faithful reproduction of the famous Mailänder model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point to the other half-hour tour is at the nuclear cellar museum at 15 o'clock.
Maps are available at the box of the nuclear cellar museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former US secretaryxperte Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal General Prosecutor may ask either written questions or personally address the 30-year-olds in Russia.
This reported the Interfax Agency under appeal to unnamed circles that are familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified by the intergovernmental authorities.
A trip to Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the Agency quoted its source.
Because Germany was allies of the US, Snowden threatened the delivery there, it continued

Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested strongly in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the neck.
The company has several iron in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard uses wind plant logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the warehouse in front of the dike.
Distribute or charge the coal here for need.
In every movement of the envelopes, a scrilled warning noise sounds over the ground.
"The signals serve security and are legally required," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavourable wind, this is widely heard - and there have already been some complaints from people from the city yard.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close agreement with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals with technical measures quieter.
In the future, he set up the open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has something else in front of the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5 meters deepened sunset shape terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can be completed here.
"In this year, we want to knack the 3 million tons brand," says Schrell.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, import coal goes to power stations in the inland.
If the GDF Suez power plant is still on the network, there are about 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year realistic.
The three ship launchers on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayerns Basketballer despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not degrade the huge optimism at the Basketballers of the FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can forbid us to believe to win against the best team of Europe in the past two years," Bilanized Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unhappy 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the title defendant Olympiakos Piräus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
During their first third appearance in the European king class, the Munich sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clarified enough in the crucial phases.
The guests first managed the piece of art to convert a 15-point backstand 13 minutes before the end into a tour before Piräus returned to the game.
"We have incredibly fought back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made reluctant mistakes," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful commercials of the Munich, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two parties against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish tracker Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up Comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started to tell the amount of jokes in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as last at the New York Comedy Festival.
Called into life and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“The majority of these headlines started at Carolines and then became more successful until they were known to be in a club at some point," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event there are events of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as of “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy benefit event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of Comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who participate this year at the festival have become known about more unconventional ways, such as programs on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a sitcom in the cable television (the ironic-slipping fantasy football series "The League" on FXXX) and now has its own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation in both the Saturday Night Live and the "Parks and Recreation", although it is most known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, on racial themes concentrated W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of American comedy.
Among the largest visitors of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed to be a recognized television and film director as well as an inofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television program entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, then he sometimes walks through the street between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is pleased with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN vetomers and Germany.
"After years you have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences of the last years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way, but the nuclear chief dealer was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end, both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill comrades with machete
In Uruguay, two children were insured by the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12 - year - old boys invited her victim to go with them on bird hunting.
With machetes and knives, they armed the 11-year-olds on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reports the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played in a working quarter of football before their apartments.
The body was found in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five - year - old half sister of the younger who had taken them should say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the Tathergang before the police without mentioning an attack against them, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the older one called a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily delivered to a psychiatric youth event.
Container must be in prison
Because of exploitation of human trafficking, salaries, threat, insult and dangerous body injury, the Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years of prison.
The former Federal Army soldier, who worked as a doorstep after two interventions in Afghanistan, gave a consent in the framework of a process agreement.
Thus, in five cases he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on the line after a few weeks against their will.
He was opposed to break with violence and threats.
He retained the revenues of the women, which he purchased for some years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undertook contacts with women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who gave the women, he brought them into various boardelles in the southwest.
There he partially lets them monitor to control their revenues.
In court, the accused first claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychic limitation and thus reflected a limited debt, the 33-year-old gave a comprehensive consent.
The court had no longer to hear any of the damaged women.
According to a Kripo official, after a first advertisement by telephone monitoring measures, at least four other cases of outbuilding human trafficking could be determined.
The absent conversations were characterized by high aggression.
In later hearings, the damaged people would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another Witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots throughout the body, has not made any statements to this day.
It is "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this metier as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He dissolved from these circles and wanted to live a very normal life after the prison," he said.
Oil price continues to up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price has also fallen on Friday, after concerns about a high offer have overshadowed a report that is growing in China's energy-hungling production sector.
The reference raw oil varieties for deliveries in December were dropped in Europe in electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel on late morning.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of raw oil has burdened prices over the past weeks.
On Wednesday, the US Ministry of Energy explained that the United States offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the offer increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there were references to more demand by two reports on an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This suggests a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth had increased to 7.8% in the third quarter after the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from Brent, a reference value for international raw oil, which is also used by American refiners, fell at the ICE Exchange in London around 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the stop-and-frisk directive of the NYPD
On Thursday, a Bundesberufungsgericht in the USA blocked the arrangement of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-frisk program (“Anhalts and Search”) of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. appeal court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision was taken on a call for the city.
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the program was implemented for the halting and questioning of persons.
The city appealed against its assessment and the appropriate remedy measures, including the decision to establish a surveillance body to assist the police in the amendment of its Directive and the appropriate training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the suspension requested on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be disfellowshipped of the case as it had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges by deciding that a judge should avoid the appearance of the party; this was partially justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged, police officers injured the citizens' rights of tens of thousands of people, because in an inappropriate way they take the visibility of black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including reforms in Directives, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program with cameras carried on on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August the city of New York declared himself ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
A oral negotiation for the calling of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics were criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
This type of control has been in different forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an age of 684.330 in 2011, most of which were black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities were filed a complaint that became a collective complaint.
Advantages of changes to the NYPD stop-and-frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and more effective police and influence the way other police presidents use the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the police's morals, but not the crime; nor would money waste and solve the broader problem of a police that is under pressure after the destruction of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-frisk practice that is constitutional, but only reform the nature of the implementation of the controls by the NYPD.
The Happiness of the Dreaming Kamele
Happiness is an oasis that can only reach dreaming camels
With this indication, the first president Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Halfende Hände".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first Chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott in 2004.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and Gynäkologe Henne carried out numerous operations on several trips on site.
During the talks pictures were shown by the inputs on a large canvas, so the guests of the anniversary were able to take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to become active in consulting function at the club.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, an Elendsviertel on the edge of the capital, in the record period of just a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be eliminated in Nagold.
A lot is learned in Africa as a medical person, according to Henne, for example arbitration against Burn-out.
Due to the political distress in the country, it was not possible to do as many travels as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to host here in various areas.
Additionally, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical devices, medications, association materials, hospital beds and brilliants.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered a rich local colonite by telling from Mauritania from Mercedes-Fahrzeugs converted to the mobile cows and signing the experiences of the Stammheimer musicians who traditionally support the club during their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help the Africans in control of a budget by the people.
Feuchtel also stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It's not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking for checking a tip
The former news of the Word Publisher Andy Coulson allegedly introduced “telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation” in trying to confirm a false tip about an affair of Charles Clarke, then.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in Old Bailey that in May 2005 News of the World heard a false rumor that Clarke would have a relationship with his “attractive special consultant” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's Voicemails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called on and left news as the court heard.
“Coulson, who is now publisher of the NotW, is, according to the prosecutor's opinion, no one who stands before the home of people and hopes to attack them on fresh acts, but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reactions," Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three procedures to research stories: telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disagrees, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Gerüche about an affair Clarkes was first attacked by the Feature Redaction of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Don't waste your time, she's with Charles.”
A band with Voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
When the researchers ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following contents: “I have a story that we want to make out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as the former interior minister David Blunkett.
The swearers heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced an affair with a married woman when he was lying with Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks argued to have conspired with others, to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned Reichensteuer, the French football will actually pass through the first strike since 1972.
A simplification meeting is endless.
In the conflict of the Reichensteuer tax, the government and the professional football in France have been maneuvered into a sackgasse after a failure.
President François Hollande received on Thursday in the Pariser Élysée-Palast association and association representatives and also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football of the planned 75% tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies of the country should pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be communicated by the Chief Association of Profi Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The playdays in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between November 29 and December 2 are therefore missing.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to integrate the people early in planning," mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the measures planned to ask questions, to express concerns and to introduce ideas.
Häußler stated: "The final decisions are the members of the municipal council".
The flood water, which cheng met unprepared on May 15, 2009, had been a decisive event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, said Häußler.
A river area investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many buildings as possible is the goal," said Häußler.
Based on the planning of protection against a high-risk water expected every 100 years, according to German weather service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surplus.
This is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had caused significant damage in 2009 in Gechingen, corresponded to a 1000-year-old floodwater.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, where the municipality can expect a total of about 70 percent with national grants.
However, housekeepers pointed out that there is only funding if a general concept is implemented.
The municipality is dependent on the involvement of the citizens.
An overwhelming planning and approval procedure has to be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which has been presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides local measures in the flow of the Irm fleet from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants used the opportunity to address their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no longer dams and pools were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, expert designer of the commissioned engineering office Forest and Corbe from Hillsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needs the interplay of all the proposed measures to achieve the desired target in the sum.
In addition, the most economical solution is to be found, says Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Humility existed in those of the old place who have suffered from an overload of the channel network, even in normal storms.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, housekeepers pointed out that the directives for channel systems are other than that for flood protection and that are not allowed to be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two- to three-year rain events could be forced.
The dimension of the waste water channels would be more than millions.
Serious injury after collision
On the early Friday afternoon, on the Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf, two drivers were severely injured in frontal collapse.
The police sperred the road immediately, but could first say little to the crash.
However, there are several witness statements that should be evaluated.
The 19-year-old steward of a VW Gulf traveled towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collapsed, with the woman so hardly tied in that the firearm needed almost half an hour to free them from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of accidents was first unexplained.
Both disturbances came to nearby hospitals.
The route was locked for about two hours.
You could call him the US Dostojewski.
Philip K. Dick was a God-seeker, a metaphysian, his novels and stories have something serial.
Amazing the relativeity in the outside: the technicating eyes, the baard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to understand with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is a American prophet, who is quite considered something in his own country.
Some titles appeared in the Heyne publisher, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the empire of stunning technical progress, coupled with Paranoia, safety moon and the faith to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had added to his brain.
He's got it, early, that the computers are Divinities.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what a man differs from a machine, the Creator of his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His story inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Morality Report" comes from 1956, which flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
It is developed here the principle of pre-breaking, "pre-crime", which is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world that resembles our horror, Mutants look into the future - and the police take over.
"We collect individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit violence."
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for this we have a criminal camp full of pesudo criminals." They read time streams.
They assume that badness is happening, and prevent the criminal thought being implemented.
Dick's narrative works like the blue break for the anti-terror laws and the radio noise of the NSA.
Antizipation of the attack: Obama's drone philosophie and practice also works.
But Dick's story isn't finished yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more division of power, the military controls everyday life - and what's left by the state.
Then the guard itself is monitored and transposed to a future crime.
The system turns through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It finds its own requirements.
Do not only purchase mistakes and victims, but build on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Spices about Merkel in Russia
The former U.S. secretaryxperte Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. affair for Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Attorney could either ask questions in writing or personally meet the 30-year-olds in Russia, the Interfax Agency reported.
Previously, Hans-Christian Ströbele had met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affairs.
NSA explorations strengthen company paranoia for public surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
Under the direction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism Anti-Terrorism (BVT) of the German Interior Secret Service, he should photograph the roof of the US Outside Post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the USA and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the US did not use any possibilities of foreign spying to steal the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profit.
But since Edward Snowden, who became a Whistleblower, has started publishing his filling horn to US surveillance secrets, European governments and heads of business are no longer sure whether they can speak to the director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has pioneered the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the company's paranoia has brought to a new maximum due to state surveillance.
The Fass to Overrun led to the uncover that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was wounded, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can get to the visor, then business managements are certainly also potential goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now posed a nearly as high risk as China, when it comes to industrial spying and data theft, such an survey published by the consultant company EY in July.
However, in the documents transmitted by Snowden, there has not been any evidence that the US has passed the operating secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet possibilities and should reduce their dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical in this regard.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them back...
"This does not work so," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything, up to the IT industry.
Nevertheless, reach and technical refinement of the US spionage authorities discovered by the snowdevelopment have shocked companies who had previously seen the largest spying risk in China.
A major change in cloud computing is taking place because European heads of business are now more aware that data stored in the US are subject to the law there and are potentially threatened.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, after the revealing of the US data mining activities with prism, about ten percent of the members not in the United States were planning to use a U.S. provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers who have not yet existed a year ago – it says: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that these are physically staying in this legal area?”
Many German managers believe that the recent reports just confirm what they knew, in any case, that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be monitored at any price.
That economic spionage takes place is not surprised.
That's always the case.
"It has been a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Chemicals Company BASF.
The Americans are pioneering us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business management usually does not give rise to the counteractive measures that you have taken, because that gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been aware that taking a free USB stick on a fair or the unwavered lag of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, Executive Board member at Autohersteller Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when they travel abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain attackable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources in order to effectively protect operating secrets from unauthorized access," warns BVT in a report.
The US warns their own companies against economic spying by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February France, Russia and Israel, the US National Intelligence Estimates were assigned to the rank of two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from hacking.
A member of the board of a German Blue-Chip company agreed when it comes to economic spying, then “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the DCRL interior service, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The secret services know very accurately that even when all countries work together in the fight against terror, they pioneer their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe answers wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery journey that man can do," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration succeeded, now gave a special trade fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Deputy were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has resumed entry.
This starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In front, the frequent roasted and embroidered clothing are closed, often with a veil, on the back they go down and often end in a sleeve.
However, the spirits are separated, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Clothesmüller.
With men, the suit with the west and Plastron dominates, but it can also be chosen cream-coloured or brown combinations.
The choice of the local is important, it was explained.
Jewelless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain pointed to its own offer in the remise.
Anyone who wants to go ahead with the kiss then has an offer for Uwe Link.
"Buts are also popular for boys' divorces," he says.
Romance is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding images.
More and more in fashion, the "After-Wedding-Photo" - thus recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothing, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower Arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can enjoy guests stylishly.
Do not forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable festival.
Dog Friends Successful
For a repeated time, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful on a Rally Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dogs, he scored 94 points in the Class Beginner and secured the fifth place, and with Marley, 15 months old, he brought it to place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in class 1, took the critical views of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled ring matt in the high school tour hall, are convinced that her son was murdered, the lawyer of the family declared on Thursday.
On January 11th, Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found in a upright matt that stood behind the tribune in the school turn hall.
Sheriff's sheriff of Lowndes County investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the family of 17-year-olds doubted.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff had concluded.
"They believe that every logic is infringed against the laws of physics as well as against the healthy human mind," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to learn and returned in the body bag," he commented.
U.S. State Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation to the death of Johnson, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This explains Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they also lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that Johnson had died from the consequences of a 'position-related displacement'.
A second autopsy, however, caused another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added, if there are sufficient evidence of a criminal or civilian investigation to death Johnsons, he will order the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriffs authority was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a court in the south of Georgia ordered that the authorities should release all surveillance videos that the intermitters have reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped that the video recordings showed how he died.
CDC publishes allergy directives for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such directives that the US Government has issued, as the number of children with food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that are intended to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and employees and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin predominantly – the auto-injection of the epiPen brand is most commonly used – to meet potentially fatal hypersensitivity reactions.
The legislators in the Federal States have recently changed the rules so that schools can easily keep Epinephrin prevail.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pushing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it" or "My tongue shrinks".
Parents of intersexual children can choose 'human sex'
Germany is the first European nation, in which a third gender is recognized for children born with unclear genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned steady male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to explain sex for such children but can “undetermined” or “not determined” on birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take pressure from parents so that they do not have to make overlapsed decisions in relation to operations for gender allocation in newborns, and fight discrimination of intersexual people.
According to BBC, an intersexual person said years later: “I am neither man nor woman.”
I'm staying the flicking work created by doctors, mugged and filled with scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children is not born every year as a boy or as a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that is covered by the diagnosis “Sexual Difference Disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, chimney glands (eyerts or honeys) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend to use the best available information on sexual allocation if a provision is not possible and not to wait for the child's psychological and physical development before, if any, decide for surgery.
New York Psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialized in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law “knocks for a good thing.”
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Many people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not have this," he said.
One could make a sexual assignment without surgery and then wait for the development of identity.
The scientific data on how a child develops its sexual identity at all are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons because their status is not sexually related, but is conditional on their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hairing, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genitalia or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Unlike the gender image, boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate on official documents male, female or third sex.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognised as the world's first “genderless” person after a court had granted the lifelong maintenance of a “undefined” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German statements will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, said the Ministry of Interior.
In neighbouring France, sex topics are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French Members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the “Gender Theory” should be removed from school books.
The US-American website Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law, explaining: “If the world is distorted into a new state, where sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to baby zone that she find it better when babies are assigned to a gender at birth.
"The parent is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your own child," she said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born both with male and female sex were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek God, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine viewed the sex as something that could be eliminated and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted, after now knowing how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feels when it grows with the sex assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency” said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of the treatment of children with non-unclear genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University, who believes that the sex is formable.
He expressed the term “sexual identity” and argued social and environmental concerns – as the parents trained a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and practised whether a person is considered male or female.
However, in a case known under the title “John/Joan” from 1966, his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a malicious circumcision to cast the child completely and to remove his dogs and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation, but what he was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to male sex and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the Internet, survivors of these gender operations have come to the public, which are “not happy with the result”.
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomen, but two-large genitalia.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and dogs were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD by which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of genitalia.
After learning the truth, he changed to male identity, received testosterone injections and let his breasts be removed.
The surgery has made it infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the Law Advocates for Informed Choice in California, ensures that the German law could “comfort to stamp and stigmatize”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign to the child a ‘undefined’," she explained.
We are afraid that favours interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait for it.
But yet we do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law, because “adults allow recognition as a third gender”.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex," she said.
The German law concerns the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they are grown, they can decide on their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a pittsburg chest radiologin who has a daughter with a sexual distortion and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law “compulsory” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomen, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistence.
Due to the recipe orderfect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no eggs.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff in the child psychiatrie.
Although infertile, she hopes to get a child through adoption or a body mother.
"The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make overlapping decisions," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to make different tests and to clarify things and thus give them time before they write "manual" or "womanly".
In this way, everything is okay – you're getting the child big and loved it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parent's happiness.
And you don't have to do a surgery that can no longer be reversed.
"This involves the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are experiencing because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the gender that fits better to him – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girls by shot from car
Unknown when shooting out of a car, a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt was injured.
The perpetrators probably fired on Thursday evening in Genthin with an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
That told the police in Burg.
The girl was easily injured on the left wade.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot on a bus stop.
Cracked a disc.
Then they took it.
The criminal police found it on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection can look back to Kempten on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called for only two children to be egg-shaped, who threw them against home facades.
Since the house owners recognized this in time and removed the egg residues at the same time, there should be no cause of damage.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller have probably been burned in the city area, but also here there has not been any damage.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was included with clothing and his cycling blends were evacuated.
Until the police arrive, however, the man found his cycling blinds again in the immediate vicinity of all, which the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries is dreaming.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only minutes of public transport.
"You hope they're not afraid of spiders?", Waltraud Ries asks and shows a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern that at age, the many stairs to the house and in the apartment no longer can handle, she explains.
In addition: Since a meniskus operation, the mid-fiftyer has had to learn on his own body what it means to move with disabilities from floor to floor.
Recently, a book of her has just appeared on the subject 'Happy living in age - Which living form is the best for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on at the age," she starts to tell.
When she moved to the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, at mid-50, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is among the few people who are at all talking about the subject 'woning in age'.
Most of them are pushing it as long as it goes.
"I'm always getting old only the others," she says smilingly.
Only when the suffering pressure is really big, you think.
"Then it can be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in the age.
"Which form of living, however, is always a individual decision," she explains.
I do not have a solution for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or the Bretagne should always consider that he could also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language of the country, one can also be in the Dolce Vita,' the author of the book gives you an opportunity to consider foreigners.
Among their models are classical care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited pensioner WG.
At age, everyone has his tricks and Mackens.
'For me, though, wouldn't be a living community,' she meant with an eyedrinker.
Not even as in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"In the age you just need your backing rooms," says Ries.
However, the bookwriter does not want to exclude the functioning of an elderly living community.
But this must be different from the classical student WG.
And sometimes one just wants his rest,' she believes.
With this view, at least it is not alone in the capital of the country.
'The majority of old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home for as long as it goes' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital of the country.
Your service advises people about the subject 'become older'.
For this reason, just older people would often also purchase discomforts and restrictions, only to stay in their habitual environment, that is also the experience of the Foundation of Good Tests.
Today there are many opportunities to make the house or the apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all who are dealing with the old-right reconstruction of their home or home, be thoroughly informed and not commissioning the first craftsman.
Today, there is also for the old-level reconstruction specialists.
Even in the rental apartment, this can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior architect clarifies.
But not always the existing apartment can be redesigned old-right and thus accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairway within the apartment, the road also pampered with stairs to the door of the apartment would be the much larger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she looks more than before the spider at her apartment door.
USA wants to continue to pursue Snowden criminal law
The US has not changed their attitude to former US secret staff Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of having unauthorizedly transmitted secret information.
Therefore, he had to set up a criminal procedure in the USA, said the spokesman of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements of Snowden would also not change.
Previously, German Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to avoid threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that the statements of a parliamentarian and not the statements of a German government member were about.
Secret Service Dilver Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation cleared.
This has made clear to the former NSA worker sought by the USA in a letter not addressed, published by the Green Politist Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, Bundestag and General Bundesanwalt.
The letter shall be replaced by the following:
To the Responsibles
I was asked to write you about your mass monitoring investigation.
I was named Edward Joseph Snowden and was employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became a witness of systematic violations of my government, which caused me from moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent hat, which forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently exiling and enjoy temporary asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political action, both in the USA and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have assessed the revealing of a system of comprehensive surveillance that is not guilty of accountability as a public service.
These spionage revealings led many proposals to new laws and directives aimed at the former misuse of public trust.
The benefit for society from these findings is increasingly clear, while the risks acquired were clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat Dissens as a treacherous breakthrough and strives to criminalize and defend political expression.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that with the support of the international community, the United States government will take this detrimental attitude.
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been educated, I will be able to participate in the responsible information on media statements, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and legally.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for their efforts to maintain the international law that protects us all.

Children's garden has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
The sale was agreed by the municipal council at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "adjusted" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," says Maier.
The budget was 100 000 euros.
It is still not clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
To the mayor it is right that winterlingen have given responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and therefore no longer have to come up for the entertainment of the house, as to heat, look for the garden and clean up the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The musical club Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the Hammer guesthouse.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the tactstock at 19.30 a.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Some 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich's musicians.
The Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the musical pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully handle the first musical hock.
Report: Obama campaign considered to replace bids with Hillary Clinton
The closest consultants of President Barack Obama have thought in secret to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign by Hillary Clinton, according to New York Times.
The unveilment is the most notable surprise of the long - expected work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times is a copy of the next book, and she reported on Thursday evening that the president's top consultants had conducted "great group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out whether it would be better for Obama's dwindling hope of re-electing if he drops bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and of the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect on the survey values to exchange former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice Presidents.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the closest consultant of the president – including Daley, the former campaign leader Obamas, Jim Messina, and the former leading consultant of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the thought of the change.
"Double Down" claims that Daley was at the top of the efforts to exchange bids despite their "sense, personal circumstances" before finally decided to make such a draw after the data showed that the Candidate Clintons would "not significantly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace bids with Clinton.
"I expressed a number of things that should be considered, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the president had horrible survey values at that time, so we thought: "For God's will, what do we do?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as "provided care", Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign, considerable effort had been made to re-elect, to find out whether such a train paid for the electoral hours.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent for surveys and focus groups if you do not seriously think about something," said Martin at AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about a exchange.
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his former boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe that the President was “conscious of the possible change”, the former chief of the staff admitted that Obama had known of it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political consents would have reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thinks Obama knew nothing about the investigations about whether to let bids fall in the elections.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
What's going on with my email?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the e-mail e-mail in the drafting of the Internet service similar to that of the conventional mail technically implemented the letter secret?
The conception of early Internet services focused on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not respect the creation of a stable foundation for a hearing-protected exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds to an open mail card rather than to a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two then directly connected?
In the first step, the e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run via some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will conventional emails be read through the network on their way?
Most mails are read several times by software robots.
The provider of the sender usually checks whether the mail is carrying out an injurious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
Also, the providers check whether it is a harsh and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or removed into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holiday trip, Google can display related links to holiday offers.
Also, do unknown people read the emails?
The probability that unauthorized people read an e-mail is extremely low.
But theoretically it is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to capture or note e-mails.
These are possible illegal exaggerations.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be encrypted effectively for parsing.
With a high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to recognise who has communicated with who.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the mostly privately used post offices.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had last fallen, GMail was able to make it clear by Google.
Mother in the forest sharpened and rented
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg slept a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to pay their pension and nursing money.
In order to continue paying pensions and nursing money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother after investigations by the police in the forest.
At first, he deceived the death of the 89-year-olds, then he removed the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
Accordingly, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time, the need for the nursing mother was no longer required.
The pensioner told the intermediary that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to detect.
They found out that they had lived in a shared apartment for over 15 years and he had last been caring for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, an obduction did not give any evidence of capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first shining ice – using quallen.
Charlie Francis made use of the fluorescent properties of the sea animals and created a shining leak.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on quallen and convinced Chinese scientists to produce the shiny protein artificially.
The ice cream responds when eating with the tongue, which raises the pH value in the protein and triggers the luminaire.
Chris explains that the eating ice reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shine – the more you leak, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value increases and the ice illuminates.
We tested it in the last months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because the quallen illuminator is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it's delicious for that.
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his newest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says: “I would like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is impossible on and for itself because of the light breaking caused by the ice crystals, which consists of ice cream; but I suppose we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a qualle that is artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League after six days of play.
Now it comes for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts new for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," Ehlers feels optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has its complete framework available.
Daverden too, like we're going to play a pace game.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
Firstly, however, it is important to increase in coverage, which has last left everything other than a safe impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to move in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this, the A-Jugendly Joos Windsuß celebrates his seasonal debut with double play law at the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen.
Anyone who's not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was young, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween-Muffel.
In the last two years, I haven't declared myself willing to distribute my apartment from sweets, and I'm sure I'm not going to do it this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be accurate – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion for sweeteners, costumes and decorations, according to the American association of retailers (NRF).
One thing I'll be happy to each Halloween again is the trend values.
The costumes will represent about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion US dollars, according to the NRF.
This year, the last cry is excited uninhabited objects.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothing, they can now also embrace seductive food such as pizza, hamburger or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of Zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk-World-Männer will create it in the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are Zombies, Batman, Pirates and Hexen.
I suppose it's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and weren't alone to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their pets, says the NRF.
These are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As for sweets, we're not clever.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate gels, lushes, bonuses and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Ministry of Commerce, who pass through the quarters with the word "sweet or saurs".
In fact, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't pretend – eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugary Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweetwaren Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion maize grains.
It's a mystery that I haven't been able to solve.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses in which it spucks.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized houses in the United States that make $500 million redemption, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pluck into the hole and then put the friends on Facebook, where you don't get rid of them again, and then one of the type on which one stands leaves a comment like “net face print”.
But let's finally come to the shorts.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Kurbis when we were children, and the cutting of a turbis lattice is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we made from little.
Fortunately, the “Baby in the Kürbis” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up to snatch the shortby and not to sit in it.
This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for shortages, says the US Census Bureau.
The turbolic leaven, which slowly rotates in the pregnant garden, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of shortages were harvested this year.
If you want to do the right points, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and cut a little chicken out of their 921 kilos heavy shortage.
Residential fire in Helmbrechts: rescue forces mountains demolished body
The firearm had to go out in Helmbrechts on late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night to Friday.
The rescue forces are stolen from the house.
In a fire in Helmbrechts, rescue forces have found a collared body in a three - family house.
Whether a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman of the police in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firearm arrived, the flames already hit out of a window.
The forces went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned completely.
The whole ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents weren't at home during the fire, the police speaker continued.
The building is no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not at first clear.
Germany's largest German church has launched an offensive to recruit for the pastor's profession.
Background is a possible lack of pastors: The Evangelical-Lutherian Landeskirche Hannover expects that the number of their currently around 1,800 pastors and pastors will half up to 2030.
For young people today, the job is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to determine the working and daily course itself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche first commissioned a pastor in a full position to enthusiasticize young people for theology study.
At present, less and less young people decide to study theology after the abitur.
Burfien reiterates this to the process of decirchification: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The occupation was characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my calendar and can place my priorities where it is important for me.
Pastors could be very close to humans as an elevator.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
Surely more is paid in the free economy, but theologians have a safe employer.
This is true to the young people today, who are not only about career, but about a senseful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retireing per year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study start their vicariate.
In thinly populated areas such as resin, emsland, or Wendland, it could be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and invite for this, among other things, prominents who have studied theology.
The theology study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become the Federal President.
Land Rover Rally series announced
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free-speaking system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with care of Bowler work mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people who are looking for tension and adventures as well as for a accessible way to world class events.
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare new ones for the stratas and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge-Wagen – that becomes a entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day at the Defender Challenge in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Called firearms to rescue a dog that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock spring in a stone break
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the stone break in her miserable situation
Firemen sailed off on rock wall and saved the dog before the safe death
The firearm succeeded in bringing a dog into safety, which was stuck on a 15 meters high jump in a rock wall.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had passed away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the stone breeze in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and thank him for the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dogs and published calls for help in social networks when she had escaped the stone break after the small traffic accident.
About 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the rocky Ruby on the 15 meters high paragraph in the stone break.
The technical rescue team of Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the place and sailed down to the rescue of Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her salvation – she was as frozen as stiff.
But now she's fine.
She then eated a few dogs.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a great luck.”
It was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was introduced to the veterinarian, but it did not detect anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “There was anxious to see rescue.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the poor.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too big and it would be broken together, it would probably be crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are simply so grateful and everyone of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he never made Katy Perry when she was 18 years old.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer to Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the old dryer in the evening, and that “he was drunk me when I was 18”.
She added: “It's been a long time ago and he was very nice to me.”
In an explanation, a representative Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “reasoned categorically that he had ever tried to approach Katy Perry”.
The representative added: "Perhaps it has confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album “Prisce” landed at Anhieb on place 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European defense gives the Schots the choice
A new day, a new horror story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a precondition for EU membership.
This delivers the keyword for stories about passing controls in Berwick and a border secured with stachel wire along the Hadrian wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this, as expected, did not play a role in the headlines.
Nor has nobody mentioned that the EU Member States often correct their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-respect for Brussels would be just a small consent for what one really wants from the Scottish.
So, actually, no story.
And one who has come so in the years that she already resembles a fossil: the first time I have heard the "independence means passing control" units at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repeating of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke against that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for Europe's unification after the war has come to an end.
With the Eurocrisis, the Europe project has officially died.
Overall in the EU, parties win on ground that are opposed to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptian Party was able to forge almost five million votes in the Federal Day election in September and thus effectively distribute the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Due to the strict savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is required by holding the common currency, many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has set its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to leave.
Without the possibility of devaluating the local currency, Southern Europe will be recovered with a built-in disadvantage to Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public expenditure – motivated by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind the current problems of Etat and Currency.
As a result of Brussels 'green' energy directives – a code for the subsidie of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays the double for electricity and the fourfold for gas compared with the United States.
This is a damaging cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All wages in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American pipe gas.
As a result, a revolt raises, especially in France, the EU's former Cheerleader.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which you could hold Germany in chess and lift Paris at the height of the eye with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe’s own economic policy, with which the affected French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pens, a right-looking EU-friend Front National, has just won a decisive reconciliation, thus referring to the governing socialists in place three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically make advantages for the left.
What makes Le Pen with her newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to smear an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are well cut off in these elections – and that is very well possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to go beyond: in not all too much future, the growing yield against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the 'Europe of (souvereign) nations', which has favored General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distant itself from this project in the hope of melting into the US.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific area indicates that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where's Scotland staying with all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including Berlin and Brussels, what they can say.
I suppose Scotland could drive very well in a looser European association if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-founded Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider it to be the same to Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkablely – the most successful political movement against spare policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and) reductions which the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Life Dem Coalition had to be responsible.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for independence now, only to be forced by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Getting grown faster
Afro-American and hispanese girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white agemates, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean pubertate directly
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend of early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and shame at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually this is not a sign that now quickly enters puberteit," explained Kaplowitz.
Obviously displays of development, such as growing breasts, shame and axle hair, as well as body smell, appear in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (at the first rule bleeding) over the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Fresh Pubertät bei Mädchen: The essential counselor for dealing with this often occurring problem".
Time is the most precise test as the puberty progresses.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is true that if the breast increase is accompanied by an increase in growth before an age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a child doctor can monitor closely.
In faster advances, tests may be indicated by an endikronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defense of another result: premature ageing of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are oriented at the age of the child, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant to medication, but he admits: “The suppression of puberty can reduce behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, to be unlike her ages.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had received her days with ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She was afraid and excited from school to home because she was the first in her friends' circle.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there are no clear evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be cause.
Boys come to puberty like girls earlier.
Caplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of fattening.
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine, making a link between body fat and entry into the puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, Afro-American and hispanese girls tend to reach puberteit rather than their white agemates.
There are different explanations.
Global seems to be an early puberty influenced by all possible things, from economic conditions across the climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys already grow face and shame hair, the trend to a full-end earlier puberty is not as profound as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and shame hair is widespread even in babies and infants.
"We need to be careful as we identify the true beginning of the puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician how to talk to their child.
"This can mean that you have to talk earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay quiet, the child normally responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even when it happens earlier than it is thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders about seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute about the width of seats in the tourist class at long distance flights, which indicates the sound for a bitter collapse on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is around the seat width, which passengers are offered in long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most trying to make airlines, but this proven space represents the key to the efficiency claims in the latest airplanes of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week Airbus demanded an industry standard that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. Archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide that.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance flights and expect record contracts from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the plane is formed – in particular whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the given economic results to provide the new “Mini-Jumbo” design.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" holds 406 people at seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide and allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aeroplane engineers often share hovers about technical details using advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new adventure war, showing money providers a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant, and the title, "Will you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-term flights in seats that are closer than regional Turbo-Props," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In view of changing diet habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health.
According to American health statistics, the taille range of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival is a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body range of the freshly baptized "Jet set" was narrower.
Airbus said that investigations that proved that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increased the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus’s figures with the seating measures and says that it does not stand to decide in the measure of manufacturers how airlines make the balance between flight rates and establishment.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
"It is really about to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," explains Kent Craver von Boeing's flight cabin expert.
They don't want us to dictate them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more free of elbows, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly a subject that can affect the transactions.
Behind the conflict, a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars by listing prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
Reuters reported for the first time in July that the seat layout is the driving force behind the conflict with the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long track designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements Boeings on the results depend partly on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for machinery currently used with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore quetting more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s suggested that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper flight rates.
"Aighteen inches of seats would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin facility, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world travellers of jet sellers even carry a tape to measure the establishment in competition.
Even if they are awarding the comfort, all manufacturers also offer Jets with high-competitive design for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but according to its own statement no one has sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of the adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats for some jets on the slopes.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to be poured, but could detract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the garaus
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking.
One single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a life from carbon addiction.
Prior to human tests, further attempts are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.
"We are very hoping that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine desire is stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified in such a way that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus infects the liver cells selectively, which then produce a constant current of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thus a smoker does not experience a nicotine height.
In trials vaccinated mice administered nicotine contributed their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination would have taken an outtime, the researchers explained that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans could be given children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“They know, when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure because of the vaccine, and that helps them to deter the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but at the same time warned that further research was necessary.
Tripodi contested to be influenced by Obeid
Against the former Minister of the Labour Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a investigation is initiated by the State Corruption Supervisor.
The former NSW minister argued that it had changed the rules on Maritim sensation at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, which had concealed participation in three lands in the state controlled.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) expanded its investigations on whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of State in this regard, to extend cargo contracts on the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe, without having to be tendered after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is determined because of the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's concealed interest in the lands after Tripodis had said earlier deputy baref Lynne Ashpole accordingly on Thursday.
In years of discussion that started in 2005, the government had threatened public tenders for the Pacht Contracts.
The guards were opposed and wanted to run longer.
In 2009, the cargo contracts were extended for companies on the Circular Quay, which spent $2.5 million each year on the Obeids, without a public invitation to tender.
Tripodi, who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, originally spoke for public tenders.
However, he refused to have made changes to Obeid's requests, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had forced to transform the government's cargo arrangements.
One of the ICAC's telephone subscriptions showed discussions from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading official who had been switched to the Harbour Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Is the subject of the drafting of commercial dispatch schemes in this telephone conversation?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitively not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighting aircraft attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a destination in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursdaynight, a leading government agent confirmed Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the goal was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria this year.
Foreign workers with 457-Visa could be subject to "eightness test"
The government considers an "reality test" for foreign workers with 457 visas in the framework of extended measures.
If the test is introduced, it will be used via a criterion that will prevent the 457 to be used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the accession of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a discussion proposal was published by the government after Maxine McKew, former members of the Labor Party, who had condemned the government’s comments on foreign workers because they could be insulted by the neighbors of Australia.
“Specific statements such as ‘externals are supposed to be positioning behind’ and ‘Australians first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions called for a protected labour market," she said to Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to take an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures once proposed by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who left yesterday to talk about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still considered.
If the "reality criteria" are accepted, a person applying to a visa may be examined in the case of "the application in the cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking or personally linked".
Companies could also be obliged to take account of the number of 457 fishermen after, in the past, companies who wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally set up hundreds.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old asylumant probably died in a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 iron railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England be achieved at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “will bring Britain closer”.
The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway connection between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of the high-speed road between London and North England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, in conversation with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings together Britain and its cities closer.”
We go ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are faced with a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: “The present announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael urged to "definitely understand" for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection is the potential of enormous economic advantages for Scotland, but at the same time, the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK.”
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, which creates advantages for everyone and complements the connection of Glasgow-Edinburgh, which already plans the Scottish government.
I am looking forward to examining the investigation report with the British Ministers next year and agreeing together on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain provisionally applicable in Australia
Australian passengers must continue to disable tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the US to illuminate the regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers on their devices can read, see or play e-books during critical flight phases, if they are in "Flugmodus".
During the large part of the flight, passengers are already allowed, but many people find it angry that they cannot read their e-books when they start and land.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the US airlines to do a lot of work, but do not follow immediate plans to amend their rules.
CASA also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft," it has been explained.
The subject is subject to provisions for which airlines must maintain safety at any time and passengers must comply with the safety instructions given by cabin personnel.
Virgin has already led to flights with the CASA talks about an extension of the use of his Wi-Fi maintenance system and explains that one is open for changes, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer (driven entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas said that you will remain with the current rules until more.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices should not be used when starting and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules shall apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different effect in US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disturbances through mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs as well as customer education.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can permit passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book laser devices and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases in bad view, the crew will tell the passengers to disable the devices while landing.
The group also recommended to stew harder devices safely under the seat or in the compartments over the seats when starting and landing.
In front of the district tour against Schalke, fellow BVB pendant with light missiles had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Football League against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an uncommon, almost Spensical Acoustic, which offered the viewer until shortly before the attack of the Federal League game between the German Vice Chairman Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were listening with their songs.
On the other hand, the southern tribune, where the faithfulest of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented exceptionally silent: no songs, no battle calls.
The podest of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common fire, remained unsettled.
And at the front of the tribune, a large flag with a record "Section of Stadion prohibition" was wounded lonely.
Only as Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, a short-term jubel burned up.
When his teammates followed, there were loud singing and hurting scarfs - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribunal there was nothing.
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again summoned the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory about Arsenal, extension of the contract by trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for celebrations.
Only five minutes before the capo cloaked his podest - and the up to then straight with hands tangible tension escaped in a loud cry, when Dickel as usual asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
The last thing was like always the southern tribute on the row - and finally here was again as usual as the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, when the loud call "Derbysieger stands up" came with an appetite from the south tribune, everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a response to the events of the past days.
Immediately before districtby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the coached BVB hangers had fired light missiles into the viewers' entrances and place - and almost hit Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was late for the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and believed what was Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive insects for the entire ultramove," announced the BVB boss on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke undermined the ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbid this," he explained.
We can't give up the zero tolerance policy in matters of pyrotechnology.
In addition, the ultras have been shown different ways of punishment - until Tuesday these have now time to decide for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction by the end of the next week.
"That's going to be instinctive," assured Watzke.

Pfandhäuser trees in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
In a pand house at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden armreif, a ring and a pair of earrings to be able to pay the school fees of their daughters.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1.730 euros) every month as a administrative employee and also worked for her husband, the monthly family income did not reach out, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of households increases – is so large that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, this week became the third pedestrian house listed on the singapurian stock exchange.
The donation of jewelry is not only a faster way to get money – 1.300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loan.
Typically, pedal houses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest of 17 percent, which is only about 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pedal houses offer the advantage that no review of creditworthiness or income evidence is required, so loans can be made faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to pand houses after families feel the pressure by increasing cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a looser financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium-sized income are looking for pedal houses to compensate for the difference in the disturbing economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly by increasing mortgage, referred to as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the Agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent still in 2008.
Economics are also concerned with the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday the data showed an ongoing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the final effect, this means that in view of increasing costs, people will try to complement their income in the medium to lower segment (the income scale) wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical ceilings in gold prices over the last two years have strengthened the trend to sponsor personal items, as people use the opportunity to convert the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the sponsored objects are in the 200 pand houses of the city state of Gold.
People say: “The gold prize looks good, let us be spoiled with gold chains and get back next month.”
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, EasyMoney, has experienced 20% growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pedestrian business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branches in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only into the neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yes Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this by 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it took this week with the stock exchange course in Singapore.
While some creditors had come into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Ja explains that penetration houses not only boil more favourable interest than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
'Customs borrow objects they already own, and the liquidity of personal assets does not increase the budgetary shift', she explains.
The postal loan business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secure financing.
Neither are all people who use pound loans in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore are also coming to the branches of ValueMax to sponsor gold bars and Rolex doors, for which they get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
We come to customers from every social shift.
"These are wealthy persons who are lending something for a business or investment in the short term, or small enterprises that have to bridge close-ups in the cash flow," says yes.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service enthüller Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany learn the ever more brilliant NSA affairs.
According to the Green-Bundestag Deputy Minister Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-Geheimdienstmitarbeiter would express in a German prosecutorship or before an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government is based on the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth would take "unconspicuous measures" to eliminate a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island State, a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian colleague Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has launched an emergency rescue package which, in our opinion, concerns the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325-million dollar package comprises 31 million dollars of emergency aid for election services.
By further 2600 operations, including orthopedic interventions and treatments for grey stars, residues are intended to be removed.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care for stationary stays, professional training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas that clinic workers have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister stood on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian Government.
The state must maintain the current level of financing in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-country Commission is set up and is intended to ensure that the state provides health services as effective and efficient as possible.
According to Wilkie today, the $325 million would only benefit little if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course”.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aids will make a great contribution to taking the public health system of the state from the worries list," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely compensate for recent cuts.
But the health spokesperson of the opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is just a "plaster solution".
"We are therefore in the situation today because the laboratories government has deducted $430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government almost half a billion dollars gets out of the system and puts in the Commonwealth 300 million and then do as if the good news were.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package was issued for additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important bodies for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas counition, the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while there were serious collapse in the north of the country near one of the locations where consumingly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had already been killed three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, which the Damascus organization established in The Hague in order to destroy or make all the equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid 2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
It believes that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including senfgas and the sensible gas of Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when battles took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, the experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses here, as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in Britain reported.
The activist group, who persecuted the number of deaths via a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people died.
There are 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the Army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 are government-friendly fighters and 187 Libanese Hisbollah miles.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5.375 fighters of opposition, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100.000.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict forced about two million people to escape from the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said that on Thursday there were losses on both sides, but didn't call any details.
The fighting underlines the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arms a race against the time in the midst of a tremendous civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team “is not convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities referred to by Syria and has experienced its destruction.”
That is why no further inspection activities are currently planned.
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of the verifications and visited 21 out of 23 of Damascus' sites.
Because of security concerns, the visit of two institutions was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two locations had been “returned ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme there had been transferred to other inspected bodies.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that couldn't visit the OPCW inspectors.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I draw the hat from the braveness and courage that you all have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organization in an OPCW comment.
For three years now, the mostly sunnic Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and their security forces, many members of the Alawites, a breakdown of Shii's Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the Observatory Group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he explained.
Anger on Judgment for Bomb Legs of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 at the bombing attack in Bali responded angry with the judgment for the last of the founder who was put to court, since Umar Patek had to be permanently shot.
Patek, who was almost ten years away as one of the most sought persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in the construction of explosives for the bomb attack yesterday.
He could be released after 15 years of penalty.
The 45-year-old was found to be guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A debt claim was also made in a series of terrorism-related accusations, which included a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Holy Night in 2000.
The prosecutor had demanded a life-long penalty, even if it could have applied the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation, was also referred to as a master's bomber.
The decision has awakened painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin stewards Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-sworns almost ten years ago.
With tears she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him before a shooting command," Corteen said to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't get any more grandsons and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made like the ground floor, when a huge bomb exploded in a small load that had been parked before the nightclub on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide opposer had exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into the coma for a month after the attack and died three times while hanging on a lifekeeping system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the blood bath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before all others.
To let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber who was in court.
He was almost a decade of arrest, but was finally attacked in the Pakistan City of Abbottabad in January 2011, where U.S. forces killed the former Al-Qaida Chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the negotiation, a FBI agent explained that secret service reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet my shop with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He hasn't put himself," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has suffered to others.
The judgment took place before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which will be committed with Memorial celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: passengers can now use electronic devices in planes (but do not give phone calls)
From departure to landing, air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, music and to see movies, but not to call the phone, so the new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they would be implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA co-worker Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline person and the systems for disturbing the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to develop the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a pronouncement.
Passengers are currently required to disable smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They can only start it again until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and gives the captain green light.
When entering the landing flight, the passengers must turn them off again and must not start them again before the plane has landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when starting, landing and rolling field, the FAA explained.
Most new transport aircraft and other flights that have been converted to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should comply with the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional air crew association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
We are honestly sorry to feel like guardians on this subject.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or download of data remained prohibited under three kilometres, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble-like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines since he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the airport.
And more heavy devices like laptops must continue to be disturbed, as there is a risk of injuries here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile calls during the flight continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAA may prohibit certain electronic devices when starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said of the National Transportation Safety Board, safety experts for national transport issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
"The phone is really a problem, not just because they could cause potential disturbances in navigational devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also disrupt broadcasting masts," said Rosenker.
A consultative committee of the industry, which was launched by the FAA for the examination of this topic, recommended last month that the government permits a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to illuminate restrictions on use.
Critics such as democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly severe, because the use of the devices has become widespread.
In some studies it is mentioned that up to a third of the passengers forgets or ignores the disabling of the device.
In 1966, the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices had been known by passengers, UKW-Radios, who were then the latest tendency of technology.
New planes are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interferences do not matter to them.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the flight height is reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-Reader, for example, only give minimum radiation if you surf.
However, when downloading or sending data, transfer values are stronger.
Among the defenders of a loosening of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but they could not detect.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of use of devices.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he felt that the disturbance of the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only separate reports from pilots that talk about a disruption of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the switching of the devices by passengers in the event of instrument landing under bad perceptional conditions.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would be equipped with technology today.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Reopened by air rescue service by North Sea Bohr Island of Saved Bird
A bird flying on a North Sea Bohr Island was found by air rescue service on the coast, was released into nature.
The water ralles were flyed last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was poured up by the Scottish Animal Protection Organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water bird was probably a winter train bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When the waters were released, the waters were fit and healthy.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and define what those who provide for prosperity and work in Britain want to change to our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 managers from the economy, which form in some of the UK sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow, while the EU states stagnate.
They wish that, from the government side, new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored, instead of stopping with the long and effortful process to reform the obscure EU institutions.
The majority of the economic leaders consider that the control of these key competences should be revoked to Westminster, as requested by their views on certain legally regulated topics – from cartel law to product law.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, since, according to the companies, the costs of Brussels regulations would now exceed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the most traditionally Europeanly friendly.
Finally, and that is probably most likely to say, our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority from the UK wants a course to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade not on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is pressing for a "sensitive change" which brings the power of action back to the UK.
It is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion in favour of the EU's stay in a Volksabstimmung at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the renewal of British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relationships back to the UK from a renewal.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the Eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means a stronger focus on businesses and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gasary
The start of the South-Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom Board.
"The present event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the Chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in an explanation on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide for more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its pendants in Ukraine, where the majority of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk of conventional routes, as it is officially heard.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" disabled.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to favourable prices when the whole project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinated countries should begin on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed on an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.

As German commercials are sought, show the view of the transaction volume, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the plus was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Immobilieninvestments offer attractive interest," said Ulbrich.
The return balance between real estate and federal bonds was at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA co-workers accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offenders
Two YMCA co-workers from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual offences in connection with children before, in 2011, accusations were raised against childcare Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Committee for Sexual Missbrauch of Children learned.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the YMCA had explained that “the organization had never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse”.
Managing director Phillip Hare was asked about a case where a YMCA employee had been accused of child pornography, and another one in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been sentenced in 1991 because of the abuse of his entrusted children.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assisting lawyers that he knew of the first case, but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the opening declaration of the YMCA to the Commission had also been unacceptable in the statement that "the YMCA had given external verifications in which the YMCA was recognised as at the front of child security".
In addition, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the secondest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management had failed “from me downwards” in Lord's attitude and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child security.
Lord was sentenced to the YMCA during his two-year activity for sexual abuse of twelve boys.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare argued that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that employed to notify Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The employees said that they had observed infringements, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, cared for her privately as a babysitter, let her sit on his shot, said to one that he loved it, and let children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor Lord was and who had asked for training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the supervisor of the YMCA Caringbah, “was very intimidating and most of the time very intimate.”
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have complied with to reimburse their supervisor's report.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord affected their judgments, so they would not have reported him.
Hare explained that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to be drawn from the "Jonathan-Lord" intermediate case was "not about reporting" by employees, and the board agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign secretary obligations shortly after the accusations appeared had been made by the Managing Director of the Children's Services of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that it should be prevented from contaminating the evidence, but that which had been "experienced" and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW had not been a safe organization for children in the period between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, said the Commission.
He explained that there were "erntal problems" in the attitude, review, work, training and supervision of the employees.
The hearing was suspended until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his exclusion from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided expressing itself on British policy, and most of its comments have been limited to foreign policy and its role as Messenger of the Quartet of the Peace Foundation in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the office of the Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this happens, so ..."
When the horsesaw experts found themselves in Scharen in Cardiff to shorten the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was ahead.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and did not take his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee sailed through the three rounds and took the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind them.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate maid in a freaking angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural capabilities in dealing with the pony that lie far above his age.
And Toffee received bestnotes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and since then practiced with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and toffee are a great team.”
They had to attack the entire participants' field and have gone from the place with goldpocal and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all enthusiastic when he won.
Full strangers in the Arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was electrized, and everyone fired it and clothed it.”
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to care for.
As he started, it will not take long until he's on the "Pferd of the Year" booth – and I'm sure he's gonna cut well.
A speaker of the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
They're a great team together.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten and presented in the presentation ring.
They take care of good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fenton's sweet clothing has contributed their part, which really fitted perfectly to the occasion.
Chinese newspaper is intended to be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been accused of discrimination, was supposed to be reformed on the forefront, said a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But afterwards, Chen admitted on TV that he had accepted bribe payments to fake reports about a part-state company.
The new expression was now subjected to a 'comprehensive rectification', the regulatory authority stated.
The "Rectoral Regulation" came from the Governing Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express, which belongs to Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incomprehensive reports on the listed company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was inappropriate", the regulatory authority announced in a declaration.
She said that one had decided to “hang a administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license.”
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to perform a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant Responsibles in the New Express and to check immediately the New Express leadership team.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, where he reported about alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and was behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared in the public television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the whole news industry and their ability to gain public confidence," he said to the State Embassy CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was on money and fame.
I realized that I was wrong.
Following Chens apologize, the New Express published an excuse on the title page and explained that it was not possible to verify the reports correctly.
Several known suspicions have recently placed consents on television.
Experts say that consents are still being routinely forced, despite a change in law at the beginning of the year in which authorities were prohibited to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for the drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical railway operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeter measurement tunnel as one of the most secure passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of nearly six football fields, combines warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless unlikely storage halls, which make it easier to hide with drugs loaded trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could not be transported in it, the authorities explained.
In discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of the possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened by a debt sentence between ten years and lifetime.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers sit on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which poses the drug cards the challenge of bringing their product quickly to the consumers.
In 2010, authorities found an almost 640 metres long passage with rails, leaving from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed himself for separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Courie, who should be radiated on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope it".
Kerr and he still loved himself, the 36-year-old emphasized.
"We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, in 2011 her son Flynn was born.
According to Lexika, vegetarism is subject to vegetarism, but it differs considerably from this.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream, ice or a strong Edamer, these sleeves are not on the menu of a Veganer.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the absence of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off from all consumption of animal products - also honey is neglected.
What remains may be questioned, but when you take a closer look at the vegan nutrition world, you can find a remarkable invasion.
"Brotstrichen are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the holder of the local reform house, who provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also enjoys visiting the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealand has been living vegan, in Lampertheim he (fast) finds everything he needs to live. "1997 I turned my diet and became vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of nutrition, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers normal leather.
He realized that it is also in other everyday interests without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor expresses the Maxime of Veganers, which extends to all consumer behaviour.
The Veganer quickly discovered new products, and the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan is not abandoned, not a ascese, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that you reduce the selection of food options with the nutritional environment, Proctor leads back to the power of the habit.
And precisely these conditions also failed some of the attempts that were so well meant.
"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," says Proctor.
And turns in: "Certain tastes are not to be fixed in the animal."
Often they are the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"You can also produce the same effect in another way," explains the Veganer.
At a barbecue festival, for example, Proctor brings Auberginen, Champignons, and a few vegan sausages.
He looks at a balanced, varied diet, where it is supposed to taste delicately.
Of course, you want something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It is to taste, but this is not only to reduce on animal food," says Proctor.
He has not suffered health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share.
There are high-performance athletes that feed only vegan.
"My blood values are best, I often let myself check," says Proctor.
Especially against the lack of vitamin B12, many vegansimus critics warn.
"Because animals are eaten with feed instead of grass on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat that is purchased in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 share is high," Proctor finds.
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are okay," he explains.
Many ways do not have to go to procurement for food.
Basic foods are finally available everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
Anything I need, I'm on the spot.
I'm just buying something special from time to time.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but it is also known for "normal" finished products".
The preparation of vegan dishes would be far more favourable and less time-consuming than generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few small knifes you can achieve good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cuisine, Proctor could also bring his sweaters to the rag.
Family festivals give the Veganer a new sword.
This has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that may arise are as different as people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, skepsis was also brought to him.
Don't you taste my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip.
"I don't dismiss people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to eat enclaves.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not appear as vegan-friended as suspected - and the veganian does not appear as restricted in everyday life as commonly accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are stupids everywhere!
"Many dune shops offer Falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he departs to pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, everything a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slowly on it.
"When I started feeding me vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealand countries can find a development: "You have to talk to the people to make them aware of it."
"If enough demands come, they may be inclined to add the menu", he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, for example, the combustion in Mannheim or the café bird free.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
Actually, vegan dishes are there for all.
Everyone can eat it, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusively.
"Flesh dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, Veganism is a safe way to make the largest part of the front impossible," says Proctor.
But the purchasing of vegan products could be a little difficult at the beginning.
Especially if you learn to understand that animal additives can also be included in peanuts as a colour maker, you seem to leave the courage with the follow-up of ethics in so many barriers and falles quickly.
Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have not only written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients, which are added to food but also cleaning agents.
"In time and afterwards, you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to watch "It's sometimes better to do little steps than to stay standing or stumbling," knows Proctor.
Veganism, he is an important moral fingertip that strikes on consciousness.
Perhaps he does not make it possible for one to reject his habits, but at least he can teach the consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to breathe its customers.
The trade at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator made technical problems responsible.
The other 11 US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour for errors in data transport.
In August this year there were two pans alone in one week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent largely defective purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
Then the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to view and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the whole share trading in the USA came to be made for several hours because of a computer pan at the Nasdaq stock exchange.
In addition, last year, the purchase of Facebook had been provided for attention.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown to the flood of purchase and sale orders, later the SEC stocking oversight established and killed the company to a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Constance: Radler rides 63-year-olds
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was travelling on Thursday night, at 22 o'clock, with a lady bike unjustly on the left road from the station to the marketplace.
Suddenly, when a 63 - year - old man walked from a local road, the bicycle driver was no longer able to brake in time, according to police.
At the following collapse, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and moved to the head a 15-inch long burial wall.
A rescue car team brought the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police authorizes Assange a statement of delivery
Today, the British police handed a statement of delivery to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the ecuadorian message in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had a "require to put himself" that asked him to appear in a police guard, and added, he should not follow it, threatened him to arrest.
Assange threatens the delivery to Sweden because of the claim in a sexual offence after its possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected its objection to the delivery at the beginning of the month.
As he feared that Stockholm would deliver him to the USA, he had sought refuge in the ecuadorian message in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “a 40-year-old man called for a time we have chosen to be at a police guard," said one speaker.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears that he was delivered from Sweden to the United States and complained there for possible spionage claims after he had published more than 250,000 diplomatic news on WikiLeak's release website.
Driver, who had been scattered between the legs with 210 km/h and hot drink, receives 1,000 £ penalty
A driver was imposed on a penalty of £1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the beverage cup between his legs.
Before Colchester's office court, Howie announced himself guilty without driving the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has foreseen by calculating the CGT measures but still awaits the final decision by Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a stamp tax of 7% in the budget of 2012 on apartments that cost more than two million pounds as well as annual fees for buyers, which hold homes as a company and not as individuals.
The revenue from the stamp tax for residential property in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were in 2012/13 at 708 million pounds, summarized the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increase in stamping taxes on high-quality apartments and the introduction of the legislation related to the transition, it is difficult to claim that high-quality real estates are too low, regardless of the effects of the obsolete community tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reserved as regards the purchase of real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling it," he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the apartment market by price – in the prosperous London southwest belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased the record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed an equal annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an ascending 'inland market' on which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, such as a study of Savills.
Scientists were able to throw more light on the context of a dog’s tailwedles with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail weared more to the right (from the dog’s sight), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can observe these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: “The human beings are well known that the left and right brain halfs are differently responding to stimulus that produce positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side of their pants, the researchers monitored the animals while these movies looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behaviour.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves into the one, once in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate other aspects, and so we could control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw a otherwise printless dog moving the tail to the right (looking from the perspective of the wearing dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But was the tail necessity primarily to the left (more from the perspective of the dog wearing), so their heart rate rose and they looked calm.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they should worry and when.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and wedling with the tail in a way is more linked to friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to improve the understanding of the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Medicine at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study in which it was examined whether to the left and right important for dogs.
Last year a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was: “Dollars go to a robot dog when his ,Switz's' turns on the left and not right instead of becoming calm – exactly different from the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore be that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret animals in the films or robotic dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“There are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halfs are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs do not constitute an exception," says Bradshaw.
However, because their behavior is easy to record, it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.

The band's announcement came after she had to move a show in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show in the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and to medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys also have to cancel the show in the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.”
"In Alex Turner, an inflammation of the head was diagnosed, so unfortunately he cannot occur."
The show in the LG Arena in Birmingham takes place on 20 November, which was moved in the Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.

Pope Franziskus appoints first cardinals in February
On February 22, Pope Franziskus will be called for the first time new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergymen in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Franziskus will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached a age of 80 years can no longer participate in the Pope election – that is the case with a group of 120 “optional cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting of all cardinals will take place before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinal, which was also known as a consent.
"Papst Franziskus has decided to publish his decision to initiate the concession in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elevated cardinals would probably have fallen down until February.
He explained that a pope usually designates as many cardinals as needed so that the number of elevated cardinals is again 120, and as many cardinals as he wants over 80.
The concession of the next year is important because it was the first since the election of Franziskus in March this year, says Valero.
At present there is a certain overhang on the side of Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will renew cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Cardinals Council founded by Franziskus, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the commission to find opportunities for the reformation of the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Franziskus has selected these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was “good possible” that Franziskus would ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we were not in this situation – that's all very new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would call cardinals, but Franziskus put “full surprises – so we don’t know who he appoints”.
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA for repair of the seat loan
General Motors call back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup-Trucks with the 2014 construction year to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seating loan, such as a communication from the U.S. regulator for vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the cars, there can be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seating.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety in case of head support.
“If the head support is driven from the back to the vehicle, it is possible that the head support does not properly protect the passengers so that there is an increased risk of injury," the message was read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The revoked models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM-Trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring 2009.
GM informed the owners of the vehicle in the first half of October about the defect.
Due to the 16-day government shutdowns, NHTSA could not check the notification letter, which affected car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, had increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM explained on Friday.
In October GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup-Trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 percent on the New York stock exchange to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
Distortion cry of a Obama voter
I have chosen President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been defeated by the blockadectics of the Republicans
Blockade policy does not apologize the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's Memoirs on the 2008 election struggle would be a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I'm currently reading a terrible sad book.
It is a book that I believed it would bring me up during the sad second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (to win) and describes the Memoirs Barack Obamas as the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm finished with my patient descriptions in the evening and go to bed, then the book leads me back to a time when politics inspired millions and robbed the breath of a speech.
The election was held to be a earth-rutch victory and news speakers kept in mind the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
At that time, Obama changed to office in 2008, he had 82% of the consent values.
And then I'll close the book.
Turning back on the present is a bad awakening, as if you are being snatched out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I gave my voice for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could've imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military deduction from Iraq, the end of the forced vagueness of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the party-political blockadectics have shaken too many efforts with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, in order to mention just a few.
However, after I have defended the Obama government against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have reached the end of my explanation attempts.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to listen to foreign heads or to kill innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished, reveals state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without a procedure, and why the public financing and expenditure limits are being transposed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, which says that the White House's efforts to rest the media are the 'aggressivest... since Nixon' government.
And recently, it cannot apologize the inability to create a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at age 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns it has preceded.
Obviously, the Deputy Office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown Ambassador present the public discussion.
But if I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that's most disturbing me.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidateship.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unequivocal alternative, he seemed to be unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard for so long.
However, with sinking the consent values for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become so harder through this book.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have resolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton in the elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the Electors after the decision, he told his employees that they would have to come back on course and follow the purpose of their business.
"I want us to find our magician again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree to you more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
The Milliardary and Deputy Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave, because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, located in a judicial dispute about the payment of $6 million to CO2 taxes, raised the claim when he wanted to take questions from the table, whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and benefit the daughters of Abbott personally from the laws.
"He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives vacation or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission, with 53 votes, officially declared the winning of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer asked for a revision of the process to tell the voice so that it could go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which you enter into, enter data into a computer, select immediately and then have the result at 6:30 a.m. in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the vocal plate.
If you don't like you, do you want to use them because you can guess the results?
Nowadays, it is incredible to vote with lead pencils.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic choice and has recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy was an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very serious".
A public office is a service to the public.
"We are not striving for any reward except for history, that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two distributors from their foreign exchange department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication of the fact that the worldwide administrative investigation into the suspected manipulation of the monetary market is rapidly taking on ride.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were working with the authorities in the world's largest financial market in which 5,3 billion US dollars are changing the owners every day.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the enlarged investigation that attracts the scandal around the libor interbank business.
The Bank, who did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation related persons indicated that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and was supposed to have been certified by his current position as European head of Forex Spot Trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was approved this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
No one of these dealers was accused of any misconduct.
The Instant Message Group of Usher belonged to bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation close to them.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had explained that she had examined a suspicious manipulation of the exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently concerned with accusations that bankers should have dealt with transactions on the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said familiar people.
Banks pass through instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has moved the dealers into a field of rebellion, which has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play the affairs and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanding and high-grade liquid foreign exchange market, but leading dealers believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks would lead to the fact that “man can already influence the market with very low ticket prices”.
The message came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had canceled a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Fund Fund office this week after he had caused a loss of almost six million dollars last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is imprisoned," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the Bauzaun on the Bechtle base
A group of the civilian initiative "Swiss Wiese" has embraced the Bauzaun on the Bechtle base at the Kurpromenade in Badenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the footway, it says in a press release.
The planned coverage of the decaying house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons, because the ground is threatened to shake off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had rejected the enchanting action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent message "We have been made for it".
However, this was not the case with some 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Her motto on the big poster called "We are against construction ruins".
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail one day.
In the conversation with many passengers before the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the achievement of the city's project would be better, although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city further delays these answers, it says from the side of the BI.
As was heard, the public statements of the mayor also affect.
In May at the municipal council meeting, he had said that he was afraid of the thermal bath, the population should vote on the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss grass.
For this reason, some seem too scared, others feel them as a "plumped attempt to express" on the population, says the press release of BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick skeleton for Schiris: Mane No Schwalbenkönig
Even though Ralf Rangnick is satisfied with the current high-form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bullen" was disappointed by the arbitration judges.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are pushed into the category of sulphur kings," he took the two offensivewirbles in protection at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
Latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese became a alleged activist - which was no one, as the TV pictures showed.
"A crap of wrong decision," said Rangnick, who called arbitrary judge Harkam as "followed".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
His German Landsmann defended him: "I would have been the same in every situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the shoe with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"When I am the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old emphasized.
In view of the success, Rangnick voted for a praise.
"There are only two words for this: good," he found.
There isn't much to stop.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
That's gonna go on so quietly.
Border changes in winter transfer time will hardly exist.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Apart from a player, he wants to leave the club," Ranknick stated.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: the US Supreme Court today decided that the closely associated health law with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to conclude a health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional in the context of the State's tax authority.
The chief judge John Roberts struck on the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided on the other hand.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page comprehensive law and also held the view that the requirements of the health law, which states would need to extend either the conditions for access to Medicaid or otherwise eliminate all State Medicaid claims, should not be inconstitutionally restrictive.
The action procedure against the law was endeavored by 26 federal states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decisively rejected by all the leading Republican presidency candidates, including the final publisher Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian location is making light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low level of sunset, the Rjukan in Vestfjord Valley usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters altitude, a century dream was observed on Wednesday.
"Endly!", mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the start ceremony in the TV2 broadcaster.
Some valley dwellers got sunsets, others set up safely for sunbrills.
To date, sunshine had to go to a close peak in winter with a cable car.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to lead the rays with mirrors into the valley.
This basic idea, however, has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about EUR 615 000) expensive project.
For some years a similar construction has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella.
Post is hardly empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will have not yet noticed that the red points for the Sunday emptying are still on various core city and parts of the city, but if you read the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find that the emptying of Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP notes.
A request from the FDP has confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the postal building in the Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in the Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld is cleared.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still empty Sunday, the answer to the FDP's request is not answered.
The social and youth-political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow here.
The Sunday emptying is an important post service just at the date post.
"This company, despite the price increase for letters on January 2013, thins out radically and unreasonable."
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and the City Association, supports his colleagues: "What is angry with me is the fact that the emptiness times are changed or deleted in the clams."
The post is miles away from the nearest of the citizens.
"At least, the brilliant boxes in the districts of Neusschloss and Rosengarten have to be cleared again on Sunday," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Even for the core town, especially not mobile fellow citizens, a letter box with Sunday emptying would have to be able to reach in a short distance.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament if the city administration plans to talk to the post about this thing.
Mayor Erich Maier answered that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, is also a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken for privatizations.
"Then decisions are taken elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurter Parking fees should rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be more sensitive.
The city's Magistrate advises today in the morning about a presentation of traffic dezerent Stefan Majer (Green).
Therefore, parking fees should be increased by 50 percent.
However, it is not to raise prices, but to shorten the time interval of parking clocks and parking cars from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, then the City Ordering Assembly has to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers it "not for a good idea".
The possibility of parking immediately before the business is "a non-administrative advantage for smaller traders".
The German transport club believes that an increase after two decades is "decently appropriate and actually overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions overlap hosts
With a narrow frame, the Lords I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to arrive at the Schiller School Hall in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Schwebian Alb.
The Elbler stood with an experienced team on the other side of the network.
Soon, however, it was demonstrated that they could not be able to take full part in the quick actions of the joy cities .
The Gönningers were extremely difficult with the hard and placements.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the network center and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all interests.
In view of this oppressive and game-advanced performance, the third sentence was won somewhat lax and luxurious to the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, with the TV Baierssbronn, which was able to work out in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent will be on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the second teams from Baierssbronn and the city of joy were located in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fighted two-hour hit.
Nervosity on both sides caused errors and scores especially when baling; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes deficiency and in some critical game scenes, the overseas prevented the view of possible points gains.
In this highly balanced meeting, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team voted by means of the great physical use and a delightful commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English cottage
On the fifth day of nursing in the succession of the Natura 2000-Project of Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach.
On the basis of suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the hut of view to the valley, mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers, so Emperor, called this area as the shiny piece of the gorgeous slope, where the landscape offers the ideal framework for magnificent views.
He thanked the attendant for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the nursing day was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection of humanity and nature.
He offered every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological consideration could also be found.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Protection of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the predomination and wanted the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the wide view is to preserve the old allmend garden with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grass coppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to maintain art.
Tribukait said she didn't want to miss it at this point to break a lanze for the planned biosphere area.
In this plan, the current measure is not only seamless.
A biosphere area also offers the chance of sustainable economic and ecological development based on internationally recognised ounceco status and thus a continuous supplement to the future achieved with the life project and the previous nursing days.
Following these different versions, district leader Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helpers in groups.
The larger trees had already been struck in the front, the forest slepper would be ready to call.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of guards and the care of a dry stone barbecue.
The objective was the free viewpoint.
Löffingen: Heads of one candidate still
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future-based school, children's, youth and senior policy, as well as its own city works can be described as attractive city, no second Mayor candidate has yet been reported.
As a single candidate for the succession of the old-age mayor Norbert Brugger has been established by the 46-year-old bank merchant and business owner Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application period will take place on Monday 11 November at 18 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei accused for Nortel-Patenten
On Thursday, the group, which owns thousands of former Nortel-Patente, stricted a lawn of claims for patent violation of cell phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was offered by Nortel during the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that the Nortel patents bought for 4.5 billion US dollars, complained Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the US County Court in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the community of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is notified in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents involved technology which brings search terms on the Internet into line with relevant advertising, so the action that meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google's operating system Android, which stands in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google increased his offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After it was offered by Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $12,5 billion, a business that was also motivated by Motorola's library to patents.
"Although Google failed with his attempt to acquire the complaint patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," said the complaint letter.
Rockstar demands a high loss of damage from Google, as it claims that Google's patent violation is intentionally, so the accusation.
Egypt defends first freely elected Presidents
Mohammed Mursi dismisses the office oath, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was defended as the first elected president of the country and thus attacked the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been displaced from the office 16 months earlier.
With its introduction in front of the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of monarchy about 60 years ago.
He put the oath in front of the 18 black robes dressed judges of the court, which has its seat on the Nile and has been reaped to an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," said Mursi at the festive ceremony, which was transferred live in public television.
"Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an educated engineer and a Muslim brotherhood member in the United States, a fundamentalist group, who has been mostly taken into sight since its founding 84 years ago as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in front of the court to excite the new president, and, unlike the presidial prunk from the Mubarak-time, traffic was stopped for a short time so that the car convoi could cross the usually busy road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “set wheel” of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech, where he not only presented himself as a candidate of Islamists but all those who wanted to address the efforts of the 2011 rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red crowds, to judges in the wooden chamber in which he delegated the office owl.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to hold his speech.
He was officially welcomed by a army chapel who played the National Hymne, who he listened in Habacht.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants in the largest hearing hall of the university with speaking of "The Army and the People are a hand".
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a basement of secular education, has developed into a high-bourg Islamist student group in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi placed a symbolic oath on the Tahir site, the birthplace of the rebellion, which last year led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and praised to call back presidial powers that the military council had taken over from the office.
But with the dismissal of the official eide in front of the court and not as usual before Parliament, he curtails the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic popular gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season started at the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet".
Today's Friday evening it's called "Pump this party", on tomorrow's Saturday evening it's going on with a 25-U.S. party.
Of course, fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed by head: severely injured
During the exchange of a defected external feeler on Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder and fell seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to exchange a defective heating sensor at the outside facade of a guesthouse.
When he rose to the ladder on the roof rings, it slipped away and the man crashed on the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to Salzburg with the rescue scubble "Christophorus 6".
Rapeer in South Africa: two times a life-long prison
Nine months after the brutal rape and infusion of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice life-long on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC sender.
The victim later died from the consequences of severe injuries.
John Kana had been found guilty at the beginning of the week of crime.
The act had caused disturbance throughout the country.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought 14 hours for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The youth's sight was so horrible that the nurses and sisters needed psychological support.
Kana had admitted during the process to have been in a bar in the Tatnight with Booysen.
He also managed to be struck and raped, but he contended to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had first taken out of several offenders but left two suspects out of detention because the evidence against them did not satisfy them.
The prosecutor also stressed during the procedure that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rapes are almost everyday in South Africa: There are about 64 000 advertisements for sexual violence each year.
These are almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, they have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa appreciate the dark counts in sexual violence but the 10- to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest
Jumbo looking for the "best ham" of the world: For the TV broadcast "Galileo", the Pro7 Star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker makes it clear at the beginning: the most important for ham are the pig cows, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains the operation of the "Adler" company in Bonndorf.
"Germany lovely ham," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes into the inside of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he can grab the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening at fast imbiss in Waldshut
"Here I'm being worked with roasty quantities," the television makers, black forests shining as a mass product.
16.000 cereals a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat share, color: Uli explains what the quality is about.
Most of the pigs are slaughtered with six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"There I am excited when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then," says Jumbo cynical.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is worth it.
The viewer sees that the decay of the cubes continues to be handmade.
Because: Black forests shining is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoking tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo visually of a "U boat".
The trick: Tann branches provide the special taste of the Black Forest shining here in smoke.
20 days in smoke, the ham finally makes almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the Jumbo," he announces the test fever.
"It's really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will allow all stakeholders to live.
You thought travel offices belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects records from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The traveling company is now going out of an adjusted annual profit before taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are achieved, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre earned eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries are beneficial and some of them are well towards record year revenues before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically one of our strongest results.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, which was a slightly weaker market for business trips.
It was similarly good for Flight Centre's leisure business in the UK, while the business customers also spend less.
The US business recovered against the seasonal condition of weaker first half of the year, so that a profit is expected for the third year as a result of the overall year.
The shares of Flight Centre increased by 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are stopped to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses of English literature, students will need to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The test also includes 'unseeked texts' in order to stimulate broader reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
As of 2015, pupils must take a separate GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new teaching plans for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been transformed radically.
Other core areas will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Supervisory Authority for Tests, will announce a new organisation of the GCSE structures, including a new note system and less course work.
In a summer speech, Minister of Education, Michael Gove said that there is a “great consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence” and stressed that the GCSEs would become“ more demanding, more ambitious and stricter.”
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent for mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours each year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hour schedule, coalition circles say that the comprehensive mathematics testing – combined with a stronger weighting of the specialist in ranking lists – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours.
In the curriculum, more attention is given to 'problems of the right life', including financial mathematics.
Funny animals and delicious caves
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and color strikes present the circulation performance view this weekend in the civil house.
Reviews have been made on Thursday
Once again, the W514 village association will execute this great exhibition.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
At the next ecumenical talk forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle, it is about the topic "To hell with hell - Theological considerations for today's dealing with the last things".
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The ecumenical talk forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical church communities Salem, Salem Castle and Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to examine in the forum of the question, as today people are taking up the "last things" after death.
If humans had known too much of it in the past centuries and had put it on those pictures of heaven and hell, "who are presenting our ideas to this day," the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of completion is rather reflected by some embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been exaggerated by the religious criticism," says the referendum.
She has "bounded us with so many question marks that the call signs seemed to have turned us off".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the anger of death."
This is the question of that longing, "which dreams of being good at the end".
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She studied Dr. theol in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation of Fundamental Theology and Ecumenic Theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms University.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has been a chair for systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislings: More than 100 young Catholics of the Little Heuberg confirm their confession of faith in firming
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the seal care unit On the Kleinen Heuberg have been firmed.
In the morning, the Laudato-Si group accompanied the service, in the afternoon of the Youth Chor The Spirit.
With the reception of the firm sacrament, the youths said yes to their baptism and asked the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past months, the firms had prepared themselves under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the assistance of numerous municipal members for the great festival.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and experienced the youth day in Submachtal together.
Illusion: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
At magnificent weather, 214 bicycle riders came to Ilvolene to manage the round course over the hill chains around the lake.
This informs Ulrich Knobel of the organising sports club Ilvolee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 meters, were also numerous everyone's wheels who wanted to perform their hobby once in a competition atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
These two were able to set off the field in expectation.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small period of time to the destination and defended his title as a total winner of the short distance.
On place two, Pascal Treubel was again placed.
With the ladies, Theresa Duelli was the team's nightmare, which made it to the top of the winners.
On the square two and three Anne Adel from Ilvolee and Leone came drivers from Owingen.
A delightful development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only was the whole range of athletes represented in terms of power.
The age structure also ranged from ten years in the youngest to over 70 years with the oldest launchers.
In the main race this year, more absolute topathlets were started.
Four drivers were able to depart from the regional top drivers.
Among them, Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike helbprofi from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was already two times world champion at the 12-hour holidays.
This year he became Europe champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German master titles in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 meters of height, there was a wimpernschlagfinale in the target run in front of the Three-Seen-Halle.
Pangerl was the first to rush over the target line.
Only a second behind the routinier Ballerstedt could secure the second place in the overall rating.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as a third of the overall evaluation.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized expiry of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to distant villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Voice here or with your mobile device
Dr. George's Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George’s bwelle saw how his ill father lost his consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and caused a haematom that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overfilled clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but it's not the first one.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has barely changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for each 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 persons.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroons couldn't afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the health spending in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his landmen suffered in Bwelle made it mature to do something against it.
Dr. George's Bwelle and his volunteer team have carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor and worked as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, travelling in rural areas on weekends and offering free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people are in small buses and riding on the roof with the scarred medical equipment over unmounted terrain into the villages that need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebration and bwelling – with its broad smile and its unlimited energy – is happy at the cheerful celebration.
The next morning the team then starts investigating hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per ride," says Bwelle.
They come from an area of 60 kilometres around the village – and that is on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others get chickens, donated brilliants or free birth certificates – a document necessary for school but many poor families can simply not afford.
In the evening, the team runs simple operations with local deceit.
Operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the intervention, the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the neighbor.
The illumination for the OP and the disinfection equipment is eaten by the generator of the group and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning on Sunday.
It is an effortful pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drumble all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon physicians and foreign medical students – last year has carried out 700 free operations and knows that with her work it makes an enormous difference for people to help them.
One man explained that the free operation of a breach that he received would now enable him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest came from private donations.
"I really don't know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying at the Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering in Bwelles Group.
He's always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to collect practical experiences they would never get at home.
“We can be involved in surgery where we help to drop blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated sanity material.
But once in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and guidance.
"He is no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life of this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits.
For bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise that he has given to his Father brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm gonna make it to bring people back to laughter and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the struggle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novelle "The old man and the sea", is cut on the body.
Janson himself is an old hate in his metier, the art of acting.
The old man Santiago can't pretend to fish.
So the two simply complement greatly.
It is almost meant that you can see the folds in the neck of the old man, of whom the fishermen's boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is tired of life bent on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and finally wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his willingness.
Janson is on long distances as a single performer on stage.
He makes it possible to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues are no moment boring.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishermen's village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in the light: The hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor, which with its songs and their glorious voices sings the sense of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play Kubas rhythm and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Departure to the Romans
A wastewater channel from the Roman era is received at about 120 metres of length below Cologne.
Whoever visits Cologne doesn't come by the Dome.
Around 157 meters, the two towers hurry into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
However, only a few visitors who admire the two filigrane cherry towers knew that there is a lot to discover even under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
Meeting point for his tours is the service center of Cologne Tourism directly at the Dom.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted to be an autonomous city, so from the rest of the old city walls, what was not too big.
Therefore, most of the users of the parkhouse today are hurrying over to the Roman remnants and only turning off their cars.
But whoever looks more closely, discovers in the Park Deck D2 an archaeological archaeological archaeological site separated by metal grids.
There are about five meters of high ruins made of towel-size stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze leaves the participants on the upper park level to take a look into a dark, 15 meters deep suit.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is hardly perceived.
Next station of the tour is the premise, and here the participants get down to the depth.
We experience the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the president of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinsium", which in good German means as much as "City of Roman Rights and City of Agrippins, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for Emperor Cult".
And the presidency is the former Governor Palace, the center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the premise of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman wastewater channel, which is preserved here at about 120 metres long.
"You can walk a piece quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," coincides Schulze the guests.
A surprise still has schools.
After he picked the key at the box, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, easy-to-use box.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for the ritual washings.
Until today, at the bottom of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighteenth century, different water levels can be discerned by changing peaks of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall for which the construction work is to begin in a short time.
But until the completion, there will be a few years.
Almost hacked leg: rebuilding of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is rerolled after more than four years.
A process of attempting deaths, dangerous body injury and damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
He is accompanied by strict security measures.
The accused ones swept up.
They were supposed to have been active in the rockers scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecutor suggests that in June 2009, together with unknown complications in Finowfurt, they have poured into a car to three men.
All victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims were supposed to have heard of the competing group of Hell's Angels.
One of them was supposed to have been a high-level member from Berlin.
It seemed that a persecuting chase with several cars was preceded.
According to the accusation, it was about territories and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were released in a first procedure in early 2012.
A court speaker then said that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feather.
The perpetrators wore masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof raised the judgment after revision of the prosecutor and resigned it to the Landgericht for the renewal of proceedings.
One of the accused is currently in the open execution because of another offence.
It was mainly about the reconstruction of the courses in Tatnight.
As a witness, the Commissioner was invited to know at that time.
In the center, phone calls were held by the accused and other people who had heard the police.
Difficult is that Rocker in court almost always keeps himself up to a more law for her, and not to say.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been packed out.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Prosecutor (Oder) said on demand that new traces have appeared since the last procedure.
For the process, eleven further negotiation days are set.
The shipyard company does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but some time it goes home.
Only: In the trees of the people on the rider and back seat, the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, some cocktail or sect may be responsible for that!
What's closer than chilled to go to the next drive-in to enjoy a little?
I admit, I'm glad to be there when it's going late night or early morning at the fast food holes.
A few pommes, a cola, a castle - and then nothing like home and bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco guests are noticeable.
Because what has to be missing that, with steady regularity, you throw your fast-food bags out of the car window?!
Especially during the weekends are discarded paper bags on road edges and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are the people too deaf to take the bags with home respective to the next trash?
It's not just like the paper product dispatchs the landscape.
Suits have also covered transport facilities such as guiding planks and thus triggered accidents.
About this, however, does not mean "wayway society", probably she doesn't even know what this word actually means.
When you're on the way in the evening, only with several people in the car, you know how a backbank can look after through-feated nights: clames, bottles and other waste are going to be there.
There would be a few bags, more or less, that would not matter - in contrast to the road where no one wants to trumpet on the food remains of others.
I already see the day when the cities and communities are going to bleed away - and the fast food chains must demand for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal in health policy
After severe criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday with his frequently repeated, clear promise: "If your health insurance pleases you, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people from their insured person received a notice of cancellation, the Republicans threw the president in the last days, he deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relatived his original promise.
"The majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can retain them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the cancellations, Obama asked those Americans who received such communications to look after a new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens could receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
"They come a better offer," he said.
The government described it as little as surprising that the five percent of the population that themselves have completed insurance would have to look after another rate, since their contract did not complies with the new standards according to the affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans that they deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Representative House in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
"I am just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to get your trust back.
This pronunciation of a sebelius to a seated consultant at the yesterday hearing at the House of Representatives was received after an interview with the Republican Ms. Billy Long from Missouri. It was the question of whether she should be committed to participation in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly threatened with the question of why the “architecture” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily abandon a State-supported insurance in order to conclude a price at HealthCare.gov, which it now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Aviation Support
A U.S. government officer who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to the U.S. news sender CNN that Israeli fighting aircraft had attacked an air force base in the Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
The goal was "Rakettes and related equipment" which the Israeli government feared that they were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, it was said CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the support point in the port city of Latakia had been shot in the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis had been responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, on which Russian defensive missiles of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles were seen, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilometres.
Insecurity The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters News Agency also quotes an anonymous Israeli government official with the words that he believes that Israel has executed the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman of the Israeli Ministry of Defense said, "We don't comment on these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver ground air missiles to the Hisbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that every attempt by Syria to provide the Hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the crossing of a "red line", which would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented consent that the US spionage was "inappropriately gone too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected consent, demonstrated a disproportionateness of the US's defensive attitude with regard to their monitoring programmes by saying that spying was "inappropriately too far".
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also admitted that he was deceiving together with Barack Obama the responsibility for having been turned on the "Autopilot" when the explosive revealings of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the spying activities of the NSA.
Through the transmitted information, the US government has been driven into a diplomatic storm of disarmament from its allies.
In a video-connected speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “The President and I, as well as others in the government, have experienced some things that have expired quasi by autopilot, simply because the ability was to do what was still to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course to September 11.”
He then agreed as the first high-level member of the US government that the US spionage had exceeded a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: “In some cases, this has gone too far.”
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore conduct a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel the feeling, there is abuse taking place.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process.
Kerry, however, pointed out that the NSA was a power of good and had been saved many lives through their monitoring processes.
He added: “We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to jump themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is destined to kill people, to jump into the air and to attack governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented airplane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
In the meantime, US legislators will travel to Europe to disperse the concerns against the alleged American spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in anti-terrorism, as the president of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terror organisations because of the frustration of monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts to combat terrorism," said Murphy, who is in the Senate as a Democrat for the first time and acts as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger on the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US associations, although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were inadequate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by Nato associations and exchanged with the United States.
Other revealings quoted from documents distributed by Snowden, which the NSA monitored the cell phone of Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended the spying in allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said that his authority prepared the journey of the convention to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members are to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still being developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some “first words”.
He said that the European governments would have to be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs that they themselves have been using for years.
"While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also find ourselves with the fact that we are not the only ones who are pioneering," says Murphy.
In the meantime, John Kerry is on a journey to the Middle East and to Poland during the weekend to deal with the grief about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.

Australian invoices against prison penalties in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15-day prison in Phuket because she falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed against the judgment and was released on deposit.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false statement after she had stated to the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped them in the morning on Sunday, June 10, while two other men held them.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely reached her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they stood to figure out the story.
Until the court proceedings, she was on site in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison in a low-security prison at the margin of Phuket, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy-Liga, who went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks said to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely worried" about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have her back to Australia.
“We are of course very worried, but we hope that it will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on a free foot.
In Australian reports it was to read that in the meantime she makes holidays in the resort of Krabi in Southern Thailand.
On the side of the court, Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in a adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Michelle Smith in Phuket, it is also possible that Thailand could be trying to improve his attacked tourist image, and it is therefore a free speech.
