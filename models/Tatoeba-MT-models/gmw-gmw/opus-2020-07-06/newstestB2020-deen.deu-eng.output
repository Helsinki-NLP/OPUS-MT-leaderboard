Fire deleted in French chemicals
The large fire in a particularly dangerous chemistry in the north-French city of Rouen has been deleted. This shared the prefecture of the Normandie on Friday. The fire was broken out on Thursday during the night. Nobody was injured at the incident. The fire gun was in use with about 200 deletion vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainers were called not to leave their houses. Buildings in around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and children's gardens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemistry on the bank of the Seine, additives are produced for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-Milliardär Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly stringent security requirements.
In the factory, around 400 people work. The chemistry factory already provided for headlines in the past - for example, when the gas methantolial was removed by a leak in 2013 and the environment was widely smoking after faint eggs. In 2015, after an operation accident, some 2,000 litres of mineral oil fled into the city's wastewater system.
Woman announces her job to search for 57 days of her disappeared dog
For two months a woman from Washington searched for her disappeared dog - and announced an extra job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had been cut out of the hotel room during a short holiday in Montana. 57 days were missing from the dog - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was horrible. I got bad," said Carole King to the "Dayly Inter Lake". She and her husband had Hündin Katie left in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Afterwards, when they returned to the hotel, Katie was disappearing. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could still stay in the hotel somewhere else, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says: "It was about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately out. A loud thunder probably had put the dog in panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But from days I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postman to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flesh"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man reported himself and said that Katie was in his courtyard. But when King arrived there, Katie was already disappearing again. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her hend under a tree. "I just embraced her. I didn't want to let her go," said King, "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears fled. People kept up in their vehicles, rose out and embraced us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found them."
Losses in the Federal Army: Machine guns disappear spurlessly
Friday 27 September 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Federal Army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shot ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. In most cases the residual is unclear. The opposition speaks of a "angerous" extent.
In the Federal Army, weapons and ammunition are repeatedly disappearing - many of them so far spurless. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has reported the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons parts and almost 20,000 shots ammunition. This is the result of a listing of the Federal Defense Ministry, which reports the German editorial network.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, a weapon part and 3474 shot ammunition have appeared again. The still disappeared weapons and weapons parts are among others six machine guns of type MG3, eleven guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns and two pistols of type P8. In addition, 30 arms tubes of type MG3 are missing.
The amount of weapons and ammunition losses in the Federal Army was "angerous," said the Left-Bundestags Member Martina Renner. This was all the more, since in the course of investigations, little more had been found. The Left-Politist spoke of a "third balance". Renner criticized that in the listing it was not possible to recognise whether under the disappeared ammunition the one who was also found in connection with the investigations against the German army officer Franco A. "And that although a supporter of Franco A. has recently been condemned because of the possession of this ammunition," Renner said.
Oil cancer "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on this Friday. As ship observation data of Refinitiv showed, the tanker was in motion and left the Iranian port. As a destination port, Port Rashid was given in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he was first left in Iranian waters. From the shipyard it said that one wanted to wait for an official decision from Teheran.
On July 19th, the "Stena Impero" was defeated by the Iranian revolutionary garden in the Hormuz sea street under the prerogation of violating security rules. However, it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tank before the Gibraltar belonging to the United Kingdom.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have been intensified in recent months. The trade shipship was taken into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There were several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of people in the fresh revolution
Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel cherished the commitment of people in the DDR 30 years ago to the Fruitful Revolution. In autumn 1989, courageous citizens would have waxed the DDR regime, Merkel said at a festival of the Thüringer CDU group on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor reminded of the occupation of the Stasi-Centrale. "The state security was taken to fear," she said.
Musk seeks delivery record
Teslas quarter may keep records ready. Despite delivery tree, there were last losses in the electric car group.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given strong boost to his electric car group with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100.000 deliverys," wrote Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the "Electrek" industry blog.
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musks newsletter. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customership. Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Attorneys liked that: Teslas shares went out of the trade with a plus of over six percent. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95000 cars and thus achieved its best value.
Musk needs records to reach its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be made in the current and next quarter of the year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the tree there were last losses.
Solved puzzles: That's why we can't kitzle ourselves
A kind of Bremse in the big hirn prevents people from being able to kitch themselves. This was the result of scientists from the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments to rats, as they told them on Thursday evening. It was also made progress on the question of why children are so strongly fighting the kitzels, just to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the approach of a tilting hand triggers laughing before touching. This was lying on a low layer in the big throat, which already triggers laughing at the expectation of the kitzeln.
According to the information, previous research showed that rats respond with "lach" in the ultrasound area when they are citrated by humans. This "lag" is conveyed by the part of the large herrrind, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Smile is suppressed during self-contamination
So far, it has been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-contacting and touching by others - so people can't cheat themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that laughing as well as the activity of the area in question of the large brainrinds were suppressed during self-contact. This is also true if living creatures were cleaning themselves. During the external touch and kitzeling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse were increased.
However, passing self-contact and touching by others at the same time, if laughing also suppressed. This suggests that the brain of the rat could not be distinguished between self-contacting and touching by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot curse themselves because self-contacting activates a brake in the large brain.
The rats were also trained to cheat themselves. Thus, they disrupted this initiation in the experiment sometimes in advance, showed escape behaviour or horror. This ambition was the same as the behaviour of the children. The ambition of the kitzeln is a behavioral reaction that was equal to the behaviour of rats and humans.
Dismissed disaster: Great fire in French chemicals deleted
The large fire in a particularly dangerous chemistry in the north-French city of Rouen has been deleted. This shared the prefecture of the standard andy of the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire was broken out in the night on Thursday.
According to the authorities, there should be no health-threatening substances. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. Nobody was injured during the incident. The firefire was in use with about 200 deletion vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Inhabitants were called not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister said Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in Parliament after the suspension of the dwangspause on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country from the EU on 31 October without agreements, should not allow Brussels to accept its requests for amendments to the Brexit Agreement. However, as he wants to achieve this, it is unclear.
About Cox, who had been used for the United Kingdom's stay in the European Union, said the Prime Minister: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memorial and to re-establish this country would have been to execute the EU's exit." Cox was murdered by a legal extremist during the referendum election in 2016.
Mahnmal for attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths in Norway, the Monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Eisenroses) is revealed on Saturday in Norway. They recall the roses that had been deposited by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Dome in Oslo.
At the same place, the project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be uncovered - the roses were smed by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims. For opening, among other crown prince Haakon and crown princess Mette-Marit are expected.
On July 22, 2011, the legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first fired a car bomb in Oslo's government district and killed tens of participants from the youth organization of the Socialist Party in the island of Utöya. Overall, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Debate brought no solution in the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could get back to the lake. It could be a puzzle piece in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid July is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as Stena Bulk told.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now travel for medical investigations to Dubai, said Reederei Chief Erik Hånell. In the afternoon, the ship left the Iranian waters. "Because it's over," he said to the Swedish television station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain the shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
On 19 July the Iranian revolutionary gardens had been set out to the tanker under the prerogation of disregarding sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released early in September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing the circumstances accordingly well, said Hånell. They had been professional in the face of the difficult and experiencing situation over the past ten weeks. The boarding work now to bring them together with their families as soon as possible.
The British Government suspected that after the establishment of the Stena Impero, a similar incident in British Gibraltar, there was a super-tanker from Iran, which was supposed to have been set to Syria, on the chain. According to the authorities, the supply was contradicted against EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The reference to the ship had received the British from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Courages, it was a exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" free from London.
Hormus's road is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have been intensified over the past months. The trade shipship has been taken into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There were several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Teheran and Washington, the nuclear dispute of both countries. The Americans presuppose the Iranian leadership to want to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The U.S. had all in 2018 gone out of the international nuclear agreement, which would prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb and should end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put the leadership in Teheran with massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure to force a more stringent and in other areas extended agreement. Iran is resisting the pressure to date.
Due to the dispute about the Stena Impero and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the USA are working on a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the street of Hormus at the UN Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protection powers, wants to ensure the security of shipship in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestinated as the "war gainer". Given the penalty duties imposed by American President Donald Trump against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to redispose. Financial chiefs of Asian companies who consider to transfer their production from China to another country call India in a survey of the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This does not only have to do with the inevitables of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool to young workers as well as a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to play a more important role in the globally branched production chain.
But now India itself has been focused on Trumps. From the hood in the White House devaluating as "Coloin of Customs", America has withdrawn the trade advantages for 2000 products to the emerging country in early June. The USA prohibits India and demands a better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the rice with India is freely an adjacent spot. In addition, America also considers the world's largest democracy through the security-policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combines the concern of China's power claims in the South Indian Ocean. A salve of American criminal duties against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh in safety.
However, the problem lies in another place: The empirically hardened theses that open markets accelerate economic development has a severe state in the Socialist Republic of India. His reform electoral aims mainly to the bureaucratic instinct, which in the state of the multi-popular state has swept all too long entrepreneurial spirit. Company now receives faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more tangible insolvency and bankrupt law creates conditions for liquidating seemote companies with high debts faster.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic optics in India in the first five modes-years, however, it does not apply to trade policy. It is therefore irreparable to protect internationally little competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even set up new barriers.
In the west, modes of the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews its country. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister only knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. In the core, the "India First" advokat never depends on a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to decompose anachronistic processes and thus fit for global competition. Businesses who survive through the dislocation of their industries are among the tribal selectors of fashionist Bharatiya Janata Party and clause these short-sighted policies.
Adopted by Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to the former French president Jacques Chirac, a report will be postponed in Paris in the next week. The former head of State will be deposited on Monday at Montparnasse cemetery in the southern French capital, the AFP news agency reported to the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. A public funeral celebration was held on Sunday in Paris's Invalidendom, as media reported.
The competitors carried into the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the light athletic WM
The world peak has long been in the goal of playing warming scenes in the low-cooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swim dangerously. He could hardly hold 300 meters before the destination, ran into unsaved attitude when Braima Suncar Dabo from the western African country Guinea-Bissau suddenly interrupted him and supported him the last half-stadion round of the goal. However, the forces were still enough to stop the running clock after the end of the goal. As the scene would not have been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was totally unexpected about the attention of the gathered journalists. He was not going to talk about his heroes at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only one of the sufferers. And yet he would be proud to represent his country invited to the World Association. Under normal circumstances, he would not have even be allowed to start. "That is why I am proud to walk here for my country," he said.
He did this on the evening with emphasizing - and much more intense than he probably thought. For this hero act will remain in memory. At least Dabo even let his competitors Busby take the lead in the goal and voluntarily took over the last place - by the way well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega who won this predecessor. At the end, it had nothing to use, because the busby came into the goal was just disqualified precisely by the end of the World Light Athletic Association.
Dabo, who lived in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, arrived to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, it was at 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to walk 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes." However, only in training, the best times do not count.
Million Mash: Egyptians are preparing for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible government-critical protests. A stronger police presence was observed in the centre of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir site were locked.
In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls, and the mobile phones of pedestrians were partially searched for messages and photos related to protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
During the past weekend, it came to protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They were against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, criticist corruption and misconduct. A so open protest against the political leadership had not been given in Egypt for years. The Egyptian exile entrepreneur and actress Mohammed Ali, who played the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook for today's Friday, called for a "Millionsmarsch" at central places in the country. Ali calls for a "Volksrevolution". The man is also not "golder" for most young Egyptians, because he was a subcontractor for the army millions, but his messages came.
The number of arrests related to the protests increased by two observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had more than 1.570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures were not confirmed at first. The government did not confirm and comment on the figures.
Accidential arrests
Many people were "protected" "only because they were" at the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW told arresters under appeal on lawyers. According to their lawyers, the accusations against the arrests ranged from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces surveyed and searched in Uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW claims, also arbitrary passengers.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Retailers: Distributors should be able to spend returnes easier
For online dealers, many packages returned are lost. About 20 million returnes land so on the waste. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown an online dealer such as Amazon and Zalando a way to spend back-send products instead of destroy them.
Although the companies could not be excluded from the turnover tax on cheese donations, the Ministry stated on a question of the Green-Bundestag fracture, which the newspapers of the Funke-Mediengruppe reported on Friday, but the dealers could put the market value of uncoupling returns so low that they would not have to pay any or only little turnover tax.
Scientists from Bamberg University have found that when ordering on the Internet, the German citizens return every sixth package. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the waste. They would spend the companies in addition to money after current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate bills such as a turnover that then affects turnover tax.
Green-Fraktions-chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with an indication that companies are able to evaluate non-coffee products accordingly and donate freely to non-profit organisations. The companies would have to rely on not being punished for donations. This is not only valid for online trade, but also for other businesses from fashion shop to construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underscores "the rehabilitation of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic preservation of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting at Sotheby's in the British capital is to be exhibited until it is to be auctioned on October 3. It is estimated at EUR 1.5 to two million.
The work was first exhibited in the Museum of Bristol in the southwestern United Kingdom in 2009, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist once again exhibited the painting - simultaneously with the original Brexit date on March 29th. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Fragestunde", was renamed to "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had recently delivered a tough drop-off with the opposition at the first meeting of the Subhause after a force breaking down by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson intends to execute the Brexit, which had already been moved twice on 31 October, even without agreements with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, intervenes in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a girl. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when they enter the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "spacing in the park"
The fierce verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy was a "spaziergang in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy this. We will come out (from the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had hardly attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past days and, among other things, proposed "trust" to the people. An accusations that he could threaten the honourable Members, because they could become a goal of murder threats, he deprived as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to return to rest is if the Members would finally respect the British decision to withdraw from the EU. It is not surprising that the people had been surprised that the UK had still not been out of the EU for three years after the referendum.
In view of the uploaded mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for retention on Friday. "We should speak with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan again asked the United Nations to take action in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN Assembly.
Otherwise, a war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely to be again, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. "If that is bad, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial domination in 1947, two of them around the shared Kaschmir region. Both nuclear powers have each dominated a part of Kashmir, another part belonging to China. In early August India had withdrawn the Indian Kaschmir region autonomy status and thus significantly increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the fall of the Egyptian president al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with hard hands. It is able to shoot with sharp ammunition on the population, more than 2000 arrested gathered in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting was never harmful in Egypt. However, since the power of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything to avoid a scenario such as at the time of the Arabic spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspectivelessness and the feeling of being sent by its own government pushed millions to the road. And this is a problem which also does not get the regime of el-Sisi, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third party lives in Egypt under the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stages, produces food and much more. This was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically it will always be when large parts of the population have difficulty at all to spend a bottle of water.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No "Showstopper" more for capital airport
Two months have been checked whether the complicated system is working in the BER bar protection. The operators are satisfied with the course, but the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is safe, said Head of Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Airport Chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful test, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have a lot of detail topics, but we don't have a real show stop." He assured that the schedule until the operation has been made up of buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The application for construction is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year it was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of shortcomings of power cables are still to be remedyed; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "To create the conditions for the inclusion of the flight operation, we must continue to work intensively on the processing of the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there is lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is no release for all dubs on which the cable terraces hang. The airport chief expects that this is available until the end of the year.
Furthermore, fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not work satisfactory. The problems had led the project three years ago to another crisis. This time it is about smoking cracks that run down in a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They are too far down. 36 engines have to be exchanged. Then there are new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree angels as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. It was originally expected to operate in 2011. The costs increased from two billion from the beginning of 2006 to approximately EUR 6.5 billion for opening the next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has risen significantly since then, the controllers are planning the development of the airport. Therefore, it is supposed to go in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as President Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial Chief Heike Fölster switches to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Staff Chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Automates for Drug - Police arrests man
He needed money for drugs - and for this he hunted some automates in the Chemnitz city area into the air! Now the offender is finally imprisoned!
Over the last two years, the number of cigarettes and cars in Chemnitz and the region had risen strongly. It was a million damage!
After two detonations, the police caught a 33-year-old German at the end of May on the civil road and on the further road in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations on the introduction of explosions of explosions in activity unit with particularly heavy case of the theft led by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, this suspicion against the 33-year-olds was not only confirmed."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now stood eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the probe he apparently financed his drug dependence."Only, the bomber had sprinkled parking cars on the civil road between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The automotive boss is now investigating. Police investigations against him continue to run.
It seems that he was also responsible for further automations in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group embraces its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the pricing struggle with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa daughter AUA "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna" confirmed on Friday a press speaker of Austrian Airlines to the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported about it.
The Vienna Base of the Lufthansa Billy Flyer Eurowings is de facto dissolved. From the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. The AUA will take over from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed, which are intended to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines for holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over from Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings Base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA-Drehkreuz and the network planning, explains the speaker. The flight times should be voted on connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the turning cross of Vienna and, on the other hand, to expand decentralized traffic from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna should only be used as a "Production Company" for the Group Sister AUA. This would include Barcelona and Rome with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and air passengers are from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number are no longer completed in Terminal 1, but in Terminal 3 as the AUA.
On Thursday, the Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced that the fleet in Vienna would increase to 16 airplanes next summer. The Irish cheap flighter sends four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticized as a conspiracy of the collective contract.
The Ryanair-Chef Michael O'Leary, who will have taken the AUA over five years, met on Friday AUA board Andreas Otto: "We stay the number one at the location, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now married the last of the four. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) was supposed to have stopped by his friend Princess Beatrice (31), who announced the palace on Thursday.
"We are delighted to be able to announce our engagement. We both are so pleased to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be actually married," said the couple, who have been together in British media reports since October 2018, in the official communication.
And further, "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us in the coming years full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photographs have published her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also immediately on her Instagram account.
A royal festival
The wedding is supposed to take place in 2020. For more information about the date, location and everything else, the palace will be announced in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne sequence and the real estate mogul becomes a similar big feast as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart weakness or an attack? Hamburg researchers want to look closely at the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to get the causes of cardiovascular diseases more detailedly.
The research project is the largest of this type in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) informed on Friday. The Kühne Foundation promotes the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain Hospital is part of the Foundation and the Zurich University Hospital.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the essential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only inadequately known. Now, scientists want to compare the complete inheritance of 8000 healthy people with the 1,000 former patients of the Universitary Heart and Faculty Centre at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4000 of the around 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-related changes in DNA - so-called mutations - from the clinic. Each year about 200 would be added.
The aim of the five-year project is to the initiators to develop new options such as precautions, detection and treatment of heart rate disorders, heart weaknesses and heart attacks. The data could also help in researching other people's diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the Universitary Heart and Faculty Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney and cancer are possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is a strong will to use the data for researching other diseases. The Foundation's clinic in Davos has so far dealt mainly with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine was to be established and a professor of bioinformatics was created at the medical campus in Switzerland. For the reason of his commitment, the logistics company living in Switzerland said that he was operating in the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and was very grateful.
The organic samples of healthy participants are from Hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 volunteers, this is the world's largest local health study according to the Clinicum. In strictly respecting the protection of the anonymousized data, the scientists insured. It is a petabyte (1000 terabyte) on data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
Today, according to UKE, the inheritance of a person can be decrypted within 24 hours. The pure cost of this is 1300 euros. The first gene sequence worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study should start on 1 October, all 9000 samples are expected to be analysed at the end of 2020. In the following year, the first results will be expected.
Nigerian police liberated hundreds of maltreated boys
In Nigeria, the police left more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a coran school. According to indications of residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims in part still underaged, as police speakers Yakubu Sabo told. "The victims were abused. Some of them said that they were raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys had been held under the pretext to be taught in the Koran and "bettered". Indeed, the shooters had been held by their teachers under "dearest and inhumanest conditions", Sabo said. Some hundred students, including children at the age of nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran school had been in the past for about ten years. Inhabitants would have made the authorities aware of repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran School, Sabo said. They hadn't thought of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
There are many private coran schools in the mostly Muslim north of Nigeria. They replace the often inadequate state facilities. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed bands. According to the UN refugee aid, over the past ten months, more than 40,000 people fled over the border in the neighbouring state of Niger.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police freed 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria freed almost 400 students from distressable conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that pointed to torture," said police speaker Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after an indication in a Islamic school. The conditions there were "human invaluable" and the officials took the head of the school and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were kept at their school as slaves and were placed on chains. Some were sexually abused. TV images showed devastated and injured students in an apparently poor state of health.
World Football Choice: More accusations of Messi and Klopps Short
Football "Signal Not Valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent
With a Gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he never voted with the World Football election, from other countries, accusations come to the Fifa. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
Many things at the Fifa have proved to be appealing in recent years: the WM-providations, dubiosis plans of her president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt functionaries. However, the Fifa World Football election has not been suspicious to run unsure - if one does not see that the voted national trainers and national team captains of the member associations often vote for sympathy rather than for objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inevitables are now happening: Egypt complained that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly recognized poll.
The Fifa apologizes that "the signatures were given to the electoral forms in capital letters and therefore were not valid" in so far as the Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's Trainer also surprised
Even from Sudan, there is a revelation about the choice. While the situation in the case of Egypt is reluctant, the Sudanese association indicates that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. However, Fifa says that the vote was the same, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera also raised accusations: "Don't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
From the association now came the message on Friday: Stimmt, but of course it was not intention. The full election documents were "irrely" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguian selection, was labeled in a communication of the association. However, actually the second captain Manuel Rosas had chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," said the message. Both Rosas and Mannschaftstrain Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "as it stands in the official list of the FIFA".
The other cases now allow the Fifa to examine in an investigation, but stressed that the election process was supervised externally by the consultative company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi stays unanswered winner of the World Football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukraine-Affair: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two ranked Republicans have spoken openly for an official investigation against the US presidents and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the US State of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this is carried out from here, the facts that are identified are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affairs before taking measures.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian president Wolodymyr Selenskyj to examine the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott observed Trump Biden "since years".
The Republicans have been reluctant with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower's affairs, but few have shown dissatisfaction for this. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's Party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned several times against Trump's policy, for example against the halting of environmental regulations and the strengthening of immigration regulations.
As another ranked Republicaner, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the congress is now to examine the matter and to go to the ground."
Scott and Baker, as governor of the U.S. federal states, have formally no consent in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided by the Congress. Their statements are especially symbolic. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also criticized the situation. In the middle of Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". US media also report that among the Republicans are taking up internally first cracks.
The affairs could in the initiation of an official settlement procedure against Trump, the Democrats in the Representative House have announced an investigation, and they present power abuse to him for foreign influence for their own political advantages.
There is no exact timetable for the procedure to be taken in the Office. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impediment. However, the decision on an actual official appeal fell in the Senate, where Trumps Republicans have the majority. The prospects for such a procedure are therefore low. To date, no US President has yet been dismissed by an impedment process of the Office.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Sicilia, they were supposed to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 lybian refugees on board unauthorized the port of Lampedusa. After severe protests and international criticism - also by Austria’s Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was revoked by an Italian judge after a few days.
Now, new serious accusations of rackets are being made loud. Three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been captured in a recording camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognised their peers in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not even have any certain information about it," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer der Deutschen Presseagentur.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even molested. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically shaken and exposed to grudges - by repeated and constant physical violence," said the message then.
NGO and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They're coming without passports," said Neubauer. Fold is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. It is therefore very likely that they're also on the ships. "It's therefore very important that this will be followed."
Italy's former minister Matteo Salvini asked Rackete, who is still found in Italy for aid to illegal immigration, immediately to apologize.
Musk seeks delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given strong boost to his electric car group with the view to new record numbers on the stock exchange.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100.000 deliveries," wrote Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the "Electrek" industry blog.
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks newsletter. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customership. Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Attorneys liked this: Teslas shares went out of trade with a plus of over six percent. The course has not been awarded for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95,000 cars and thus achieved its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver 360,000 to 400.000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be made in the current and next quarter of the year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the margins of profit are low. Despite the tree there were last losses.
US Budget dispute: Again only one bridge financing
The new financial year will start in the USA on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate has followed the Representative House on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in the expenditure limits for the financial year 2020 and 2021, the United States are once again voting before the new financial year beginning on 1 October. The Senate has followed the Representative House on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, a shutdown would be made on Monday at midnight, a part of the Federal Administration.
Shutdown turned off
The Federal Administration will now be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 at the end of Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 expenditure laws which are allocated to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the budgetary framework for the new financial year of 1.3 Bio. to 1.3.$ extended.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the expenditure laws reflect priorities of the Democrats, which have little chances in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. The Senate also has more or less prepared ten of the twelve expenditure plans, which are barely multiplicable.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to try to force $12 billion for the construction of walls, one of the great priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are disturbing the wall plans and their financing, which is intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute about the construction of walls was already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The spirits are separated in the wall construction
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue, and more likely than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also a shutdown is then not excluded.
Against the background of the persistent inability of the Congress to agree in time on the twelve expenditure laws, and the risk of shutdown gains ideas for automation of the process of popularity. Template S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the federal administration's financing would automatically continue at the previous level, undermine the parliamentarians' travel activity and hold their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are presented.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is intended to be open to single women and lesbians in the future: The National Assembly of Paris voted with a large majority for the government's legislative template, which enables all women to use in vitro fertilization, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous seed donations.
The presentation still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that many "children without father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which defenses health minister Agnès Buzyn as a "Chance" for society. It represents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to their idea, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women should be borne by social insurance.
Befruitment with sperm of dead husband continues banned
On the other hand, with a scarce majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which widows should have access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany there were cases in the past, in which women were in vain complaining of the release of the sperm of a deceased. The opponents of the ancestors in Paris argued that such a child was born to bear a "specially heavy fate".
Many members of the government party La Républicique en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and opposition representatives had expressed themselves, on the other hand, for artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed a "double grief" if the death of her husband remained unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment think it is unjust that a widow can be fruited with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner in the future.
Until now, artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heteroseksuele couples that cannot bear children. They have to be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that the body mothership continues to remain banned.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - yet it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation payment for the climate: calls for flight surcharge for Unis become louder
This is why the country wants to make a climatic deduction in the future. The scientists say they don't have any money for it, but now they are also under pressure.
The universities should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on a climate-taking on universities and universities before the summer break is again in motion. After the National Rectoral Conference has reacted skeptically to a corresponding foregoing from the green-black coalition, the plans are now given support from the universities. In a joint declaration, doctoral students from six bathing-wouded mountain universities and a pedagogical university for a compensation of service flights at the same time. This is the first step "reasonably necessary", at the same time there has to be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, it says in their opinion. The government decision originally planned in July is still on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia is taking a new festival of North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the arrested were supposed to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a change of shot between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Koreans were injured, the fishermen later suffered his severe injuries. But this time there were no injuries, it was said.
The Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were thus travelling in Russian high-quality waters. The Russia Coast Guard Station is travelling according to its own information on the protection of their marine resources patrols.
30,000 ink fish confiscated
30,000 ink fish were discovered and confiscated on the boats during the renewal of the controls. In addition, the data on three fishermen and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Naodka and Posjet at Wladivostok.
Russia's fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year after claims from native entrepreneurs. According to thousands of fishermen from North Korea, media have already been arrested in this year.
The Chief of the Association of Russian Fisheries in the Far Eastern Region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These were also taken from the sea. Furthermore, the networks would simply be disposed of in the sea where they used 200 years to be crushed.
In future only 18,000 more: USA lower asylum limits
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is dismissing protective seekers: As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington confirms, the ceiling for legal refugees is further lowered. In future, asylum is to receive threatened believers and Iraqi asylum.
The U.S. government intends to reduce the historically low limit for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, there will be a maximum of 18,000 people, as the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated. In the now almost expired marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically lowered the willingness of hosting seekers from all over the world in recent years.
The peak of 18,000 refugees is the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee programme in 1980. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs still referred to the US as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation which strongly reminds the language use of the U.S. President.
A "responsible association" with refugees aimed at returning refugees to their home countries to help rebuilding, Trump said. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives a lot of consent from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A great point of dispute is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to lock off. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a timely link between the current measure and the current internal policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affairs and a potentially threatening procedure.
The U.S. government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thereby in danger, as is shown in the Declaration of the Foreign Ministry. However, from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, there are to be a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The US wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "northful triangle" in Central America are applying asylum in other countries. In this context, the United States have only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to impede the immigration at the US southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release from Orang-Utan from Zoo to
An Orang-Utan-Weibchen has been transferred to a "Sandra" (born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986) to the rights of a "non-human person" in the former zoo of Buenos Aires. The animal was taken by direct flight to Dallas on Thursday evening, but not as a passenger, but in the freight room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human efficiency are not able to adapt to the life in the wilderness, it is supposed to live in the outskirts of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more orang-outans and 31 sjimpans, among them "Bubbles", formerly pet by Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before the entry into Florida, "Sandra" has to continue a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" has been endeavored in 2014 by animal protectors to help convert the zoo from Buenos Aires into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education site is intended to develop to preserve the variety of species.
Record for Swiss extreme mountain climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Dani Arnold extreme mountain climber has been lucky at the almost 3,000 meters of the Great Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without network, double soil or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Zinne in a new record time.
Clothed with Jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness-freeness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise. So he underbade the old brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder at Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
In spite of the trade conflict with China, the US sports product manufacturer Nike has booked a significant profitplus. The net profit increased to EUR 1.4 billion in the past quarter (knapp 1.3 billion). This is 25 percent more than in the previous years, as the Group reported on Tuesday. In particular, the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor turns directly to its customers online.
The sales increased to 10.7 billion dollars during the three-month period to the end of August. Most strongly, the Nike sales figures increased with a plus of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to directing directly to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People's Republic.
Finance Chief Andy Campion announced that with strategic investment, Nike would continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. The investors responded to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has banned a lifelong stadium against a fan. The defendant from Brazil had been smashed by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Stolz to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has played at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded late Thursday. He reported the fan's account at Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma adherents never again can visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in the Italian football. Italian fans regularly scann racist insults against black players rivalizing teams. "We can't have a racism in society or sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw out of the stages," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. On the occasion of the statement, racist songs were at the firstliga party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on the last Sunday.
However, also around Juventus Turin's adherents, there have been last discussions. The Italian authorities have now invested 38 peripheral fans of recordmaster Juventus Turin with the bans of stadiums. Four of them are supposed to no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police notified. Thus, for the others, prohibitions of four to seven years apply.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-favoured groups in the context of Juventus. Among other things, the twelve are provoked to severe expression, money laundering and private violence. The club had rolled the investigations with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are supposed to sit behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "controlled militaryly" the ticket trade for the fankurve and should have pushed Juventus employees to get to cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennials are narcistic, the generation Z is political - all of the years are covered with tangible names. If you look more precisely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This call officially launched the crab catch at the Gucheng-See in Gaochun on September 21, which also launched the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee Department.
Gaochun, which forms the southern runner of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions in ecological terms with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The magnificent natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people in Gaochun have already begun with crab breeding in the early 1990s. Over the past years, the crab industry has developed into a prestigious industry that has made high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively striving for a large, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding and technology-based crab breeding. And the city has been struggling to promote more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has made a reform to "distribute power, optimization of administration and government services" and has developed with care the service network for "accessions under a roof, a team for criminal prosecution, a network of services, a platform for credit grants", which aims to optimize the environment for authorisations, services and development.
Gaochun fully exploits the local advantages of connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as excavators to place intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedicine and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health sectors, as well as farms for ecological agriculture leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national, all areas of tourism and tourist areas of national importance. The ecological and cultural resources of the landscape of Gaochun have been integrated, the state of buildings for civil service and the public service, the areas "Tourism +" and "+ tourism" and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of the sanctions - Trump contradicts
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN Assembly, spoke of a alleged offer from the United States for abolishing sanctions. The United States, in return to talks with the Teheran leadership, had put an end to all sanctions, Ruhani explained on its official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian official on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift up the sanctions imposed against him, so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had made it possible for a meeting to take place. "And America says that I lift up the sanctions," added Ruhani. The kind of penalties that should be terminated had been held at the debate. "And they clearly said that we lift all sanctions up."
However, this incident has not been made in an acceptable manner, Ruhani criticized. In view of the current criminal measures and the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron had the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump, like Merkel on the edge of the UN Assembly.
Violent earthquakes near Istanbul - Almost 200 legs
After Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short time, fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the dawn on the previous day there have been almost 200 deaths, the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This increases the concern of a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shocked the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the million metropolis. Now the government wanted to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for legs, Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the last danger is always ignored. Every year, badly built housing crashes - among other things made by the many smaller earthquakes that Istanbul regularly shake.
For years, city planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have warned that large open areas that have been registered as refugees in the centre have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük-Bebens in August the Istanbul building chamber had warned that an estimated million buildings in Istanbul are not earthquake-proofed.
The epicentre of the dawn of Thursday was located in the Marmarameer in front of the District of Silivri and in about seven kilometres of depth, as the Afad Civil Protection Authority reported. A little bit later, an even larger panic was provided on the streets.
The Istanbulian mayor Ekrem Imamoglu told on Twitter that injured or damage had not been reported at first. The State Sender TRT showed people who ran out of the houses panic. Students were brought out of the buildings for security reasons in the District Silivri. Some students wept as to see pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth Plate. Turkey is repeatedly shocked by earthquakes. One of the most fatal was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17.000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake could threaten the strength of 7.1 to 7.4. But when it comes to the earthquake is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday it already met the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have packed so-called Go bags with all the need to stand next to home doors, and schools teach children as they have to bear when the earth waxes. When the next big legs come, be unclear.
The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slightly damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments from the Istanbul Civil Coordination Centre (Akom). According to its information, two minarettes of Mosques crashed into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warnings for legacy in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of panic report. Buildings were wake up. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It had been stronger than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Hospital, warned from retirement via Twitter. He called the people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official information, the date of the occupation is given at 13.59 p.m. (local time). Just a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a poster with a strength of 4.0 on the scale of judges.
It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of strength 4.6 had shocked the Turkish Marmara region - it was to feel until Istanbul. Its epicentre was also located in the Marmara Lake west of the million metropolis, the Afad disaster protection authority announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that provided for headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that soon or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tektonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually escape and cause massive damage.
The earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It was more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to the broadcaster. "From now or later, the great quake will come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the quake also triggered great concerns in Istanbul. In Albania there had been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injuries. Also this year the earth had been occupied at the ground sea.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine
Two brilliant documents provide for new ignorants in Ukraine for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official survey procedure, the US Democrats are strengthened: The complaint about Trump and its controversial phoneat with the Ukrainian President, submitted by an anonymous notifier, with important evidence for investigations against the Presidents. Trump itself is once more a victim of a "hexen hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in Toilet - Flyer redirected
Because a passenger was imprisoned in the board toilette, a flight was redirected by United Airlines. The WC door had been blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the 1554 flight, the airline reported US media.
In an extra-planned intermediate landing on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the close cabin. About an hour if she had been locked in it, US media wrote to other passengers under appeal. To continue flight towards San Francisco, the passengers had to switch the machine.
In a video that is to be used on the Internet, according to US media from Flight 1554, a number of people are trying to free the woman. "We are working on opening the door, Ma'am. We will soon get you out, OK?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all passengers. Open was first if the woman receives compensation.
The Kakerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is invisible.
The British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in Great Britain, inspired by Franz Kafkas.
The novel "The Cakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenee Verlag (Türich) shared it with the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but now at once is the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people and is wildly determined to let nothing and nobody stop.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If the Parliament is closed, so that the government can not be challenged in a critical moment when Ministers lie as shamelessly as once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers in high positions borrowed the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask what he can do. There is only an answer to it: write." By McEwan was only appeared in the spring of the novel "Maschinen like me".
Kafkas, published in 1915 for the first time, is by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees "to a tremendous disgusting beast" and is gradually excluded from family and society and is finally undergone. "Ian McEwan tends to describe a world that is headed," said the Diogene Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary get whistle brakes to reduce noise load through freight trains. In addition, sections of rail connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna's new town and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
This is intended to make travels more comfortable according to the EU authorities and reduce CO2 emissions.The funds come from the EU Infrastructure Summit "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels canceled until 31.October
The German travel organizer Thomas Cook has canceled all the journeys for one day after his insolvency until 31 October 2019. Travel could "not be taken out of insolvency reasons," the company informed on Thursday evening.
This also involves bookings from Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Bookers Travel and Air Marin, which have already been paid or fully paid. As it is about travelling starting from 1 November 2019, the company opened up. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further approach was examined.
Thomas Cook in Germany was in the sog of the Pleite of the British Mother Group and had put insolvency on Wednesday. The company, among other things Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Bucher Travel, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer hotels immediately again money
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently still house Thomas-Cook holidays, will receive money from the Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are, according to Zurich, subject to the condition that vacationers are no longer required for extra payments.
On the basis of booking information and without submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and subject to the condition that Thomas-Cook-Reisende from these hotels will not be promptly requested or otherwise required for individual payment of hotel accounts," spokesperson Bernd Angelia continued.
The insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who had been compelled to pay their local accommodations on their own. Some therefore had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had criticized this sharply.
As many hotels are affected, the insolvent traveller will vote on Friday, said the insurance speaker. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschalurlauber from Germany were travelling. Zurich Germany has secured holidays and return to the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels through the Zurich insurance only help the travellers who are currently on the trip. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly in the holidays, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company informed that all travels would be canceled until including 31 October. This is also valid for such bookings that have already been paid.
As it is about traveling with start from 1 November 2019, the company opened up. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further approach was examined, it said. In principle, the insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroyed Spengmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry continues the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he now walks directly on the tracks of his mother.
The British Prince Harry in Angola was clothed with a blue splitter protection west and destroyed a sponge mine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trusts at Dirico's place on Friday morning before running TV cameras, he made the ignition circle. In a safe distance, the sprinkler exploded in the savann landscape without any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100.000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mines that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African trip, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explosive champion, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to leave the way she went back at that time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious mine field in 1997 went around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip in the South African tourist metropolis.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The risk of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Premier Boris Johnson has clearly decided: with him there will be no guarantee of a third lift of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are already in the polarising British of eternal duration. The latest judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain has been canceled as a Damoclesheart over the Blondschopf. His suspension of the Parliament, in order to continue its Brexit course until the date of departure, has been canceled at the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament obliges Johnson to bring an extension of bilateral talks to the EU until 31 October.
Boris Johnson still thinks Deal is possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass by Johnson. In the meantime, when visiting a hospital of Andeutungen, he supported the negotiations by the end of October in the event of a non-announcement:
You know, we're going to keep the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I am carefully optimistic that it works.
And the time slows down to the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. For about six weeks, the EU and the British negotiators have time to avoid the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union without agreements. However, the recent talks have not reached a breakthrough again. An agreement by the end of October seems more difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not breach the law, there is another shift of the date of departure in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words. She fears that Johnson may at some point implement Brexit in the case of a no-deal.
US Authority: Other deaths by e-cygarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cygarettes in the USA has increased to twelve. Furthermore, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, the US Health Authority informed CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 persons concerned, confirmed about 500 of them. The cause of pulmonary damage is still totally unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in pulmonary damage has been known until now.
The fear of new protests grows in Egypt
Millions of times, Mohammed Ali's videos were divided into online networks. The Spanish builders and actors call for a "volks revolution". For today's Friday, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military to which critics of corruption and misconduct. Ali hopes for mass admissions with a million participants in central squares of the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Cairos, a stronger police presence was already observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets were locked around the central Tahrir square. In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for messages and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
During the past weekend, there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), there were almost 2000 people arrested since last week. Many of them were randomly arrested - just because they were "on the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW shared arresters in charge of lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general ruled the country since 2013 after crashing the democratically elected islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Greenland Expedition back
Arved Fuchs was returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburg Harbour, among others by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg with the racing yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had examined and documented the consequences of the heating on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. For years he waited for the young generation to speak. For decades, you know that the earth was warming. Nevertheless, many were as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often happening under public exclusion," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of the heating and the irrigation of the seas. Among other things, the expedition was measured with a drone of Greenland's glaciers and was fished with networks to microplastics.
For his "Fight for Sustainable and Respectful Use of the World Seas", the Polar Researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the context of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who are at the heart of the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great model," said Skipper Boris Herrmann during the award. "He is a witness of the changes that have occurred in the Arctics over the past decades."
Teure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for nudels 430 Euro
430 Euros for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant close to Englishburg in Rome: that seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. Although the bill of 80 euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Solche cases harm the prominence of Rome. We call on the police to ask whether this is a fraud," asked a spokesman of Federagit, the association of the guide in Rome, according to the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero (Freeday edition).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women would not only order Spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not to be taken from the invoice. Also a drinking fee of up to 20 percent of the invoice is normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could have been actually confronted with an official survey procedure after the turbulent unveilings of the past days, the Democrats want to examine it with their investigation in the House of Representatives now as quickly as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the scandal, the liaison with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is supposed to stand up. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who brought the talk of concern for national security and for US democracy with its complaint, is demonstrative: the President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the election of 2020. He has depressively exploited Ukraine's dependence and thus forced them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also reflected in the now published communication of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not render the full text. However, the telephone of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger history, in which the centre next to Trump is primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes its start from view of the public in May 2019, when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis reports travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly chosen president Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very accurately that his intentions are delicate. "We do not mix into a choice, we mix ourselves into an inquiry of what we have the right," he says to the newspaper. One could think it is inappropriate, but "this is nothing illegal". Giuliani wants to be pursued in Ukraine investigations for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information will be very helpful for my clients and can turn out as helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former Mayor of New York seemed to have infected with right conspiracy fantasia, fixed on Trump's counter-kandidat at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, said critics at that time to construct an occasion for Russia's releases in the USA. However, this warranty was never to take seriously.
It is precisely about the investigations that the Trump will speak so prominently to Selenskyj in July. The version of Giulianis and the president is: The former Vice President and currently inspectible candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has forced as a Ukrainian officer of the Obama government to release the former Ukrainian general attorney Wiktor Schokin. And, in order to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible by him, his son Hunter Biden was acting in its supervisory council. Biden Senior has financed Ukraine to confiscise the corrupt powers of his family.
In fact, when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian general prosecutor should go, the investigation against the gas company was already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also provoked to deeply corrupt gestures, the US government was by far not the only Western partner who urged his release. By the way, the Obama government even specifically supported the investigations against the company.
Disorders with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances with Instagram and Facebook. Thus, mainly Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. On the website all disturbances.de users report that Facebook has not been loading again and again since 15.30 p.m. Instagram also gives an error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disorder, although not in the same range.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disorders
It is not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, the services were out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also take this time especially back on Twitter to make their anger air.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been saved from the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were travelling with a hose boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in trouble - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue scrub for the mountain.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m., we received the message, just about 10 a.m. we started, and good 20 minutes we were over the hose boat."
Poland has been working on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers have been safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NOT charged wireless
Practical but harmful
Although inductive technology via Qi-standard is extremely practical, however, should not be used.
Since most recently several new smartphones have come to the market, which support wireless charges and sell themselves very well - all the new iPhone 11 models before, we want to remember a study from the beginning of July. Although the wireless store of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Increased temperature accelerates battery
Researchers warn against the wireless loading of smartphones. This is, according to the findings of the University of Warwick, extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the much greater heating development. If a mobile phone is loaded normally by cables, the battery is heated within three hours to 27 degrees. During the wireless loading, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees in perfect orientation of the smartphone on the charging path. If the mobile phone is a little close to the spine, the temperature is even higher. Furthermore, the watt strength of the charging paths increases, which resumes the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for battery durability is a decisive factor. Every single degree plays a role. In loading with higher temperatures, the battery does not only affect capacity, but it does not keep as long as a whole. So the lifetime is lower. Therefore, the researchers recommend that the smartphone is always charged with cables. Since a battery exchange is always connected with high cost in modern smartphones, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of battery exchange even once again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is very comfortable:Simply put the device on an appropriate charging path - they are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is loaded without a harsh cable salad and a timid plug-in flame. Since Qi (standing for inductive energy transmission) is a global standard, which makes Apple almost even, there are hardly limitations. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest boot photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
According to its own information, a Nepalese mountain climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, his expedition organizer informed.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international headlines: from him a photo of mountain climbers that are on Mount Everest Snake in the spring comes from it.
The image of the mass rank triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 metres high mountain and the highest peak of the earth. In May, 11 climbers died in the vicinity within a few days.
A problem for Purja could become the bribe of the 14th eight thousand: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet. Among other things, it is called bad weather. In the early week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to enable him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a thirsty elephant cow, a police speaker informed on Friday. "We suspect that the elephant was poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police speaker, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to detect the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers in whose country the animals had kept themselves inadequate. At the same time, about 50 people are killed each year by elephants. This is usually happening when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. Her killing is theoretically the death penalty.
Continuing British oil tank leaves Iran
The British oil anchor "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas for more than two months after its establishment by Iran. According to the news agency IRNA, the Irish revolutionary warrants had set the tanker driving under British flag on July 19, under the prescribed dismissal of the rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Criticism
The responsible economic committee of the sub-house wants to examine the leadership of the traveller Thomas Cook. It is intended to deal with the salary packages of the board as well as with the question why the British government could not contribute financially to the surviving company. "Our interest is the supervision of the company as well as the control of external account auditors," said the chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "Oftently we have to do so with a bad example of management desire".
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of the genes in the family increased risk of intestinal cancer has apparently been overestimated. Accordingly, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) in a current study are more likely to consider this. Other risk factors such as family diet habits are more difficult than ever. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of intestinal cancer, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) from the "Electrek" industry blog. The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, if it continues in Musks newsletter.
The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customership. Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
investors enjoyed the information: Teslas shares went out of the trade with a plus of more than six percent. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95'000 cars and thus achieved its best value.
Musk needs records in order to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be made in the current and next quarter of the year. The most affordable Tesla Model 3 is demanded, but here are the margins of profit. Despite the tree there were last losses.
Will the British Government handle Brexit law? Johnson retaining
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, considers whether he is looking for an unregulated Brexit on the grounds of a reversal of the last law adopted by Parliament. On a question he said only on Friday before journalists that his government will comply with the applicable law.
The law provides for the government to request a shift in the date of withdrawal, no EU agreement should be reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a 'capitulation law' which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspicion on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political arbitration" in order to transpose the law. Johnson could use a procedure trick that shifts the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said he seeks a Treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the agreement."
Iran seems to drive up uranium enrichment
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on European contracting partners in the dispute about the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "The European States show incapacity or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference at the edge of the UN Assembly in New York. In case they did not stand for their promises, he set aside "more steps" from the agreements of the toughly negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict around the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, as a counterpart, made the commitment to teheran to normalise economic relations. In 2018, the US alone rose out of the agreement to force Iran with "maximal pressure" to change the course in the aggressive Nahost Policy. The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with harder conditions and now renews to severe sanctions against Teheran. Iran responded to it with a re-establishment of the uranium enrichment restricted in the Treaty.
In a report, the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed that the Islamic Republic now uses the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September, or has at least prepared for use. According to IAEA statements, Iran also prepares the construction of more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore let the Iranians with the cost and burden of pressing U.S. sanctions alone, suspicious Rohani. However, there will still be further talks that hopefully have a solution.
Rohani continues Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the volume has changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US estimate that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels in Yemen supported by Iran had known themselves for the attack, which was considered false by the USA. "We have nothing to do with it," said Rohani on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such accusations must make evidence of this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders in the discussions with him during the UN General Debate did not have to consent. Instead, they would only have called on that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out such an attack as these. Rohani had hit himself with the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible discussions with US President Trump, Rohani demanded that the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration be lifted. He called on the government in Washington to change a policy of dialogue and reason.
Comet from other star crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the deepest of the world. This was one time before. The comet allows conclusions to other solar systems.
At first, what was only a suspicion is now confirmed: An interstellary guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of the space was baptized to 2I/Borisov after his discovery and has awakened the interest of astronomers around the world.
The widespread comet was discovered on August 30th by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory on Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters diameter. Observations of different observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not come from our solar system.
2I/Borisov, after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017, is the second interstellary object that has been seen during a passion of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get out of the proximity of insight into a foreign solar system before it disappears from never-review. First observations show that the interstellary comet is similar to that of our own systems, as the astrophysical Institute of Canary Islands reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that are around the sun," said Davide Farnocchia from the US Racing Authority Nasa in a communication.
According to the Commission's analysis on a so-called hyperbel line that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellary origin, as reported by the International Astronomic Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discovery, the interstellar sliding star, which was first led under Catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was the name 2I/Borisov, showing the first part of the name that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers have lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been faced in flight. Thus, researchers remain many months for investigations. "The object will reach the largest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "Therefore, it will only be seen with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already taken the visitors into sight. A team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, set the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometres in a first investigation. Records of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear slip of the comet.
Researchers from the Kanarian Institute of Astrophysics (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellary sliding star that offers a type of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles such as comets of our solar system, and that points out that their composition must be similar", reports IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation lays near that comets in other solar systems could form themselves through similar processes as in our, complemented the León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of just two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such stippieviss are, it is still difficult to assess. One of the next interstellar visitors might take off a planned satellite mission from the Esa European Space Agency.
The Agency intends to station the three-part "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example comets catch hunters) on a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres away from the earth. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is intended to listen to either a fresh comet from our own solar system, or to an interstellary visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijings new Mega-Airport Daxing
Interestingly before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic, it is available: On the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines is landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are expected to be completed annually at the new airport, in 2025 it is already 72 million. China’s president Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s latest Prestige project is also called "Seester" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four starting and landing trains to be extended later to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-new subway transports passengers to the city centre of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
During the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly made clear that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany – and much smaller – since 2006 in Germany has been relocated. In Beijing, however, a first passenger machine has landed after four years.
New flies are intended to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the UK Space Agency dreams of the UK Space Agency. It is possible to make this, for the 2030s, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company developed Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the US-Sender CNNN the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely achieve it," said Agent Graham Turnock to the broadcaster. "We speak of the 2030s for the operation, and the work has already been very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to cooperate with the Australian more closely. A flight from the British capital to Australian Metropole takes about 20 hours. As so far, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the stop of its operation in 2003 and used three to three and a half hours for it. In 2000, an accident occurred during the launch of a Concorde at the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 inmates were killed. Last year, the US aircraft builder Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a surplus airplane to the "X Plan". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Saber will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transfer," writes Reaction Engines, among other things on his homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. Furthermore, such aircraft can also be used outside the earth's atmosphere and allowing the "nearest generation to be truly reusable respiratory devices".
Revocation in Washington: Trump wants to find anonymous typifiers in Ukraine affairs
Donald Trump wants to discover possible ugly places in the White House in Ukraine for possible abuse of power by the US president.
"I want to know who has given the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday before employees of the United Nations Society in New York. The person concerned is almost "a spy" and it was "a bit different" in the past than today.
This was evaluated as an intimidation attempt against typifiers. The event was actually not public. However, several US media spread audio media from the talk on Friday. Democrats responded displeased to the President's statement.
The Democrats in the US Representative House had announced on Tuesday preparations for an official appeal against Trump. Their accusations were primarily based on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service staff who raised heavy accusations against Trump and its government centre. On large public pressure, the notices of the notifier were published on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government staff, which the US President "uses the power of his office" in order to ensure that another country is involved in the U.S. election 2020.
In the center of the accusation, a controversial telephone between Trump and Ukrainian president Wolodymyr Selenskyj was encouraged by Trump to investigate his colleagues who could harm his political rival Joe Biden. In this connection, Biden's son Hunter's former business in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his pronouncement from Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race around the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine telephonate of excursion: executive members of the government had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic texting protocol was produced. This had been removed from a database which was normally intended for this purpose and was stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a gross conversational protocol has been published.
The identity of the notifier is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it was supposed to be a staff of CIA's foreign secret service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called Whistleblower" had spread information from second hand that had proved to be inappropriate. Therefore, there may not be any tippers or spies.
As Trump said in New York about those who had supposedly played information to the Whistleblower, however, rebelled. The president of the US Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, responded and complained, Trump’s statement undermined the integrity of the government once more.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations against Trump and its surroundings have been carried out in several committees for months. In view of the Ukrainian preambles, the Democrats are now leading up investigations with new weight in order to initiate a possible investigation against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a driving plan for our investigation," said the Chief of the Secret Service Committee at the Representative House, Adam Schiff. Trump tightly attacked ship, prompted him a false presentation of things and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly deprived ships and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government staff from the security and external policy sector, who were engaged in a majority of democratic, but also under the Republican presidents, were present in a declaration published on Friday on the basis of the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible interrogation procedure. If the accusations were true, Trump would be the "scrupulous abuse of power", it said.
There is no exact timetable for the further process. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual official settlement fell in the Senate, where Trumps Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for such a procedure are low. To date, no U.S. President has yet been dismissed by an impedment procedure of the Office.
VW Operations Council: Jobs are "slipping"
The VW's plans to further reduce the cost in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is about the company council of the Autobauer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros, and it is intended to save 500 million euros this year.
The "Court Pact" negotiated between companies and business councils in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14.000 jobs alone in Germany by 2020. In principle, a job can only be dismantled with the car builder if it is demonstrated that the activities associated with it are no longer required. In addition, employment assurance is applicable until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from business councils, jobs in production, which are not actually disposing, are "slipping" down on a different path - so on the official course. Thus, free-going regular jobs would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the Board of Appeal has no way to force the re-establishment. In the meantime, there is a lack of personnel in many places to increase labour poisoning, the concerns of a gradually bleeding of the vehicle plants would be greater. Thus, the fear that the vehicle production could be deducted from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. By VW, it was only said: "A adjustment of the employment volume is as agreed socially contractively along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and control new projects centrally. This also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and therefore competitiveness. Production manager Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "In uncertain times, we are well advised to make ourselves crystal-resistant from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China".
In this way, there are already successes: for example, this year since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall for the first time compared to the previous year. Before journalists said that the production time for the Gulf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, will shorten by 1,1 hours. Exact figures on the production duration do not call VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is at Golf 7 round
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works of Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufactured components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the Faust Rule that 800,000 cars have to be built every year so that the work is satisfactory. However, in 2018, the exploitation in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - conditioned by the falling Diesel demand and the problems in the conversion to the new consumption and exhaust gas test procedures WLTP.
However, as production board Tostmann has announced last year, in Wolfsburg a million cars are supposed to roll "perspectively" from the band. This is intended to make the bundling of golf production in the tribal work possible - because the Zwickau work, through the relocation to the location for the e-auto production, gives the golf fortification.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales numbers of Gulf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Gulf 8. It is intended to remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburger despite all efforts to build e-mobility.
Forced with Voodoo to prostitution: human dealers condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn, slipped into the Ruhr area and were forced to prostitution. Six suspicious human dealers have to be imprisoned for it.
Six suspicious merchants from Nigeria were sentenced in Bochum on Friday to grant and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months. The accused women from Nigeria had been swept into the Ruhr Area and forced to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the exilant Nigerians still had to bear a ritual swore in front of a Voodoo prize.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old, with the help of Libyan Schleusers to hose boats across the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they were distributed to various bracelets in order to compensate for the alleged cost of an average of EUR 25,000.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of young Nigerian women on boardelle in the process. "The work made it difficult to create women physically and psychically," said judge Isabel Hoffmann in the proclamation of judgment. "Some were correctly opposed".
The judgments are based on commercial and tiest inclusions of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, salaries and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the Ufo Air Conductor Company has again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "inform about the work campaigns in the LH Group on 14 October", Ufo Tarif Chairman Daniel Floor informed on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have for months refused to conduct tariff negotiations with Ufo. The question also concerns whether the trade union has legally cancelled tariff contracts at Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to find that the collective contracts were not canceled. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal. "That a second court sees the matter completely different, I think unlikely," said Ufo Board Floor.
In August Lufthansa had also submitted a request to the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt to review the Ufo status as a trade union. The company argued that the union had not been employed by a representative board for months and was not able to complete its role as a collective partner.
Previously, a strong leadership dispute in the Spartenwerkwerk, during which many members of the Board and the Board of Advisors, including the long-standing trade union chief Nicoley Baublies, were resigned. Due to the doubts of their leadership, the Ufo had been exposed to an early initial agreement on the strike of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.
Enlightened entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is supposed to change. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa destinations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030 the number of international and local visitors were to increase to 100 million a year, the Tourism Commission informed.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is one-historic moment for our country," said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chalib.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult to access tourists. Visa is usually only available for short business trips, religious Pilgrims or visitors with members in the desert state. With the new rules, the erzconservative kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September several missiles and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery of the country in Abkaik as well as the Churais oil field. In the Folge, national oil production drastically broke up, the oil prices shots at the height. It is expected to take several weeks until the production of oil from the Kingdom again reaches its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparations for wedding festival
Sänger Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for her wedding festival. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in her Instagram Stories several party photographs on which she can be seen in the white wedding view. Reality Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others, according to the People's Magazine, had organized a young girls' divorce in Los Angeles.

The beebers gave themselves the Ja-Wort in a New York State Office a year ago. A larger festival had not existed at that time.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't lead a relationship."
Two Deads at Aeroplane Absturz in the Czech Republic
Two people have died in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of Czech Republic. The wrack was discovered in a forest area in Mecin City (Metschin) on Friday, the police informed. The dead were 38 years old and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. In the search there was also a military helicopter in use. The cause of unfortunateness has yet to be determined. The crash place is about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European trees are threatened by extinction
In addition to injuries, diseases, territorial species, non-sustainable wooden beatings and the growth of cities are the causes of the threat, the World Nature Protection Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them are no other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent were threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus death.
The IUCN shares vulnerable species in six categories: from "potentially threatened" to "angered", "strongly threatened", "threatened from extinction" and "determined in nature" to "destroy out". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as threatened.
Eberish and wild roscassation threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) was particularly threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, said the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by transforming or weakening their habitats".
Badly it also looks for the wild common roscastania. They have been considered "angered" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The largest threat, besides a mushroom, represents the Balkan minimoot. It has spread from southeastern Europe over the whole continent since the 1980s and has little natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild roscastania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account in this assessment, the trees in cities, parks and solely.
Smuggles and moose also in danger
The IUCN scientists simultaneously created new European red lists for molluscs, bouquets and moose. More than one fifth of the molluscs and moose and almost half of all types of straw were threatened, IUCN said. This was mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, the swallowing of species, agricultural practices and climate change. Weights like snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the ground and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the Europe Office. "We have to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species priority."
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 Injuries reported
In Turkey, 34 people were injured during the recent earthquake. Deads were not reported. Thousands of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have thus been damaged. Since the dawn on the day before, there have been almost 200 afterlife. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shocked the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the million metropolis.
Now, the government wanted to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced that Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for legs over the past 20 years, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly hazardous to earth. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called Nordanatolic disorder marking the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth plate.
One of the worst earthquakes was one of the strengths 7,6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicentre was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17 000 people died.
On Tuesday a quake of strength 4.6 had shocked the region around Istanbul. The authorities called the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the mid-term show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will run the mid-term show of the next American football finals Super Bowl. This was known by the singers at Twitter. "It's not bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of himself and Lopez. She was arranged to stand on the Super-Bowl-Bühne. On February 2, 2020, it's going to be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said that since 1996 she dreamed of getting up at Super Bowl - then she saw Diana Ross flying in the mid-term show. "Now it's more special because the NFL exists 100 years and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She could hardly expect "to show what we can do on the largest stage of the world."
Shakira pointed out in an explanation that she feels honored to stand next to another artist on one of the largest stages around the world, representing Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it is the first time that the two "Kings" are together on a stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents came from Puerto Rico.
Fighting against falling spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the mid-term show are among the most viewed TV transfers in the USA. Even though you have recently dropped spectacle numbers: In this February, the spectacle in the USA attracted the least viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people in the cut.
Around the mid-term show of the past Super Bowl, there had been a rebellion in the front: In the dispute about the dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear in the past February media reports. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led to the mid-term show - the criticisms were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then Quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had been on the knees during the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the National Hymne of Protest against Police Force and Rassism. With his protest, Caepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This made great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked most of the Afro-American football stars. Caepernick itself has been unentrusted since March 2017 and has no NFL party. He prescribed the clubs to do not want to hang him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to be charged with the plea of the traveller Thomas Cook, according to a press report. High depreciations on outstanding bonds and loans are threatened. This also affects Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in their Friday edition.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisses would probably have to make a total depreciation of up to 1.8 billion UK pounds (about 2 billion euros), according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase depreciation from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually depreciated should be more likely to be at the top of the bandwidths, said an expert on the sheet.
The losses of the creditors will actually be at the end of the process will show itself after the insolvency procedure has expired. For example, a person close to this procedure has not sprayed too much hope. For example, the about 40 aircraft from Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the real estates are in bad situations. Most of the money can be picked out with the sale of the airport slots as well as the brand Thomas Cook, it continued.
Rackete is supposed to have brought suspicious murderers to Italy
The Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have tortured and killed in Libya. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have any secure information," said the spokesman of the Refugee Organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neubauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of rape, torture, and death in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the recording camp in the Italian Messina. New builders emphasized that the refugee organizations could not verify who they left on their ships. "They are coming without passports."
On June 29, Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa, while a ship of the Italian financial police was hampered. On the day, the three suspects were supposed to have arrived there. The captain is investigating for aid to illegal immigration.
United States warns against Huawei
The Chief of the U.S. Internet Authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the Federal Government from trusting Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large," said Pai the "Handelsblatt" with a view to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that requires each company "under Chinese law" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The applicable right also prohibits the company to inform third parties about such requests," the FCC Chief continues, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to ask suppliers for a "reliability declaration".
At first, Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" called on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billion lines of program code that change with time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "irrespective of where, it would be possible to check every single update in real time to detect safety risks," the FCC CEO continues.
To the Chinese company Huawei he presents close contacts with the Chinese state device:
The ownership relationships are transparent. The employees' company, which is supposed to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai the "Handelsblatt".
The US suggests findings that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for discussions in Berlin to recruit for the US's position.
Chemistry factory in North France burnt: schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic firewall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemistry factory. The fire is deleted after hours - but the cleaning work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's cravings remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be open precautionally on Friday, informed the competent prefecture. The Ministry of Interior had invited the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to suspend the smoke. Injured was not there. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to set the harvest first.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the deletion of smell, the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 police and gendarmen were used in the fireplace.
A gigantic black smoke pillar had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of Lubricol, the additive for oil repairs. The production plant is a few kilometres from the city centre.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, in 1976, there was a devastating chemical accident.
The prefection of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news sender BFMTV that at first no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dams were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early morning at 02.40, the authorities reported. The cause was first unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany has to invest now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, called on Germany to increase investments in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest and now, the earlier, the better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening on the presentation of the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the euro area is weakened, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation becomes worse in order to make the necessary decisions."
The countries that would have to have budget playrooms for more investment would have to act, said Le Maire, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these spaces, added the minister and pointed to the high government debt of his country. This is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French government debt has to be "stabilized" and "sent", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to make more public investments in order to experience the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get his budget deficit into control.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides tax reductions of more than EUR nine billion for households.
The French government, among other things, responds to the protests of the Yellow West movement. The new debt is expected to decrease to 2.2 percent, as expected 3.1 percent this year.
Does he still try to trick?: Johnson wipes question about Brexit-Tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson criticises the "capitulation law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribed to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a slump hole. However, on this occasion, the Tory politician deviates.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about whether he wants to carry out an irregular Brexit - despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which is to prevent exactly that.On a corresponding question, Johnson said only to journalists that his government will comply with the applicable law.
The law provides for the government to request a shift in the date of withdrawal, no EU agreement should be reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a 'capitulation law' which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspicion on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political arbitration" in order to transpose the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure trick that shifts the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he strives a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is that with an agreement."
Johnson's Chief Advisor Dominic Cummings said that he feels the political conflicts about Brexit as a "spaziergang in the park" and was confident that the desired EU exit still came into existence: "We will enjoy this, we will win, we will get out of the EU (Anm. d. Red.: from the EU), we will not worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit Campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the EU referendum in 2016, is now acting as a headquarters in Downing Street, Germany. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister to a slightly unseen situation.
The Polaroid Diary of Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diarys" (bags) deeply dives into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda's death in 1998 from 1969 to 1998, was clearly proud and proud when he presented the "The Polaroid Diaries" picture band in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrative guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretender Lady Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiary is a fleeting view of the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for the legacy of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always involved. Thousands of polaroids made it, some hundred of them are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, silent life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "They wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the heart: your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him.
He dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, calls in the bathrobe with a bag on the head or wears unshaped moon boats. Surely, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the shinlight light on her farm in southern England or in Scotland also led a very normal life. Thus, according to BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had been sleeping as a baby in a bed that had bared her father from old potato boxes. And it wasn't always cleaned up at the McCartneys.
Like barely another medium, the Poloraid camera starts the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family daybook, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the decision Click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens before you, and then you have to cut it at the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you know two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift to catch exactly the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun-Essay.
There, the light, composition, image cutting and the colors, which "The Polaroid Diaries" not only makes an entertaining image book for Beatles fans, but in addition to all anecdotics, is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes are even like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly created Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared just 50 years ago.
"We will continue buying oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country despite the U.S. sanctions imposed against Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey has problems with the import of Iranian oil, since some companies had withdrawn "because of the U.S. threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "is going to continue our relations with Iran, especially in this matter and in many other questions," said the Turkish President, who repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its exit from the International Atomic Agreement with Iran, the USA have pursued a policy of "maximal pressure" towards the Islamic Republic. According to the United States, Iran is following a nuclear program in secret and does not follow the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the breakdown of Iran's oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months the tensions in the Gulf region have intensified significantly.
U.S. government wants to restrict refugees' reception
The U.S. government intends to drastically limit refugees' reception. On Thursday, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the annual ceiling of a relocation programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the US would continue to see the support of refugees obliged, but the most important task is to protect US citizens and serve them, and the US immigration system is currently overloaded.
The U.S. government will continue to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thereby in danger, as is shown by the Declaration of the Foreign Ministry, and from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, however, to receive up to 1500 refugees.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN-Lagers are selected around the world and relocated in the USA. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the current limit of 30,000 is a lowest. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was almost 85,000.
Assistants responded to the announced reduction of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the Chief of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The USA would further damage their leading role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump tries to strictly limit the immigration into the US - legally and illegally. The US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the next budget year. These numbers are separated from the relocation programme.
Donald Trump - "Come near a tipl"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused noteers in the Whistleblower's affair of spying. Whoever has injured the informant who has given power abuse to him, "come close to a tipl," said Trump according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. It reports several US media consistently.
Accordingly, Trump spoke before employees of the U.S. UN mission. When he was asked for the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial operations in the White House, he replied: "That comes close to a tip." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we've done in ancient times when we were slim? Right. The spy and betrayed, we were doing a little different than we did now."
The observers valued the latter remark on a possible claim to the death penalty. The Democrats exercised strong criticism of Trump’s statements and proposed him intimidation of witnesses. It is also a attempt to hinder a convention investigation into a possible office trial against him, the Chairman of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisors in the Representative House wrote.
The Whistleblower is proposing to the President in a complaint that he has abused his office in order to entering another country into the U.S. election of 2020. It is in a concrete way about his controversial telephone with his Ukrainian colleague Wolodymyr Selenskyj in summer: In the conversation, Trump urged him to initiate investigations against his possible democratic publisher Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contests any misconduct.
However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower should be an analyst of CIA's foreign secret service.
Refugee boat known: Babies and small children drowned in Aegean
People are repeatedly trying to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece, often knowing the many too small boats. In the fall of a hose boat, seven migrants have now died, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants have died during the fall of a hose boat. Among the death victims, a baby and four other children were also killed, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women, and five men could therefore be saved from the flood of the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants were broken out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
From which countries the migrants are not yet known. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey pass over to the Greek islands in the East of Aegean, mostly in small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNHCR) 174 people died.
The Who Breaks Concert
A U.S. concert of the Rockband The Who has found a savage end in the middle of the appearance in Houston on Wednesday evening (local time). At the eighth song, Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it is still running."
Lead-Gitarrist Pete Townsend asked for apologize and supplemented that Daltrey could "not really speak". Townsend promised to come to his expense at a reconstruction concert, but a date is not yet established.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sundays in Denver, The Who said to be recharged at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band colleague Townsend are the only founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Suddenly hired: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork was the largest office owner.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from the small startup to the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in the crisis. Renters have to fear billions of revenue.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork threatens to disturb the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had stopped founder Adam Neumann a few days ago as a boss, shifted the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for managers to win financial room for the coming weeks and months. Among other things, the British "Financial Times", WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect, among other things, in New York and London, the largest tenant of office areas is suddenly from the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces in the long term and rents them in partly small units to members. This can be individual free-workers, small startups or whole departments of large companies. WeWork burns money with this business in breathtaking speed. Last year, the company entered a loss of $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion. In this year alone, the rental costs will have increased to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new company's management is now supposed to have pulled the emergency brake and the renting of new areas with an immediate effect.
According to the 'Financial Times', WeWork has now completed rental contracts with runtimes of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for all real estate markets.
According to the calculations of the Economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months almost 300,000 square meters of office space. WeWork's new contracts only ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly marketed areas. Without WeWork's expansion, the office space in the U.S. Metropole would have increased in this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". Similarly, in London, WeWork is looking for several dozen office locations in the best position.
Even in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be veiled without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main owner, last year by the Sparkassen-Fondsanitor Deka for almost 100 million euros in the centre of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their real estate for the demands of WeWork with high investments. WeWork does not make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would have to write down some of the expected billion revenues. Access to WeWork’s reserves, however scarce, do not, despite the long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by extra-founded subsidiaries, so-called special purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only in close limits.
Russia again took a number of North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken place against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 wildlifers who had been illegally fishing in the waters have been arrested, the Russian Inland Secret Service FSB informed the Interfax Agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. The border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it was said. The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were thus on the way in Russian court waters. The coastline of Russia travels according to its own information on the protection of their marine biological resources patrouills. In the review, 30,000 ink fish have been discovered. In addition, the information according to three fishermen and two motor boats has been confiscated and brought to Naodka and Posjet at Wladivostok. According to the Agency Ria Nowosti, in 2018, the Coast Guard Station established more than 8,000 violations.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans even after claims from native entrepreneurs. According to 2019, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested in the media.
The Chief of the Association of Russian Fisheries in the Far Eastern Region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic networks prohibited in Russia. They also took small livestock from the sea. Furthermore, the networks would simply be disposed of in the sea where they used 200 years to be crushed. Also, the ships themselves do not reflect the hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow's three members of the Russian Coast Guard Station were injured during the arrests in the previous week. According to the FSB, an even wounded North Korean later died of his injuries. On that September 17, Russian border guards first established a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened the fire.
United States imposes a ban on entry against ex-President Castro
The United States has opposed the former Cuban president Raúl Castro and his children's entry bans. The American Foreign Ministry founded in a communication on Thursday with Castros participation in "great human rights violations". As head of the Caribbean Communist Party, he presented a system in which thousands of Cubans would be arrested arbitrarily and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As Chairman of the Armed Forces, Fidel Castro's brother was also guilty of human rights violations by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime in order to support the previous Maduro regime are responsible for the persistent crises on Cuba and in Venezuela", Twittered American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had banned entry, among others, against members of the Venezolan government and the military. In Venezuela, a bitter force struggle between the government and the opposition has been tormented for months. The US has imposed a number of sanctions against Maduro's government in order to force him into the knee and help the opposition leader and the self-named interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government in oppression of government opponents.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go to the street for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate week, the movement of Fridays for Future plans again actions and explosions in dozens of countries worldwide. The beginning is expected to take New Zealand and Australia due to the time shift, before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large display in Canadian Montreal. Also before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather.
How great the worldwide commitment will be on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week, is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people have struck for the climate. This Friday we make it once again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, in the course of the strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - have been involved in the protests, according to estimates of Fridays for Future in 575 German cities in 575. This time, a list of the movement has been planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go to the street for the climate.
At the age of 15 at that time, Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 in order to encourage the politicians of their country to make a stronger use of climate protection.In a short time, the Friday-for-Future movement was created. In particular, students and students participated in climate protests, but also scientists and other adults are increasingly involved.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against heating and the threatening climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming has to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial time.
Thunberg had arrived just a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high sea racing yacht in New York, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she held an emotional speech at the UN, in which she occupied the heads of state and government of the earth. In her hometown Stockholm, she was addressed on Wednesday for more climate protection of the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will not be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman of the Department of Distress on Thursday in Moscow to the Agency Tass. The ban should enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who still smokes must therefore expect a penalty of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should relax a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the prohibition, the Ministry also has burning candles. Also to grill meat spiders on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Battle against cybercriminal - Detective lifting servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time lifted a large server provider for illegal transactions in Darknet.
A total of 13 offenders are suspicious of hosting numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel, using the internationally acting criminals.
This was notified by the General Prosecutor in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested in a large action on Thursday evening. The Darknet is a screened part of the Internet.
Among other things, customers of the suspects are supposed to have been the operators of the world's second largest Darknet marketplace for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which had crashed in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million Telekom router at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the cyberbunker, according to the general government attorney.
Such a host had been lifted out in Germany for the first time. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and in neighbouring abroad. It has been the result of nearly five years of investigation. In the afternoon, the investigators want to inform more details.
New global climate protests of Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go on the streets for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement re-established actions and explorations in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large show in Canada Montreal.
Climate-protest 北 Who are Thunberg's backmen?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. So surprising that a 16-year-old girl will keep the human power of that time the mirror before the nose. But what is behind? Is it helpful or wise marketing of a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for his own?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg moves the masses and brings young people to lift up for a better climate-friendly world. It is not historically the first time in Europe that a young person can win a collection of children and adolescents. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt out of the heart to become a fairer world. At that time, he has also been able to win a schar of young people for themselves, and it persuades to cross the sea to get into the praised country, similar to Greta Thunberg has recently made himself on the journey to America with a sailboat.
But there is a shadow side in this regard?Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? Furthermore, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. Besides, her mother has published a book that has sold itself extensively, thanks to the daughter standing in the Rampenlight. Also old-written followers of Greta Thunberg were a little equipped over the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too big. This is also not unfounded because the action came into the media worldwide very well and it flows much money thanks to the imposing action.
Here the spirits are now separated: Is it morally right to enrich financially in the world's arms? Is it still authentic when certain people circles work together with stock exchange agents during the world's restoration action? No matter what position is ultimately involved, a critical and reflected viewpoint is always more important in a democraticly shaped society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. That is why it can make sense also seemingly strange projects of certain trend setters to question critically.
Comet discovered: Interstellary guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The astronomers' suspicions have confirmed: A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment - he is only the second of his kind.
Garching/Washington - The researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by a amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is indeed an unknown comet, which does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind that was seen during the passion.
The great chance for astronomers is now to catch insights into a foreign solar system from the vicinity. Clearly, the comet resembles our own systems, as the astrophysical Institute of Canary Islands reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellary origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbel line that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before approach - and can be observed several months
But before it is so far, the astronomers can observe him in detail. In contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be studied from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the largest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Authority Nasa. "Then it will be only with larger, professional telescopes to see until October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First Insights on Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial bodies seem to be like our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the sliding star is similar to ours. This observation lays near that comets in other solar systems could form themselves through similar processes as in our, complemented the Leóns colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two of these objects have already been discovered within just two years, may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids repeatedly employed the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid ran by the earth and came dangerously close to her.
"Absolutely disgusting": Rachel Johnson distressed by brother
To Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister smacks the warrior language of the Prime Minister with clear words as "smackless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to relieve - at least verbally. At the time of the question in the sub-house on this Wednesday, this was a massive opposition emphasizing, and now more critics have reported themselves at word: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author said to the broadcaster Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, stretched, celebrated, deceived and featured". They think that they are quite disgusting. She do not recognize her brother's version again, Rachel Johnsons, who had taken the elections to the EU Parliament for the "Change UK" anti-Brexit party.
She particularly pointed out that her brother Jo Cox mentioned, a EU-friendly sub-house member who had been murdered a few days before the exit referendum in 2016 by a Neonazi. The idea of which one could best be honored by passing through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the sub-house. "It is very tasty to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," now criticized Johnson's sister. The offender was obviously coming from the legal-extreme warehouse, which was strengthened by this kind of language.
The widow of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used so," he twittered. The best way to honor them was, if you were passionately and determined for what one believes - no matter what view you are. But never should "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had come in the attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had set up his office as a state secretary and his mandate as a Tory Deputy. "In the past months, I had broken between loyalty to the family and the national interest - it is an insoluble tension," said Jo Johnson.
Johnson’s language also found a sharp criticism in the church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and Archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "this country is not worthy of it". In a common statement they said: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside the Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear at the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: In the mid-term show of the coming Super Bowl two women with Latino roots appear. They promise "a explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the next final of the US Football-Liga NFL, which announced the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira told in a video.
The final of the American football liga, which celebrates its 100th birthday in the next year, takes place on February 2 in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a parish-rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had been expelled from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as a actress and is seen in the German cinema "Hustlers" from November to November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She created her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first two-speaking album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
In the United States, the announcement of the mid-term passengers is expected with tension every time. This year, many are also selected as a political gesture. Finally, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and Rolling Stones have provided for Furore. Usually, in the NFL finances, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year, it came to political controversy. Reason was the dispute about the Quarterback Colin Kaeperick, who had refused to raise himself in the play of the National Hymne from protest against police force against Black, among other things, by US President Donald Trump. Solidarity with Caepernick, some musicians had rejected a Super-Bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the Rock Group Maroon 5 was finally criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber put Egypt's ruler to the point: Mohamed Ali is rather abroad.
The two men who have influenced the flow of blood on the streets of Egypt have spent the last week both abroad. One of the two swept back on Friday at Cairo Airport. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former General, who had praised the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected Head of State of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Sisis action against the political Islam in 2013 and did not lose silver over human rights violations at the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they dared to protest against the president. He had "no reason to worry," said Sisi at the microphones of the state reputation. "The Egyptians are not led to the mistakes."
In the wrong way, the President of the other man, who currently decides the event on the streets, is trying to lead to the wrong thing. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad where he withdraws from the access of the security forces that would immediately arrest him when he tried to enter Egyptian soil. In weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tonnnowning voice that controls the political discourse in the Cafés, the living rooms and the teestubs of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets", Ali calls his landmen to lift up against Sisi.
He goes directly to the Head of State and in quite rustic language. While the people hunger, the president swell in luxury and let him build magnificent new palaces, it says it. The army leader, on which Sisi is based his rule, provokes Ali corruption and enrichment. Because he has been working in his second profession as a contractor for 15 years with precisely these gentlemen, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about - that is, at least, the impression of many Egyptians, as demonstrates the right-to-exploring click numbers.
After the first week Sisis Griff had been arrested for thousands of people against his rule, and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested for this Friday, Ali called for a "million march". That really so many people would wage on the streets was unlikely. But there were smaller protests, for example in Giseh at Cairo and in the town of Kina at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants claimed corruption and demanded their exit. In these protests, the police also introduced tear gas and rubber shots. These videos were not independent.
From Mansura City in Nildelta, where demonstrators last week ran banner with the president's portrait, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built in the city and on the outfall roads. In Cairo several subway stations in the city were closed because of "keeping work", most streets around the Tahrirplatz, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on the Rabaa square, where the Muslim brother Mursi was killed in 2013, until the army took her under fire and killed up to 800 people, a different measure should prevent herself from gathering diss: Sisis future party was expected to hold a large announcement for the president.
Mohamed Ali caused these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrirplatz," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us get in touch with police officers." But as a retrainer, this is not to understand: "Great Egypt is the Tahrirplatz".
When the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be much slower than the provider, there are various testing options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not need to trust the provider's speed specifications blindly. Customers can check in case of accidents themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, explains the consumer central Bavaria.
If the connection seems to be much slower than the provider, there are different testing options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"The providers' tests are, however, based on specific requirements and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," states consumer central Bavaria on their side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set to the provider a reasonable period of 14 days in order to produce the promised performance. This is the best in writing by means of a subscription.
This does not affect anything even after multiple invitations, customers can cancel and may also require damages. However, in the end of success, only the way of action will help.
First ranked Republican for Investigation
As the first ranked Republicaner, the Governor of Vermont has expressed himself for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this is carried out from here, is determined by the facts that are identified," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the Whistleblower affairs before measures - an impairment procedure can lead to the suspension of the President.
Scott said that he wasn't surprised that Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian president Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions from the democratic presidential candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. For Trump observed bids "since years".
Republicans have been reluctant with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affairs; few have shown displeasure for this. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's Party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy several times, for example, against the halting of environmental legislation and the strengthening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in MCU: Next Marvel-Movie
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it was known that Sony and Marvel will go separately in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers"-Universum. Hardly unclear how it should continue with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives a further final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home".There are several US media that are reported to be consistent.Therefore, the cinema start is to be established: the film will run in the USA from 16 July 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spideys' way will continue in the MCU. I and all at the Marvel-Studios are very pleased that we can continue working on it ... He is the only super hero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But what is the sudden good news? Sony Marvel should have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Group Disney, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of Spider man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
So Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finals.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the United States has now reached the big final. In the last episode, many Happy Ends and as many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who contributed for many years in the series, were occupied in a charming manner. Attention, the following sections include spoilers to the final series.
One thing before: Duchess Meghan did not return to the final for a last decree as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess showed again. For example, the moments of the failed and the happy wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his dismissed detention.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned at the "Suits"-finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) went straight towards Altar to marry his promised Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a plenty of remarks about his suit. Whether he actually has been thrown a walk, the despised Harvey of the Bridetyam wants to know only to note snippedly: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
Aegeanis: Baby and four more children drowned at boat crash
A baby and four other children were drowned at the march of a refugee boat in the Aegean. Overall, in the accident seven people died, as the Greek coastline told on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey have passed over to the Greek islands in the eastern part of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNHCR) 174 people have died. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wanted to inform Turkey about the situation of refugees, said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens to help cope.
On Friday, a speaker of the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip Seehofers with the EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister of Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece there are still unusual many migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people left the Greek islands, said by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The rising figures have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who are illegally coming across Turkey to the Greek islands, and, in return, the EU wanted to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for any Syrian who is disfellowshipped.
However, the processing of asylum applications is difficult for the lack of personnel on Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, there are almost 29 400 people. The worst situation in Lesbos is: In a camp with capacity for 650 people, there are currently 5200 migrants.
It has never been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, reports the State Radio.

Especially people with heart-circle diseases, older people and diabetes.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photography
The Chief of Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, was manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multiway cup in hand on a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Kanada - It's been quite unnoticed - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw has never been held in hand on Elizabeth May, the head of Canadian greens. On the party's website, she was seen on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo was already published and also distributed to the media - and there was still a cup (Papp) cup, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green chef has to be responsible for photopanne
The National Post then prescribed May manipulation and that the Fake News Party produces in order to appear more credible in the subject of "Environment Protection", and that in the middle of a election campaign to the sub-home election, where Trudeau also has increasingly difficulty because of a scandal of bribery.
The photo was viral in the social media and took the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a contrast of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairman to hide their embarrassors".
May showed shocked and regretted on her blog, nothing to have known of this action. To underline this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in the hand. However, she put it right, was from Bambus. She always did it. A spokesman of the party said it was only about putting the logo of the party in the image, and not to hide something. From the photo is only a cut out on the website.
May writes, it's her regret for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said to the Guardian, and at the same time asked her team: "If she would like to do a picture again, they couldn't do something with my face, so that I look younger?"
The German Greens were also advised for their use of aweg plastic or for flight trips in Shitstorms - however, their pictures were not photographed. Thus the Chief of Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, eats on vacation ice with plastic spoons, as noticed.de*.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It was said that Jaqueline Ng had been assured by Cathay Pacific via mail, but when she asked for the check-in, she was not allowed to fly on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan gets an upgrade for the Business Class - of which many passengers dream. Sometimes they have luck, and the employees at check-in offer a change from the Economy Class free of charge.
This case, however, shows how to not do it: A self-declared influenzarin has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Instagram follow Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the flight, the employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, even though they showed an e-mail in which their Cathay Pacific was supposed to have an upgrade. The letter wants to have received the influenza from a marketing agent of the airline. On the other hand, the airline accuses Jaqueline that the mail was falsified.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried to get an upgrade to the long distance flight. This time the woman should have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they hacked at the center. And in fact, the employee from which the mail is supposed to come, the mail contact with Jaqueline was dismissed. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the Influencerin turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay the influenza fraud has committed, it remains blocked for future flights. The terms of the airline also claim that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to satisfy it - and now turn on a lawyer.
Oil prices according to report on the ceasefire in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon. Lastly, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea varieties Brent 61.83 US dollars - approximately 1.4 percent less than in the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
A report from the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia was supposed to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had caused five percent of the global oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels connected with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had declared the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia is responsible for Iran as the US government.
If an agreement is actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand care, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Raw material strategy department at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices continue its downward movement in the past days. A week ago a barrel WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Lastly, Bloomberg, under appeal on Insider, reported that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia, after the attack in mid-September, is moving faster than expected. Thus, the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and redirects to the original quantity.
Recently, there were several press releases called on Insider, reporting from rapid progress from the state oil group Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock exchange course and would like to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries was shown: The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest through Iran and the recently released release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepared the departure, while the ship was further before Anker, told Reedry Chief Erik Hånell in a text message to the Swedish radio on Friday morning.
However, the United States announced to move defensive missiles and soldiers to Iranian enemy to Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had temporarily pushed oil prices into the height over the past weeks.
Predictions against Trump intensify
In the affairs of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, excursions against the White House have become loud. Several leaders of government have tried to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a conflicting telephone between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This declared an anonymous notor. The spokesman of the Representative House, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi, explicitly presed to the White House. Trump spoke of an "hexen hunting".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim as questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that there will soon be a third summit of power officer Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and success prospects of such a meeting were questionable because of a lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said Spitzendiplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday according to the Agency KCNA.
The US had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, the consultant of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. He also criticized strengthened US sanctions and the United States and South Korea's common military maneuver. But he hopes for a "wise" and "mutige" Trumps decision to bring it back to an approach.
On Monday, Trump said that he wanted to know what a third summit should bring with Kim before he made it clear. The negotiations on a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been in Hanoi since the failure of the second summit of Trump and Kim in February. In June, both of them met in the demilitarian zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the discussions but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers are supposed to help mine cleaning
With a blue splitter protection west, the British Prince Harry in Angola symbolically exploded and destroyed a sponge. Near a camp of the British Halo Trusts at the place Dirico he made the ignition circle. In a safe distance, the exploring body exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola free of mines until 2025, he later asked for running TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names stand on these weapons but have not helped to make up for help."
Pounds under pressure - interest reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In view of a short-term interest reduction, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on a short downturn of the Bank of England (BoE) add to the pound of Sterling. The UK currency billed by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
Sales triggers were statements from the note banker Michael Saunders. This led to a reduction in interest, even if a chaotic Brexit could be turned off, since the uncertainty would affect the British economics at an absurd time. This statement is surprising, since Saunders was a defender of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelist at the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens for the economy through the Brexit Hickhack without direct signaling a reduction of interest. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country without a divorce agreement from the EU on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has received a high risk, but it could pay out for him, says trade sheet editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow Analysis Labor is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity of the Light Athletic World Association.
As a result of the light-athletic WM, new details about the Doping scandal in Russia come to a glimpse - and they destroy the few of the credibility, which the Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and which had only been used. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Labor finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: they were falsified.
In December 2014, a systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sports. The Wada had locked the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian sportsmen were not completely banned by the World Cup. The International Olympic Committee reads about 270 athletes of the country under neutral flag at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, 168 Russian sportsmen and athletes were at the start in February 2018. They were also allowed to join the world cups in the various sports games, even in the summer of Russia the Fusball WM took place as part of the host.
Missing Positive Founds
In September the Wada re-established the Rusada bann, but demanded access to the laboratory and the samples mentioned. The data should give information about the extent of the intuition of Doping cases in the state doping. They should help to punish athletes and athletes afterwards. Three months later they were delivered.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Light Athletic World Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping Data from the Moscow Analysis Labor has been manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check if the Task Force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurt General News" of Friday. "We have found a lot of discrepancies between the data that the Wada received by a whistleblower, and those who received it from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing in the McLaren Report.
The WM does not affect
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Light Athletic Association holds as the only organization at the Bann of Russia. At the WM in Doha 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo test.
At the beginning of this week, Wada had already put manipulations into the room and asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the re-locking of Rusada and in the worst case also exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
