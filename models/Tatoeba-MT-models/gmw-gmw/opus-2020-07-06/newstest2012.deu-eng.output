No liberating Novelle for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused to abolish the paragrafs in the context of a novel of the criminal law book on which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned.
The new regime, which could have evolved the way to liberation of the prisoner minister, rejected the Members in the second reading of the application for the reduction of the penalties on economic deficits.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October because of the conclusion of a allegedly disadvantaged contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet legal, and in December the appeal of the convicts is to be negotiated before the court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as a political revenge of the regime, and also in the west the process caused the suspicion of the pre-intention of the court.
The request, Paragraf 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to remove from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the libyan libyan libyan libyan rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As this region is used to win Islamists in the elections, the question is just what - the sanctified or the radicals.
The National Transitional Council announced itself to the customs law of the Scharī北a, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft you're hacking off your hand.
Women too should quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, possibly apostates of faith, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be united from each other by the Koran.
In short - in Libya a order will rule that is hardly imaginable here and, above all, it would be hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle isn't the only and objectively seen, probably not the best, and would varie hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
So it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters at all have been helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To apologize, only the fact that NATO’s air attacks were guided by God himself, not by any general from America, but by every success of its all-power.
The winners in Libya?
We only participated in a change of shots, served the interests of Islam and our politicians unpaid in the person of the dictator of a political allies, without having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we would prefer to avoid a military occupation of Libya.
This is why the Hiesiges are worried about, namely, the expulsion of the crucifixes.
But will the mineral oil companies also get the black gold at the spot price without occupation?
It is hardly and so that the West can at last excite itself with the right of its selflessness in terms of protection of human rights.
If they do not destroy the Scharī北a representatives.
Beginning of a new crisis-eara
France and the rest of Europe focus on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm deeped through Europe.
The individual States published their information on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the pre-quartal, Germany and France.
However, the bond market today racks all records.
The investors not only keep in mind Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries now.
The statistical offices of the Europe Zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, which was 0.4% from France.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected ( growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decline by 0.1% (original data only spoke of stetagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the pre-quartal, the gross domestic product and according to Tsch. Statistical office thus confirmed the trend in the slowdown of economic performance.
So the results are worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, compared with the previous quarter.
The German economy increased by 0.5% in the third quarter of the year, according to premature and seasonal data.
Throughout the euro area and across the EU, the economy between July and September recorded growth by 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to the analytics' expectations.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from its 10-year-old national bonds cleared the value of 28.45%.
The returnes of the Italian and Spanish national bonds rose to their critical limits.
Also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries start to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is deteriorated.
In Germany, votes will be loud, the ECB is to become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the worst task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-established Torwart Čech and a magnificent gate by Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a great portion of luck, the Czech football could defend its luxurious precursor of the home game and will not miss once again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the rising game in a detailed reporting.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happy 1:0 thanks to the final weaknesses of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus triggered their ticket for the footballEM.
Also, because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, the Montenegriners were only under pressure in the second half.
The birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be involved in the European Championships next year, and it is also delightful that the local football has a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes on, fairly fighting football was played.
Both teams combined long-term and thus played mainly around the middle line.
Also in the second half, the pressure of the home team remained, and the wide declines in the penalty were successfully refused by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for the core program of their country.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core program of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday noon before the object and then announced death to the US and Israel.
A few hundred students of the University of Iranian Isfahan formed a living sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where Uran is processed.
To do so, they wanted to announce that they were willing to protect the core program of their country, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has seemed to have not given up all its efforts to a nuclear weapon.
In Israel too, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed to the complex in the afternoon before the entrance and then announced death to the US and Israel.
In the event of an intention to put the Iranian nuclear programme widely lame, the Israeli press from the centre of Isfahan would also be the nuclear empiratory plant in Natan's target.
The menu of a fat-sufficient child: It does not breakfast and eats for the evening bread worst
More than one third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys proved - adipous children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important it is for the healthy development of a person to grow up the environment in which he is the examples surrounding him.
On the tables of adipous children, worst goods are up to half more frequent on the table than in families in which normal weighted children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had on the day before the education action under the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence" Pommes for the evening bread.
In families with thickeners, sports is not just one of the favourite jobs, but also the majority of today’s pupils - only 15 percent replied that their parents find at least once a week time for active movement.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, nearly 900 children from primary schools were surveyed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Cash and Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy cost and lack of family movement are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, suggested five times a day, in the mode of breakfast-two breakfast lunch-Feather-Feesper-Eventbrot - one of the main preconditions for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and worst for the evening bread
Experts point out that also relative minorities, such as the family's regular breakfast time, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families were breakfasts.
And - in most families, everyone breakfasts for himself.
The worst was the finding that in every tenth family isn't frozen at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the basis of healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children a lot of unhealthy pomes were consumed.
And almost every - without regard to weight - drinks sweet limonads every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed run sports, only less than half of their parents do so - just 15 percent.
Make up your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own food plan from opportunities offered according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in puncto diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many meals, meat dishes and, of course, sweet meals.
"Alarming is especially the great popularity of sweet limonades," the final report on this survey emphasizes.
During lunch, i.e. the main court, the pastures were conquered just before poultry.
The children almost didn't like chicken fruits, and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunches was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of the survey participants, which completed the questionnaire after the end of the informative lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence", a significant shift in preferences to the principles of healthy diet was shown in the results of the project.
For example, this was odd with the sweet limos, where many children began to give ordinary water priority.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed many frequent poultry or fish as the main court of the day and were ready to eat less necklace or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how to learn stylists, I had melted a bit that was a bit too much material for the beginning.
I didn't know anything else.
Lectures from three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "in the place" runs.
It's gonna be worse.
The closer to the test, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturdays and Sundays, it is still full of work.
This time we debated with director Alena (no single man takes part in the course) how to dress a woman who has no ideally proportional figure.
And that's the most of us.
The one has one too short neck, the other one too young with no decent curves and others are mollig.
It is a matter of the stylist to optically chash wide shoulders, extend the neck, or to emphasize the necessary curves.
We also received tips about attracting a female type like Jennifer Lopez - with large buses, broad hips and narrow waist - beautiful and figurative without doing too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the rock or pants really do not fit, at least one piece should be cut by measure.
You will surely not repent, because good seating clothing is simply unpaid.
In such a tailored rock, one feels much better than in one of the stange that always shakes up and shakes, in the waist, etc.
Youthful figures can in turn be allowed to wear clothing with folds, constructions, applications, embroidery or raffing.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet, I'm afraid that it's almost not possible to work in the face of the housework.
Each of the course participants was assigned a promi for which she should think of suitable outfits - day clothing and evening robe.
We should take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the corresponding star and its type of figure.
I'm supposed to attract Miranda Kerr, which you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than attracting Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which in recent times probably increased to the hundred kilos (near well, that is a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the clothing pieces out of magazines or search, print, and then process graphically on the Internet.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is mentioned, our very personal style and relationship with graphical design will then be expressed.
It is very important to reflect on the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (for example, trend-handbags, males, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about that.
But that's only Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday presentation filled with information on figure types was equally poured by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, by the fashion creator Jakub Polanka and by the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to use this out.
And embroidered stylist can work with a single clothing piece in a very different way.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat like usual over the jeans, that is, like a T-shirt or a coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, dress it and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to pick up the sleeves or the claws and the whole look look looks quite differently.
"Please play with it," he emphasized.
But most of it came to me the following advice: "You have to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally, I realize why we have to do all these teaching sets, what you can combine with something and why, even if you often get to see it completely different in fashion journals.
To be silent from fashion views.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you need to be prepared for a Fashion Story with ten pages (speaking ten outfits) to styl at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to expect all of this in the design of the outfit.
That picture and style sometimes represent half of the success, this also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
You just need to see Madonna a not really brilliant singer from which image and marketing made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Even well-known personalities often believe this for outcast money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look out is second-ranging).
And if one of us is already able to stylish, we should expect that he or she will probably impose a different (smaller) size on us than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to google to find sure that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has resumed or decreased, etc.
On Sunday, Jan and Mario urged us not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on the fashion and then "construct" the outfit.
In his work, he must communicate mainly with the people that he is stylish and he must be a woven psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering themselves and standing for his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to see her clothes cabinet and to complement beautiful pieces, then we can't clear her all the closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few commendable things that you recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us precisely what such a so-called "platz pocket" must include.
So such a bag that is knocked to the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprietaries.
In addition to such clear things, such as scissors, scooters for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (the stylist helps photographing products, such as handbags or chickens), special clips with which the clothing is reaped at the back if it is too large (stage needles or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric is not broken down) and of course sewing.
But not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to clothe shoes properly.
When photographing in the studio, where the floor is just, you can damage the shoe sole, sweat it outside.
We were sticking and sticking...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors, so you can't damage them.
So you've got to be very skillful.
Mario enjoyed me by commending my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was only the fraction of what we were hearing at the second weekend retirement course.
One thing has become clear to me - to devote to styling at a professional level, is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race crossing through America
Review
The original careless ride becomes completely avoidable, dilettant error for routine riding to the early layer.
Although the ambitions were largely fulfilled, what does this help if no one obviously liked to do a little more?
Even before he came to the shop table, the new part awakened high expectations with the subtitle "The Run".
He promised to move the game series "Need for Speed" again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples, he did not seem to be just one of many action race games.
We were also curious about the pastes in which the main protagonist rises from the car and continues on foot.
But as you've been used to NFS, the final effect is much different from what you expected.
Secure - potentially it is quite decent acade races, but as a whole, the game is weakened by some excess mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less years.
So there are actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of an incomprehensible faulty of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
First, one is introduced into history, whose main figure Jack has certain problems personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race-separated across America.
In San Francisco, thus on the west coast, one is going to be on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty races.
This means that each race is carried out on a different route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You have no moment the impression that game would offer the same again and again.
Some environments are still very beautiful, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing to do with the world.
But the ride through the desert, through autumn landscape or high above through deeply snowy landscape is visually very pleasant.
Sometimes untypical elements bring a little variation into each race.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that strongly restricts the view.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be obscured that you are not thrown by a plane.
In addition, the individual races are quite well built behind each other.
Only a few, but they're rich.
For a while, one tries to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have to pick up time (classical race against the stop clock), then you expect a personal duel with a single counterpart.
And that's what the police's gonna do, and that's what you want to do.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is rather about some interactive animations in which Jack flies before someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprised, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than you would expect (most likely only three).
Finally, this is more advantageous, because this element has at least no chance to become boring - it belongs in the context to the above said elements that make the game more varied.
The driver model goes in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That means, seen from today's point of view, although it does not rip out trees, on the other hand, it could not be claimed that it would be bad.
Those who are looking for realistic simulations have to look around elsewhere.
But an action-loaded race will continue to be well justified, even though you can find better in the competition.
So far, everything's in the best order.
Real problems occur only after some time.
Unlike driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
Of a game of this kind, it is hard to expect that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no collapse on any object knowing how the car is going on, then obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: In the case of tight overtaking or preparatory cars, in some places the other cars are "striving" easily, but in other, almost identical situations, you'll get into the sleeves and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the cars drive to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this doesn't matter, it's always angry.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the route, then you throw the game back to the last point of direction of the route.
Only - in every race you have only five restarts.
If you put it out, everything's going on from the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something does not succeed, but you should rather not leave on it.
Sometimes, however, does not even help the restart, there is nothing else that helps learn from the critical section.
Excellently unpleasant is that the same things are often happening in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit.
Otherwise, "civil" cars are always encountered in the same configuration, regardless of whether you are the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially angry in situations when you see that the contrahent passes in front of a playing two upcoming cars, but until you arrive there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is so designed that it comes to this situation always close to your nose.
The counterparts have further advantages.
There are a few places in the whole game where one is always overturned at the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
The most crazy thing is to finish the game on the long bridge that happens in opposite direction.
The contrahent has to get one out of here obviously on Devil.
And if he's already before, he's taking a view of one of them, so you'll start driving your own car a few times in Klump.
Clearly - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly rents the joy of the game.
And that's bad, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and, in fact, so much action-loaded that you almost don't know where one of the heads is.
And in principle it doesn't matter what "debt" is - the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of races in a way that no boredom can come up, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars in the course of races.
You must not overlook the gas stations on the route, because right here you can switch the car, although in most cases the car you have is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousins for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of play history also goes the task mode (requirements) - so the races in the individual localities you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is jointly for the tasks (requirements) and history.
To reach the higher level of drivers, different items must be locked up: starting from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously linked to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares its own results with the other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of further incomprehensible cutters is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come with the car into a subway tunnel (measured road), where you're racing on the rails in the dark (measured road).
On the Tacho, figures between 150 a 200 km/h (meineways), but there comes a subway from the back and rides a compromiseless to scrap.
In our editorial work, we will probably be fighting for a long time, whether this was a blackout of the game designer or if the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
The more annoying is that at some exciting moments, the frequency of the video is slower and sometimes quite dramatic.
This, however, concerns in particular the accidents with a larger number of stakeholders, where a continuous FPS is not useful anyway.
The sound reproduction is so far O.K. and the soundtrack is taste-suite.
In trying to address a young audience as wide as possible, a soundtrack a la "of everyone" developed – but who buys such a game already because of music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game would not be weakened by the total unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have claimed with the breasttone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game works unfinished.
A great pleasure for yourself, but you should be prepared to make sure that these errors with the power of airport vouchers are in the eye.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance among the individual institutions seemingly out of the lot."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to be burned."
"It will take five, six years until the wraths have been smoothed and all have been used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador at the European Union, began quite sharply her lecture at the Legal Faculty.
How serious it takes the motto "Scientific and openly about Europe", she already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which it managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such an overviewable and understandable way that it could have afforded so many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the Karlsuniversity.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At the beginning, criticism was loud that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who had not grown such a role, but I have to say that it has defeated all the breath as well as he has accepted the matter.
"He is a person who is able to listen patiently to seven and twenty Member States, to communicate with them and who has mostly clear ideas of how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, she then explained as an answer to the question: Who is that actually - the European Union? What number should I call?", so as an important step towards the agreement and the better readability of EU policy towards States, such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our oil maid quargel
Ms Vicenová also devoted to the agenda in which the European Union lived and intends to live in the near future.
She referred to the Czech presidency of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the presidency referred to it as a major negative situation which had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently having all the hands to do.
The ambassador said that it was not only at the presidency, but also at the subsequent crisis that has not yet been overwhelmed.
And there still has to be approved the EU's seven-year budget, which makes the matter much more complicated just because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and saving budget, which sectors will be priority, which countries will be more and less promoted - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Scientific about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, there are horrible shortcuts, foreign words and professional jargon that no one understands.
How should I, as a citizen, actually know if you really think of the quarry in Brussels or of round cucumbers and various large bananas, or if someone really wants to ban us the quarries?
It would also like to use the EU soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of the two or different speeds in view
According to the EU Ambassador, the Czechs are calling to be Euroscepticians who are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is more annoying.
Many factors are due to this, including the retention of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Do you believe me when a pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is close to me, then the French next to me says, "Hey, what are your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and there is a pretty sour mie.
According to Mrs Vicenové, in the future, the EU expects hard rules for the budget policy of the Member States.
As much more realistic as a "European Federation" it sees the concept of a Europe of the two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the euro area and the countries away from the euro area.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Strengthened Cooperation."
"First, it was said that only the countries that want to work together and those who don't want it should be quietly away."
"There will be more and more of such institutions, which will eventually lead to a strong Europe of the different speeds," expects Mrs Vicenová.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues with an impact on the EU must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the euro area countries.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters his existence in the second century
If you wanted to search for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM is most accurately characterized, then this would probably be the word "Langleness".
For the wide public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although since it was founded, it has already passed a century.
The basis for this longevity already laid her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He already represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a brand to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the firm internal magazine, which was already released at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the firm culture prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century because it remained faithful and did not preclude anything else to change.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society through our first century.
We hope that we will create more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company from the occasion of the anniversary.
Translucent system
In the thirties, Watson operated social care of his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Baůa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM staff had paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as working clothing and a thoughtful remuneration system for best newer and dealer.
The long-term relationships of IBM with their customers are equally cleared.
From the beginning, the company was generous in talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM raised any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will be altered by a woman at the top of IBM next year - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she took the position of the driver's, marketing and strategy chief.
IBM has been making so-called online Brainstorms in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - ideas are enough, in the company almost half a million people are busy.
An institution with good reputation
Their intimate position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this according to inside and outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps to solve business problems with technology," added George Colony by Consulting-Firma Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logo because of family "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in one century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM owns most patents and five of his employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
Its most famous inventions include, for example, banking machines, credit cards, financial swap, strip code or also the disk.
With about 220 billion dollars of stock exchange value (market capitalisation) IBM was the second largest technology company (even after Apple) this year, and it has been conquering Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The Eye Previous
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today’s customers - were unhappy, for example, the attempt with its own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally bound to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem building its basic walls on different platforms - and if they do not work to leave them again.
In contrast to the counterplayer Microsoft, which is in principle standing and falling with its operating system.
Successful technologies
In IBM's wins, services, software and hardware are largely involved in each one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware with more than fifty percent share was the strongest.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profits in value of $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in purchasing future powerful technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time fought like a storm over the world.
Here too IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment in the middle of the major world economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM is without prejudice to today's crisis.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008, and the company’s rein gain continues to grow.
IBM's business log is: everything can be changed - only the values are not.
Therefore, it should also be expected that this flexible gigant also masters the next crisis.
IBM History: From cheese cutter to global flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York a century ago had a quite complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM first took over in 1924 - it was originally a trademark name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies, whose history returned to the 1980s.
They owned technologies, such as the famous fastcards for registration of the start of work and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chaired by the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint, who appointed the Chief of the Competition Company Thomas J. Watson to help him in the management of the company.
This Leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shadow - on Watson's ideas is based on the unsiegable culture and identity of the company until now.
Watson was headed by the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name already indicates, started with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from worst and cheese cutters, up to casses.
In the first four decades in which Watson managed the company, he doubled their sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he had been in the head seat for 40 years, only then he was dismissed by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM of NASA were helping flights to all - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
In the meantime IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which set the computer standard of that time, came to the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold his computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, she bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCooper and was fully involved in the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy IBM has paid out in the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It emphasizes the intention to use technologies in a wise way in areas that have not yet been planned, for example, to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the trade sector IBM has recently launched the Smarter Commerce platform, which will help the dealers to lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia, which was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and here is also a top research team of world level that covers the technology of voting recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful gates:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her spouse Josef Rychtář (53) became their lover by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina was still hoping that Joseph was awakened from his pink dream and came home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the further life it has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no longer than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová of singer I. Bartošová had offered refuge in her own house, she wouldn't even have fallen in the dream of how it goes with her husband.
When Iveta moved back to Číčany after 30 days, Joseph went right away.
Yes, he even publicly knew that he loved them.
With the time Darina resigned, it even seemed that she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytář doesn't care with whom his wife sleeps
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"Everything, not as a loved, lost old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain bonds," Ms. Rychtářová explained; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated herself from him and is on mutual responsibility alone.
The fact that Darina locked him the back door, Joseph has so far worn with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper oath and I respect it."
"The company continues, I'll take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I'll make the purchases."
"With Darina I am very normal, we just don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, he wouldn't want to stop them.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who is that.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take over any responsibility.
The worst feminine industrious: What about you?
If the men are urged to call some typical female deceptions, then they will immediately shake some out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unsitted repues pass back that let men turn blood into the veins?
Sufficiency
Does your gentleman pretend them to be purchasing?
Do you need to buy at least one Hader weekly?
Would you like to buy in and may it be a little more on actions?
Then, in your case, it's really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of it and try to keep their shopping pleasure halfways under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman is already looking for a well-sitting upper clothing only to bubble through a dressing business and not to try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Why don't you think how often they've told her husband?
Permanent dissatisfaction
"I'm not too thick?"
"I need to take at least five kilos - should I start jogging or gymnastic?"
"I'm going to fall on you at all?"
Is that somehow known to them?
Yes?
Then you may also be among the women who are really occupied with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let go, but many men react allergically to it when her wife is constantly sad about her appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly inconsumable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against wind mills.
Tilt windows, tiles and dust, shake the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Do you shrink with their partner, because he once again tumbles with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, you shake the children, because the newly worn sink is already dry again and because the glass door on the living cabinet has already re-printed fingerprints, where the pouring makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviation", then you should know that you cannot overdrive anything and the order and cleanliness in the family life are not the first place.
This measured purity fimmel can ultimately also harm mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Stamps
"Smally pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to dress the old socks tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a nasty towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tyre, don't be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course, that's not badly meant, but they just want that everything has his order.
If the men knew this, the women may not have had to mecker so much.
Clatch and Tratch
Some women clutch and snatch, there is shaking behind the back or even slandering or snatching alliances.
Women are now focusing on relationships, so they like to heal such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, every one of us has a bit of harmless cloth and tratch in stock.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to confuse with clauses of crude calibres, who are nothing and no one sacred, who probably despises everyone in their surroundings and represents a significant danger especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with her assistence to victory
The ice hockey tower Jaromír Jágr had a large share of Philadelphia's 5th-3 victory on the ice in Carolina during the assembly game of the NHL with two assistences and is thus the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who was added to the Assistance and called the best player of the match, was used by the overview of the nine-en-thirty-year-old ice hockeystars.
Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček also recorded two assistences in the same game.
Jágr claimed after the game journalists that he had a great evening prophesying Giroux.
"Before the game, I tell him that today a hatching succeeds him."
I felt that kind of in my mind."
"Hin and again gets such a feeling," Jágr said, after whose action Giroux already achieved a gate at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the Puck behind the Tor of Hurricanes and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
One second before the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short dealer, but the second third was back to the Flyers.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr he scored his third match, then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's probably one of the best three," Jágr honored his center.
"I wouldn't have noticed that I was playing with such a ice hockey player as with him to finish my career."
"That's great to me."
"I cut my game to me."
"All the years in the NHL my co-players put their game on me and now the spies turn around," smashed Jágr.
Carolina made the game to the drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who took part in a criminal ward, came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in over two against one.
"Excellently, Pronger still acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took up ride and (read) moved to more remote phosten."
"I tried to meet him and am glad it worked," described Voráček's last match from his view.
This victory took Philadelphia to the top of the eastern conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and divorced in the second third because of an injury on the upper body.
The Candiens, besides their experience, also paid their leadership an unleashed in Penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the penalties could not transform Tomáš Placeanec.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably pained the high disease-related decay in the defensive - the game played only with five defensive players.
"That's bad."
"The encounter we played at the end only with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing to do, we have to finish it," said Jacques Martin.
"For every change, one attack wave after another, and we had nothing to oppose it."
"We had made the game easier and had to get the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech gatekeeper Ondřej Pavelec defeated thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeat, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
By 1989, there were only five government travel agencies approved in the ČSSR, Čedok, sports urist, CKM, Recrea and Carturist.
The travel offices sold mainly trips to the socialist East Block Countries, in the West, only chosen at that time.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia launched a prowest course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the eastern block (also the Czechoslovakia) were allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travels were not possible.
The travel offices already offered travel to the West, but they had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag before the travel office, or at least have "good acquaintance" in the travel office.
Even so, the thing hadn't been running for a long time.
The so-called devisenzusage - the condition for a trip to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a free exchangeable currency, so it would not have been possible to make the necessary financial resources (western currency) for a journey to the West without a currency allowance.
The majority of the Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates – a habit that lasts until today.
The total revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which one is no longer aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of the 1990s, the devising obligation was lifted up in the neighbouring western European countries, causing a huge wave of short visits especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovakia could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
The Czech vacationers slept on traveling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who had already had the money for a accommodation in the hotel or in a guesthouse.
A typical feature of foreign trips from Czechs was at that time a full-packed trunk room with conserves, beer and durable worst, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists could finally buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of life and thus the average salaries increased, which in 1997 came into another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demands for travel, after 1997, travel agencies started to prepare regular travels through charter flights, making flights incredibly approved thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already devised payments with all the highly developed countries in the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-off" travel, it came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight was made to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, every year, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying in far-reached sunny countries; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually in exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the epoch, which marked our postrevolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the USA raised the visa obligation for Czech tourists, which definitively formed our country among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008 the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head for a single holiday stay including the cost of the holiday resort.
The General Assembly is to find a new Chairman - a patt threatens again.
For almost five months, the Czech football has no chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the top of the Czech football association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary main meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is no agreement about which election order is to be elected.
And without this there is no vote on the three potential followers at all.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June Hašek resigned from his role, calling for his colleagues to find one another and a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era to Hašek, the old crossings between the two association chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This proved to be stonep and clear on 16 September when the new chairman should be selected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People's House in the Prague Quarter of Smíchov for nothing, because the negotiation did not result, and it was not just about the choice itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the secrecy representatives or also the officers equipped with a full power.
At least part of the agreement was reached in this single point, including the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, whose views do not constitute a voluntary representative.
However, the disputes about the electoral order continue.
The Executive Committee also no longer clarified its meetings, regardless of whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even though the opinions on the choice changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how should we proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a Patt situation?
"The point of dispute concerns the question of whether to deal with the statute or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in management.
According to a secular model, the third round of the candidate who receives greater percentage support in the chamber for which he can.
Mights are supposed to be willing to take into account the compromise that the candidate wins the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, is subject to the condition that the winner receives at least one two-third majority at this percentage of vote.
"Then the two predecessors have no sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-room concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the maize side, which would best find it not to turn the election order, but to choose according to the valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees, even though it is noted that the electoral order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"It is my desire that a long time after the statute is chosen."
"That doesn't mean any insane replacement variants, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time candidated and demarcated in his opinions above all Pelta.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
He believes that the new Chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the footballEM today would certainly contribute to the calmness of the minds."
"If the soccer only rides on the euphoric wave, it is also more willing to cooperate," says Jablonec's functional functional, who brings the greatest experiences from all three apepts, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl's more reluctant.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately silent."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moons, but there are some efforts to "adjust" the rules for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a re-blocking is not excluded at the General Assembly."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human mind ultimately wins," said Rajchl.
Just - a lot of time to agree on all sides won't be anymore.
Some negotiations are supposed to play directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football genericity will be complete until the qualification game.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, couldn't start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance, and so they looked feasily for a replacement variant, such as to bring some of the executive committee to the place of delivery of the Barrage-Hinspiel.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to be coming on Wednesday, is essential.
Joseph Dobeš, Minister of Schools, Youth and Body Education, would have liked the divided parties within the largest sports association of the country to agree.
It is a lot at stake: government contributions, the trustworthiness of the Czech football and also the upcoming ČSTV's main meeting, which aims to show the Czech sport the new direction according to the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is fighting the Chairman's position because he does not see appropriate candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the Chief of the Pilsner Footballer in front of the extraordinary General Assembly, could have been a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new Chairman of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have been involved in the fight for this top position.
"If there were a good lawyer, then I would fight for him and give up the choice."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorites of the choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the Chairman's function only one year, so until 2013, until the date of the ordinary General Assembly.
In the Chairman's position, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who was not too much involved in football events.
"I talked personally to some people in question."
"Take to believe that some told me they didn't want to identify themselves with the Czech football at the moment.
"Solche views would like to change," he quoted.
Most of all, Pullík allegedly disturbs the connection of Pelta's with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, which is regarded as a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegated votes on main meetings.
For Paclík it is therefore inacceptable that Pelta would have the chairman's position within.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and in the Czech football it wasn't going ahead at all."
"The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, was twice bad to the football," Paclík emphasized.
He also notes that Pelta's name was dropped in a corruption affair a while ago in connection with telephone hearings, but that Pelta was free of punishment.
"I don't know what prestige should bring a victory of Pelta to the (e.g.) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his previous pronouncement, "he will sell the Pilsn football club if Pelta becomes chairman," but already sees something more left.
However, if Paclík was victorious in the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the General Assembly in October, ended with a fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would go."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the National Team."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who had made it alert in September to replace the Dagmar Damková after the arbitration of the Arbitration Commission with Luěk Macela.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the association chairman grew.
And call on his capabilities in the management of private companies, since last summer he has also been Chief of Pilsen, who celebrated the first Triumph in the Liga with his support in May.
"I have power to change something in the soccer environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and vocation commissions, which results in distressing situations," said Pactlík, making no heal from his antipathy, for example, against the Sparta Chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the consolidation of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with which he would lobby with the political leaders that more money flows from lottery tax into sports.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote to."
"If it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to say stonep and clear where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not look at Paclík as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the president of the FAČR must be "overparty".
In turn, Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
"This is not ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense of transferring my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person to return after another half years," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will end up a Patt-Situation in the future.
Two days before the main meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates promised for the Chairman, namely Miroslav Pelta, he will make strong in the event of his choice for the FAČR to obtain a new statute which in the future excludes disputes about the election order from the outset.
The functionalist from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election struggle will be safely decisive in the event of any success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the unsuccessful election in September, in the event of his election, he wanted to concentrate on the national team and the profitation of financial resources.
He only decided at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting, so the two-month break could help him to defend his ideas about the direction of football and present in a wider context.
"On all levels they devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it's time for the association to be guided by someone, the man who is primarily connected to the Jablonecer club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also thinks that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the choice are responsible for the Euphorie, which reigned at times of Ivan Hašek.
"Members were approved at the General Assembly in June, which were not as perfect as they all had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we had already had a chairman since September," said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the main document of the Civil Association that he used as a locker for the delegates.
"If I am a chairman, then I personally accept him and am willing to bear personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a fundamental thing without which he can't be," Pelta claims.
In addition, he does not try to limit himself to his counterparts.
He had already announced that he could introduce a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he acknowledged for his legal education and knows well that his counter-kandidat would be his first alternate.
Tomáš Paclík also hasn't attacked for a long time, leaving no dry threads on Pelta.
In the soccer he has been moving over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
"But his attacks were decreasing, and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"For this reason, many doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his counterpart, who probably remains faithful to his proclaims, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes, to the national team.
And this should be the hanging sign of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all the affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the descendants of the corruption scandal last year."
"Only after that, I would fall to negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure sufficient financial resources for the whole football," said the six and fifty-four-year candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the tip of the Czech football would not mean any personal cleaning.
"I would have to get acquainted with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where, because of the long anarchy, sensuality is understandable.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates do not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If you really should be the only controversy point as you choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins back when it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly crucial day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR starts working hard under him
If the former Deputy Chairman Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected at the main meeting on Thursday as the new Chairman of the Czech Republic football association, this is supposed to be a rental of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice you start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the football and otherwise to continue the work that Ivan Hašek, the former president, began.
"As chairman, I want to devote myself to football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts to the UEFA and FIFA, about the national selection, professional football, to the performance football for the youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore wish to distribute the competences of the Executive Committee so that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks so that the soccer gets ahead in every segment with milestracks."
Many would not be disappointed because, instead of criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard now," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it has considered to be no longer candidates at all.
"From me I know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don't unequivocally throw me between the legs and question every step I'm doing," he said as an explanation why he had delayed.
"But many people told me that I couldn't give up because otherwise others would do it."
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
He is also supposed to encourage him to continue the work he has started under Hašek.
"In two years we have done a great piece of work, and I don't want to just throw it away."
"There have been started processes that probably only come into force in a few years and I would only disagree that they stop someone," he said and expressed his concerns that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would choose, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Hinter him stands mostly people who would make the football so that he would only be there for chosen."
I'm sure you can suggest some things, but not that I'm partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because it's all well and not just the chosen one," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a Chairman of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really want to do the best possible for mice."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a tragic part, whose winners then rose to the first league."
"Then it couldn't happen that today only three tragic clubs play in the league, which is especially a problem for young players in mice," says Rajchl.
Because the Chief of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has joined the Chairman's struggle, Rajchl does not trust to appreciate his chances that he is chosen.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to their vice-president and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl also quoted the saving of thirty million crowns for unprofitable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he partially blames himself that the association does not draw on a single strain.
While he says of Pelta, "he was disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football to make new confidence," he thinks the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football.
"Nobody can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he was chosen, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek initiated and also the personal occupation in the Commissions would obviously not change in principle."
He would certainly not want to turn things to his favor," judges Rajchl about his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Planning pools in Ufo-Optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike, rest the tired legs in spray baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on search during the past one and a half years, one in her luggage was not allowed to miss: her bathing suit.
Backlings lying on the water, she looked high in artfully designed dolls, she swimed marble poets waiting on the edge of the basin, and amazed over acrybically restored youth style swimming halls.
She liked a bathroom, she took it quickly into her notebook - with knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now presents them in her recently published book "Badefruden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her "rix to the most exceptional bathrooms in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to hate with sport, says Meder - it's just in the water that's different.
Annoyingly, swimming fans have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine steak, while Jogger can breathe in the alarming fragrance of fig forests or listen to a cheerful bird whisper in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubles architecture
Fleeters in the jumping pool and etheric sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are used, says Meder.
And when the builders have made trouble, swimming halls can be a true eye wall: "The place of a floor is a water surface in baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-formated band "Badefruden" conveys on 190 pages knowledgeable about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness oasen - but above all makes it a pleasure to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool collector Meder in their research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent healing baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an occupational carshave (Cave pool in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a flat-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, spectacular views offer many heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in the sight of the Zurich Dachbad, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the tying on the ski piste.
The most exceptional swimming pool design awaits bathing guests in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like an ufo landed just in the Alps.
From three open shells open up it shakes in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rising into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder rose the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell for sulphur, in Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba, it stinks so strongly for heat oil that one hardly believes to be landed in a health pool.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate healing water that is almost black and its sleeve sticks to the skin as soon as you get to the basin - a wellness experience of the special kind.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place looking for beautiful baths: when she wanted to visit the free and sunbad in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic was closed in 1902.
When Meder threw a look through the wounded windows of the red-white-gold youth style building, she saw uncrowded between the tiles.
On the other hand, in a magnificent swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three construction phases already have this bathroom behind itself; you can discover not only neoromanic elements that come from times of its construction in 1844 but also a maurian hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of the Iris Meder pool - not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to merge different styles of construction into such a great unit," says Meder.
At such a palace, the diving course in the thermal pool is apparently only by-suite.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank leaves raw material business to shine through
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January the head of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For German citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans, according to a study, it is not acceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions come out of this business because it strengthens the problems of the world's worst.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, author Harald Schumann shows that the competitions on the global raw material stocks are making prices high - and banks are therefore debted to the global hunger problem.
The consumer protectors' campaign is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are similar.
Originally, raw material laws were intended to secure traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the zockers have disconnected themselves from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the worst.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the accusations and said that no business was "valued to play the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the examination should be completed, then the results will be presented to the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bank - as well as recommendations for how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will then inform the consequences it draws.
At the end, a reduction in the raw material business could stand, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann boasts on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The bet on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatically how reluctant banks today harm the general well."
Ackermann now stands as the top bank lobbyist especially in duty.
"The Deutsche Bank must delete all the plants from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is about hungry people or about the call of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes surprisingly at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the Group wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief of Management will not change to the Supervisory Board as planned.
With a decline from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to shave - that would eventually have his successor to do.
Each second would cancel raw material equipment
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute of Forsa interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Especially eleven percent therefore believe it legitimately that the Deutsche Bank offers facilities that are betrayed at food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: according to the survey, each second would terminate all the investments in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would deprive acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent indicated to think about cancelling their account and switching to another institution.
21's House in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels 1958 awarded prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and came away.
Now he is reopened as an exhibition house.
When heated by modern post-war architecture, clear forms, glossy halls, courageous drums and new buildings typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussler World Exhibition 1958 is an appropriate and famous example.
At that time, Schwanzer Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
The construction is considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made known to the architects so that he built the Pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW-Viercylinderhaus plus sophisticated sidebuilding in Munich, he was finally famous internationally in 1973.
After the world exhibition in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South Railway Station, the pavilion planned as a temporary exhibition building had been rebuilt and opened in 1962 a 20th-century museum - the "20th House" was called it.
However, the building was not suitable for spatial and technical as a museum - no walls for the hanging of art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the pavilion, now called "21 house" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening the Museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a lucky case in every respect.
The new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Gallery of Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, professed art historian with considerably career, among other things in youth as a ice art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the Museum of Moderne Salzburg, made the reconstruction strongly with politicians and monument protectors, she provided public resources and private sponsor funds and established the use.
Apart from present art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the same name foundation, a café and a book store should exist, and an office house had to be built.
Strengthening oversight, small food
Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation for the execution.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna sensiblely and gained competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was a "unlimited important place" for him in which he had viewed the exhibitions "at least every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already lost generous and lightweight during his relocation to Vienna and his reuse.
There were far greater problems in the current reconstruction: the building was "a energy sludge," says Krischanitz.
The glass façade window profiles have been replaced, glass fibre-enhanced insulated insulation glass and replaced the glass roof with a special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two lower floors brought place for the new use, a lowered burial between house and road ensures the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still the light tail-pavilion.
The original outdoor doors are stayed, the house is cleared in the old red-brown roast protection color.
And the cinema is just as it was before.
And all of this under strict supervision of the Memorial Authority and with small ethnicity.
"A material that is good and cheap and also liked to the Memorial Protection Office has often had to be found," says Krischanitz and pointed on a twisted ground in the underground.
Despite all constraints, problems and transformations, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "reason a proper consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21 house is not in the wrong place, for it has occurred a city-building lucky case: Around the Swiss garden is just the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and housing houses.
And another lucky case may still occur: The 21th house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berliner Temporary Kunsthalle, and as one hears, it is already negotiating with the city for a neighborhood location in the Swiss garden.
Hole plant Winter-Krisen package in millions of height
The railway has a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train losses and delays, the Deutsche Bahn claims that this year more than 70 million euros are added to a newspaper report.
The "Image" period reported in advance under appeal to a group internal crisis plan that by 2015 investments of around 300 million euros were planned.
This aims to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather.
Among other things, a doubling of internal and external employees for snow removal on rail stations and railway climbs is planned to 16.000 people.
The aim is to free rails up to the start of operation and 90 percent of the operational sweeps within four to five hours from snow and ice.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, railway chef Rüdiger Grube had warned against train failures and delays in this winter.
Last winter, the railway in passenger transport had considerable problems, as it was lacking, among other things, in difficult weather conditions, of reserves.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Railway Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in delivering ICE trains.
The railway also has been creating for years that it has to make axes of ICE trains considerably more frequent in the workshop after a ICE in the Cologne main station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the USA
After the tumult for Chief Josef Ackermann, new discomfort comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home weren't enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry's races are still bringing its past into the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million in a comparison (106 million euro) to settle disputes because of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA suggests a whole range of large banks that cooperative banks have led to the purchase of financial products with false promises; they would have reduced the risks.
Such papers lost strongly during the financial crisis, and the banks went into depth.
"We are pleased that we could solve the subject without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not grant any debt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying $20,5 million.
The NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two currencies.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. commerce banks and jumps in pleading to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA attempts to replace the damage caused by milliards.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also fought other large banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage-backed Securities in question are the mortgage documents.
These are home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble was placed in 2007, this became a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the climax of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers turned out.
Even though the events have been back for a few years, banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the USA.
Investors and supervisory authorities have endeavoured numerous complaints in order to obtain re-establishment or to recognise wrongs.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest claim wave.
It proposes 18 international large banks to have over-privileged two US real estate financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage shops in volume of around $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to raise a complaint from the FHFA, which concerns several transactions of a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority demands that the Frankfurter stand up for "substantial losses" without, however, a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims and explained that they wanted to refuse.
Warren Buffett increases 10 billion at IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests strongly in IT company IBM.
Since March he has purchased shares in the value of more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the large American investor Warren Buffett had always explained that it was not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of companies is only poorly predicting.
However, he has now read IBM's business reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He has already had to understand much earlier that IBM offers services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment of Warren Buffett is considered to be a rider in the financial world.
As a result, the IT Urgestein IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now revealed in the US economy station CNBC that he has bought IBM shares in value of 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a proportion of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM did not even know anything about the commitment until now.
He commended the management that even in the economic crisis had provided ordinary profits.
"You have done a great job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM has been focusing on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centres for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company calculators.
Buffett had previously avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett attacked, for example, at a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or machine-makers.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and developed it with wise investments to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Still, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cultural figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost deceitful sense of money deserved him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
According to the Buffett investment, the IBM shares increased by a percent pre-country.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion at the stock market and is thus one of the most valuable technology companies in the world together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he didn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is at stake.
After the discovery of the Zwickau Cell, Turkish media doubt the German rule.
A newspaper even speaks of a "blood ideology", which is now rebuilding.
The murders of eight Turkish-staming people and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a legal extremist background.
This message is responded with anxiety and anxiety in Turkey and within the German population in Germany.
For for many German Turks, this is a long-reliable sponsor: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more similar violence with legal extremist background against Turkishs.
Nevertheless, the fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany was never in question.
However, the open-covered legal extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is still unavoidable.
"Rebuilding bloody ideology?" titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasizes that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the legally radical swamp.
Besonnen responded to the Turkish municipality of Germany: she remembered the victims of racist violence in the weekend with a Mahnwache before the Brandenburg gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a festival act of the fiftyth anniversary of the German-Turkish Convention.
In cheerful colors, the co-operation was embodied - as a story of success.
Like an earpiece, the reporting of some Turkish media works: "Germany gift to the fifty" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" can also not be used to draw this thoughtful connection.
"It starts stinking," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and had made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In German Turkish Internet forums, the police's actions are discussed very critically and their success is later.
Why the German authorities weren't much more likely to look for suspects in legal extremist circles, the authors are surprised.
Some of them are at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: "When there continues to be slipped, the migrants remain nothing but self-defense and armed."
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"From the goodness of the clarification and accuracy of the punishment of the entire network, inner peace in Germany depends very much," writes "Selen".
What it means when the inner peace is in danger in Germany, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have been clarified.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the doors living here more clearly that there is a tackling threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can mood in right violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the we feel on Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, mainly the failure of German politics was attacked: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack by Solingen, he sent a compassionate record to the Turkish president, but at the funeral celebration in Cologne, he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then counted in his speech how many charges the Turkishs provided.
As if the value of a person is calculated according to the height of his taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows the deepness of the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and re-evaluation of legal excess terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The Scandal Bank of Zurisee
The most adventurous bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankruptly in the financial crisis and has since slipped into the next of a crisis.
Now it's supposed to judge a German.
That's why Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, he was announced in July that he would take an almost as spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, praised Switzerland whether its beauty and the UBS are their newly gained solidarity and made friendly remarks on the future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround."
"I look forward to cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would come quite differently.
A trader of the UBS in London had transformed all bank security systems and had scattered around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS Chief Officer Oswald Grübel, a not only in Switzerland famous banker, had to go.
The President of the Administrative Council of the UBS has also been considered to be a victim - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally come?
It was already known that Weber is allowed to consult the Bank from February 2012.
And the Administrative Presidency is taking over in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank reported on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's getting hard.
He is not a banker, but a economic professor and a note banker, and he certainly needed a working time.
With a stroke, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has proved once again that it has long deserved the title "greatest Scandalbank of Europe".
For the UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and has been slipped on the other for years from a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid, but also buffed Swiss assets managers had combined them with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in the investment banking.
In 2007, the UBS managed more money of capable customers than any other bank in the world, on the one hand with 1.6 trillion dollars.
On the other hand, as an investment bank in the league, she was prevailed by the largest banks in the world.
That was impression.
The one-way banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: "My students always put the UBS as a pattern of a good bank at that time."
"Today, you wonder, "How could I be so misled?"
He was seriously wrong.
For the first time in 2007, it was apparent that something related was in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief of Director Peter Wuffli returned surprisingly, who was previously considered a highly intellectual and also genial banker.
A few months later, one knew why he had gone.
The bank's investment spare had broken down with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
In order to school this, the UBS announced an increase in capital in terms of sage and write 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, however, which some of them had still been rubbing the nose until recently: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund that had been so silent that one did not even get his name.
But that was only the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, President-in-Office of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, still the second paid council of Switzerland in 2006.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS stood in the financial crisis in view of its failures and had to be saved by the State.
The National Bank purchased the UBS for thirty billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced change bond that she could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it housed so large banks.
Finally, the UBS 2007 balance sheet was more than five times as high as Switzerland's economic performance (see graphic).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says bank researchers Geiger.
The second one joined the first catastrophe.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of assets customers who may have deducted taxes using the bank.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions and penalties.
The UBS thus known more or less open to help in tax distortion.
At the same time, she lost something that has ever been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of Chief Executive Board and Administrative Board President.
And the Exodus of Customer Moneys.
Thus, within a few months, the Bank lost its credibility in both central business sectors: in investment banking by failing speculations and in assets management by means of aid for tax retraining.
And just when it got a little quieter again, just as one thought, now the UBS will get it back again, then this unsolicited dealer story follows: A single dealer scatters EUR 1.7 billion before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it is evident that risk management in investment banking still does not work.
"With the case Adoboli, you have to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Bank Institute of Zurich University.
The financial board of a large German bank is certain: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not handle risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had taken a long time ago to become guardians of the world's great assets: no too big risks, security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic could break the world up.
The Tresores of the Swiss banks became a symbol of intimate reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The centre of the UBS in Zurich is still fitting the clic of the shared Swiss private bank - it is just a bit larger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Zurich Railway Station, which leads from the main station from the Zurich Sea, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss Mountains.
The buildings here are splendid, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditions such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks have stayed here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elitary private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS Reception Hall is entered by a heavy rotary door.
Inside the walls are marble clothed, there are thick leather chairs, beside the bank logo a large sign of the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point drowned - or betrayed how the boss finds a small Swiss private bank.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he is doing business with the two large banks.
The UBS has become too big, he finds - especially in the investment banking, where the fishing axles have also spread.
The Swiss wouldn't have anything to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the habits of the angel axis."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking, which changed the UBS, gave its only high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Great Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was visible.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hesitate in his book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros, politicians approved to save the large bank standing before bankruptcy.
How could it be?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three Swiss large banks joined a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for the small Switzerland, and grew ever further.
This helped the two different precursor banks of the UBS complement: a rich, but sleeping bank with the focus of assets management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came favorably to a lot of money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are connected to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the Group of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdomen, who worked up from the banking teaching to the top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Surely, exaggeration came before the case.
The UBS' staff are clearly reminded of the leadership meetings on which Group Chief Wuffli repeatedly issued the same parole: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank in the earth.
They quoted the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
The UBS wanted to go up there.
Some steps were already lucky for her.
In the foreign exchange business and in the share trading, she played on top.
However, business consultants who were commissioned stressed a weakness: in the international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS have gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gambling, UBS entered an adventure that she almost cost the existence.
Hungrig after growth, both the Bank itself and a hedge fund established before it invested in U.S. subprime plants.
It developed into a huge machine which packed securities on American mortgage credits and continued - but was also self-risk.
Even when other banks long sought the exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS has bought there," says Bankenexperte Geiger.
So big the eufora, so deep the case.
One manager after the other had to go than the attempts to clean up were more difficult than they thought.
Posts at the UBS became the sliding seat and are up to date waxy.
Whoever leads the big bank now has a nearly impossible job.
It has to find a strategy for a bank that has erected all nearby business models.
Bank researchers Geiger already has an idea: closure of investment banking, focus on assets management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go (now).
But investment banking is supposed to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
The next Thursday, the new bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swisser was only thought to be a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from predecessor Grubel.
In the meantime, he has been persistent: he is to permanently conduct the businesses of the UBS, the Zurich Bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the middle of the nineties.
He's reaching 3500 places.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn money?
That's the questions Axel Weber's question now.
Publicly, he only says that he's only going to look for a apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.

Intelligent crowns spread out in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered as "problems": But the cities have long been displaced by the highly intelligent animals, experts claim.
The one likes them, the other wants to get rid of them very quickly: crowns have been part of the city image for centuries, but in many municipalities, residents complain about dirt and noise of the animals.
A means against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows were no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crown symposium in the East Friesian empty.
There, experts from the entire federal region advised about possible pathways.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature protectors also led the problems in cities to the fleeing of the particularly protected seed crowns: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the cases of typical brought trees made birds difficult to live.
Crowns are under nature protection.
Large colonies with more than 600 broth pairs are available in the western Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen and in empty.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the massive killing of crowns in the county for negative activities.
Criticians had described the catching of the animals in bird traps and the striking of knuppels as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the amazement, doesn't bring anything," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver found out of empty.
Nesters spray away with water or fall trees, often have undesirable consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Emperor from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals differ, large colonies split up and distribute themselves in other places."
Greeting is only possible as an exception to hospitals, old-age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them away."
Without the surrounding country, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, mayor Wolfgang Kellner said empty.
It is thought to be a combination of congratulations of animals from sensitive housing areas and locking offers to relocate them in other places.
"Infotables instead of chain saws" the psychologist and ethnologian Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different dealing with the animals: "We can finally bear the best of ourselves."
Jürgens had founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Asheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, on the signs of the signs of the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise of the birds, Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication that has a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crowns not only use tools to get to a delicious bite but even produce their tool itself as a tool.
Conduct researchers at Cambridge University have recently tested on four seed crows, as far as the intelligence of birds is sufficient.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they had to bring a tool to the collapse to get to a motten larve.
Without a lot of training, they determined the size and shape of a stone must have to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the prudent crowns had to solve a more fragile problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small ice cream with a mottenlarve.
With the snail, the birds could not reach their probe.
However, the researchers had put them wire pieces.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with which they then put the oak on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks on a coup remained.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland are involved in EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have dissolved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Following the two-successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal hit Bosnia-Hercegowina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation in succession perfect after the 0:0.
The Czechs ran a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off back game at the outside of Montenegro, after the replay (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
There was nothing more to burn Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland took a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) achieved the further results for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed tradefmeter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had reduced for Bosnia twice.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red map (54.).
Bosnia had already failed Portugal in the Play-offs to the World Cup 2010 in South Africa.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal took a start by measure.
Ronaldo hunted a 30-metre free stroll for the early tour into the masquets.
A good quarter hour later Nani showed his wide-shot quality and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance by Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The Ex-Wolfsburger from the English table guide Manchester City put a headball on the bottom of the Latte, but the ball did not exceed the gateline (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, arbitrary judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergoldding was centered.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Criminal Area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after a action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely changed.
After the break, however, the Vice-Europe champion of 2004 made it clear with four matches.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81th minute.
In 1976, the European championship champion is going to EM for the fifth time.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Federalliga-Legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1 FC Nuremberg) had also been lucky and had to survive a horror in the initial phase.
Endman Petr Cech, with a reflex at the last moment, prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the penitentiary border just close to the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crosslet had to save for the already beaten World Class Tower of the Czechs, again the storm of the FC Seoul (50.).
The gate shortly before the end finally made it clear.
Turkey therefore missed Zagreb's football wonder.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the doors in Zagreb did not exceed 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hiddink has to clear its place as well as safely on the 2002 WM third bank, Croatia can enjoy its fourth participation in an EM round.
The Turks had almost caught a dream start before 1,000 spectators in the Maksimir town.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance shot only the phost, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the puncher in the gate.
However, after the horror, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians didn't burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who took place for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62th minute, the federalliga legendary Danijel Pranjic (Bayern München) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni is going to EM
In Dublin, Iren celebrated the first EM participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of trainers Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a predetermined decision with the 4:0 success in Hinspiel, in the 32th minute.
Constantin Vassiljev (57.) was similar to the guests.
Ireland had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment, the Estonian rear team prevented the possible leadership.
But in the 32nd minute it was ready.
After a defenseless defense of Finalman Pavel Londak, Ward was the place and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

Mass slaughter at a personal level
Simply and generously, Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and horror. A story of the First World War, tells you in nineteen fate halls" with a long list of major people who are at heart.
Here's a tip how to handle: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in Englund's romantic story very well. And these main people will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you lost men and women like Englund in the fog of war and robbed your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he does not describe as "a work of anti-Geschichte".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, rushing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is "feels, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unintentional men and women together on both sides of the war, from school girls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, hospitals and office employees.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become war prisoners, lose limbs, become mad or die.
Each of these lives flicks up like the votiv churches in one church, some come up while others disappear.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war on the Westfront.
"Beauty and horror" walks with expert views of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall bees baskets, a celebrated Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsetsflies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, such as a hurricane Katrina who shouts for Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or take the escape?
Who's coming at all?
Someone understands what's happening or why this war is being run at all.
"Fealing facts," says Englund, "were excited with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and germs."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship matross.
Their stories were mainly extracted from memories, letters and other materials already published.
Their life reports can be horrifying or thrilling, but they are very alive in Englunds of the collection of small moments losing in detail.
Many of them are defecting and helping.
In the history of a German school girl, he says: "Replacement, everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, wrong cycling gum, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells more about substitute eating in Germany.
He describes "Fleish made of pressed rice and baked in hammer fat (and was last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes filled with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of worsts, 511 registered coffee replacement agents."
Some stories are of honor and braveness.
A American recognizes his own drang to wilderness and says about the war: "Man feels that despite all that was intended for men rather than sitting in the lean chair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to do so than meant such a façade civilization and as if there were no barbari behind their own strengthened and beaten shirt breast."
In turn, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and that he will not take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you take distance from the idea of offering yourself, you want to think this happens before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was imprisoned in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart and about new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic contest," says Englund, "a war between the factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestial of the young century," "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in measure, which slew, while sitting behind a desk."
People are acting in an unforeseen way and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a sex disease to escape the front service.
"The great expression of it can be discovered in the trade with gonococic eggs, because soldiers bought and smashed on their genitals, in the hope of coming to the hospital," he writes.
"Jene who were really desperate struck him into the eyes, which led them to be blind the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, Englund's poetry is melted, yet inconsistent and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he begins the way the war "in a unique way uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to wonder why their leaders bring them to battle.
The best books about the First World War were usually more falsified as Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "Nots new in the West" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional fame hall.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it anymore.
But it is as if he had taken us away with his book this page with the main persons in front of the nose and had burned us with a string wood.
After an early failure, a minutely planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved in carrying some of them utilities.
It had been decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday because at this time there are little people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. All the others initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the diernate and gave the household writers an enormous increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by watching occupations in other cities.
A disaster exercise took place with a view to Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called chaos education - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid shifting of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to enter the park came "in the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the commands, which spoke for a declaration as "exercising".
"The few police who were involved in my knowledge did not know that it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then turned back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had experienced these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including commissions from all over the city - dogships of mobile officials who are normally used in high-criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people go in and out in the park, almost like Pendler, so 1 o'clock in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people stayed in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before departure at the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the previously recorded news that drowned from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their bright blue wind jackets, many protesters just picked up their things together and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 a.m., no tents would be taken to give the protesters time to pack their possessions together.
Other teams of officials were seen how they gathered in the area to intervene, arrests should be needed in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson of the police president, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they were to stop watching the police operations in the park, and they said that the dealings of the officials were very rude.
Mr Browne said that TV cars in Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the great confusion of personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, art grasses and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, which had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared shortly later on the Internet.
A main core of protesters took place near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park.
Some barriers built, and the police continued their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp joined their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Officials of disaster protection were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until 3:30 a.m.
According to the police, the relocation was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests came, as he said, because of "inappropriate conduct and resistance to a arrest".
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, chief of criminal officials, was also there.
In spite of his presence, Mr. Kelly "not the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they had to access, a second group of officials was waiting on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, Barrikades were built.
It could be observed how these locations from the police continued to expand the surroundings around the Zuccotti Park.
At one place, several officials, many of them with protective signs, were observed to drive people out.
There were about 28 people in the north.
Some of the most violent activities of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 a.m., a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tyre of a police bus.
In one place, the quantity threw a piece of locker wood.
At the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of the maintainer will lodge action against the city for dismissals
The union, which has lost hundreds of school attendants last month, plans to complain the city on Wednesday, because the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on schools that teach poor students.
The action is probably the last possibility that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to undo the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy school workers, care coordinators and other employees, who belonged to the city's most poorly paid staff and lost their work on 7 October in a chess train, described the union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund that the working groups had held with which the budgetary gaps should be closed last year.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a consultation of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the discharges were part of the budget that they had adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that the budget does not specify anything that employees would be released from school aid.
Officials of the City Council 37 said that they had and warned the Ministry of Education for a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the application of the action before the Supreme Court in Manhattan is formally announced.
The complaint will lead Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as an accused and count eight dismissed workers as applicants who are all colored or Latin American women, such as most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman of the city’s Ministry of Justice, said that the city does not prejudge the complaint and so their individual claims could not be commented.
According to a draft action that was held by the New York Times, the union concentrated on the number of dismissals at the schools in the poor districts of the city to support a complaint for inequal treatment. She claims that poor schools had lost more helpers because they were chronicly underfinanced.
It states that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and only few dismissals in the schools of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers in the district of 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
In finding the loss of five of eight schoolers who were employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of poor parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. Furthermore, money lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra financing for each arms school registration.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were led by the language in a memo, which approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: translating) in the USA usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central station.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were released, not transposed," the draft action states.
Mission finished, Congress ready to communicate with Libya
Finally, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already talking about the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee for International Relations of the Senate decides a resolution under the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "mood".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was simply in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House argued on the choice of a number of resolutions for the approval or disapproval of the role of the U.S. military in the Libya Mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the restricted use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad border group of two parties and there was no vote.
The same day, however, this law came through in the Senate. In addition, the Chamber agreed to a decision to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
This led the U.S. mission to a kind of legislative vague fire - with a convention that had been raised enough to criticize Obama's approach within the mission, but not angry enough to finally remove the ground under the feet.
Then the event took over the unresolvedness of the Congress.
Tripoli fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO Mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their self-release" and "commends the men and women of the U.S. military partner and their coalition partner who support military operations to protect people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Committee on Foreign Relations or will they divide the legislators as did the law of June?
The last version is the resistance of the Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republician of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is at the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every conference legislature of the Republicans and some democrats.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or of another area that comes at the time of voting in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte change is only one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress, including a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to the Congress as well as to the Senate - others are only slightly different.
In the Senate alone, there are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change and another dozens that would control "bound expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - in particular beginners with the Republicans who want to polish their course - the possibility of praising that they have "fascinated" such a measure.
The budgetary control law adopted in August requires that Senat and Congress vote on a change in budgetary balance.
In March 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some Members want to limit the number of provisions which members of the Congress may submit, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) intends to limit the two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage under gender is just as a change that prohibits burning flags is a recurring presentation.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if the two-thirds of the States reject them.
As diligent as Members propose amendments, they move as quickly as they have been in recent years.
At the 111th Congress, legislator 77 presented such changes at the 110th Congress 66.
The pace remains compared to that of the early 1990s, where members regularly suggested more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures available by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment, which is added - the 27. - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Frequently, but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after a armed man shot on her from next distance during a election event in Tucson, the Republicaner Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on Monday evening in national television. She singed alone to the Broadway track "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than that of returning to the convention.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she rose in words and needed help in walking.
The mission showed the heavy slow recovery of the damage that the ball divided its skulls through the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned to the convention astonishingly to give her voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "swore".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford answered (41): "Good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the Astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly "20/20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The special pursues Gifford's recovery since the attack on 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, you can see her in the hospital bed, with barely shaved head and a long scarf over the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
months later Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nick with his head.
It's a pocket with the lip.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords flips another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see how the Congress Members sing together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12 he had read an article of a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time after the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The suspicious protector Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is necessarily treated medically while waiting for his negotiation.
"Many people died," said Gifford's Sawyer.
"Hart, heart, heart."
During the restoration of his wife, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?" said Kelly.
You've just been hit.
And you will stand through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Truppen feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street Gala, who gathered millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
One hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The quantity in black smokes stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation action in spring.
A ranked military officer on the Gala, who was observed by the chief and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphanage children," wrote the officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it wasn't a respect, really not.
The contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its prize, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if you do people in Uniform Suffering.
"We were not victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded forces in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently, the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who want to appear unthankful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They have also realized that the anger, the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War, was far worse.
Consequently, talks about compassion in breast-feeding and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, the Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a feeling of reverence, as they were defeating rebels and traveling to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "great, violent veteran is hidden under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had taken over an elevated state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtlely asked whether he could be able to stand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the battle.
"If you speak of your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," said Cancian to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield are rarely considered to be praised by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroes as it was absolutely common in the Second World War," said Leutnant General David Barno a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is mainly concentrated on the suffering of a service member.
Truppen find recognition for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces the growing pressure to tighten through rape
This week an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of non-intervening in a rape before the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who had a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if he would accompany her on a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texanerin was making their concerns on the side.
I thought, "Aw what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard of my abdomen feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man came behind her, pushed her down and raped her, claimed her.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officers wait fearfully for a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it decides whether a complaint which they have raised against the former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is allowed to court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not taken action against widespread rape within the military and under violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., submitted, the complaint included at the beginning of 17 applicants, but in the following months it began to 28: 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to determine, condemn or provide adequate justice after the supposed attacks.
Burke says she's pursuing the top military leadership, as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted almost 400 more survivors, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of putting all claims their eggs into a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many further complaints to maintain the pressure.
The team of defense for the Ministry of Defense, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to reject a complaint.
The acts of the Court of First Instance which Newsweek is present have a detailed version of the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be accused of current or earlier soldiers for injuries to which the forces have come.
Due to a Law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries that are added to soldiers in the active service.
"The alleged damage caused during the military service of the applicants," the document states.
The Ministry of Defense refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in battle negotiations.
It's time for the military to be modernised, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her battle: three more complaints besides them are advancing.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four main military academys for suspicious promotion of a woman-fighting atmosphere.
Of this independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veteran of America gathers a complaint against the military in which the diagnosis "personal disturbance" was concentrated on the victims of rape in order to release them from the service - a common practice, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veteran Administration (d.h. the administration of the war veterans) in which they prescribed their discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who indicated that they were sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which provides a number of points of evidence.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (Dt.: Office for Prevention and Reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defense 3.158 sexual abuses were displayed.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes account of about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases in which it comes per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: in 2010 20 percent of the prisoners were in court, only half as many as civil law.
The applicants in Burkes case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the suspicious rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked for the sex she had before the attack with her friend.
Six people said to be characteristic in the name of the suspicious perpetrator, who was finally declared free.
"I remember the day when the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the woes were going to take place. I ran out of the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personal disorder and declared it incapable for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed unfairly, so that she would not receive any support.
Whether the complaint that Lyman and the other complainants have submitted is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should go ahead."
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine, which is criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctor.
The military decades afterwards, because they do not have the same incentive and the same arrogance that brings liability.
He adds: "The chances are against them, but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the lawyer of the applicant, will begin with its hundreds of other claims for future cases.
"We will continue fighting the military in this respect until it comes to reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became a new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who stood to have committed his first public hearing in the court at an amocratic race in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time until he attacked his computer and has appreciated some of the millions of nationalists who support legal extreme groups on pages of social networks.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how to find her?
This is easy - you just need to log in to Facebook.
"We have found it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recently published report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that the researchers simply need to use the site's advertising tool to define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as it has been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-hand extreme groups throughout Europe and then looked at them with adds, but instead of linking themselves with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds users invited them to a survey in which they asked for their education status, their attitude towards violence and their own future assessment.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 members of 14 very right parties in 11 European countries, without having to leave their office once.
"It's a pretty new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprising. Online-Förderer of legal extreme groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activity are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and politicians use the page to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who averagely add three content per day, Facebook's "Datasupernova" generates a research tree that has made the number of scientific work with the name of this page rise by almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this site you can study people who are usually not reaching with their Clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first, and they would never have given them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook all of this falls away - you're going directly to them."
Others say that the page offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who talked about their reluctance on Facebook tend to drink problems significantly more than students who are swaying on this subject.
Moreno suggests that equal numbers of students, for example residents, monitor the page and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you didn't recognize it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and Head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way of identifying threatened children that wouldn't have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly picks up the data of its own population.
The data team of the site has created statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's day, election participation in the intermediate elections 2010 and a National Gambling Index (which has been primarily used information on which only Facebook has access - Masters of Digital Freedom have long been aware that the page should make its large data base available to others for research purposes.)
However, the users of Facebook know that the page observes whether they want or not. To play Scrabble with a friend that is away thousands of miles, you will be able to get your own personal data to the site.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey that they do not even know anything?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines as they collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users at all have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a Clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no replacement for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to take care of the social sector - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Call and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood two amok runs in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple rider in Norway," he said in front of a court hall with more than 500 people.
"I appeal to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations, support hassidologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I am not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monopoly, since he "didn't give it the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who gave a predestinated speech, the permission to contact the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik investigating for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will monitor all the visits and the entire correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted the confirmation that he was behind castle and beetle.
All participated with the aim that everything would go beyond the way.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to NRK, the Norwegian broadcaster.
"It was unpleasant, but for me a piece goes on after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked quietly and professionally during the entire hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not sick of spirits and said that there was no evidence that he had had complicated.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 were apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the distress and confusion that still feels a whole nation?
"I wish he looks like a monster, but he doesn't do that," said the family of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford and highlighted the technology genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans might find the most intelligible in the recently discovered job interview, which was released this week before special film presentations on the important markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and himself appointed hippie, but he was also an arabic organizer who was zealously based on diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffered from "a disease of thinking", "that is a really great idea of 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of crafts art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringly developed the TV series "Triumph der Fachidioten" about the breakup of the staff computer. And he sat together with jobs for more than an hour in which they had one of the rare, detailed discussions.
At that time, as 10 years had passed since Jobs had been driven from Apple, and he already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in experts, he says that the copying templates of the interview were missing in delivery.
Only after Job's death, a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview" which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to abhor detailed interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly zealously in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds meditation, where jobs clearly consider his thoughts and are striving for accuracy.
There are also moments in which Jobs' Perfectionism comes to pass when he seems to be unpatient to Cringes' questions and pushes him to get faster to topics or adhesions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the lost interview appears to be incredibly widespread when jobs evaluate what other companies make his opinion right or wrong and his own vision of the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthume demands of the career jobs'. But to see jobs here as the curious dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Soon after doing all of this, he pulled off and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of lost interview:
How he learned to conduct a company:
"Why do you do things?" I always ask, "Why do you do things?" and the answer you always get is, "Oh, so it's made easy."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing. No one in business really thinks about things.
I found that.
Jobs continues his efforts to rationalise the accounting at Apple.
Amazing how costs were recorded - mostly one started with "standard costs", which were counted on mere suspicion and then adapted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined up to the smallest.
How the Pope was specialized:
Jobs tells about the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could enter the telephone company and take remote talks for nothing.
The device has already been written a lot, but Job's enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is infective.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable phone, perform a call and then connect from an AT&T network to another, while running through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when you grilled in the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next to it," says Jobs chewingly.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that can control billions of dollars of infrastructure all over the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without them.
Jobs continues to tell about a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were so well able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called to speak to the American diplomats in the middle of the night, they had to ride before the Pope came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12 when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequent teller, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phoneat, jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at age and it formed my views about what a company was and how well it dealt with his employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever produced".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with browner tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to find spontaneously new products.
Early in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a customer to build the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think of both the composition and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later at Apple he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember pissing arguments... they cried me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse we could have built for $15. That was incredibly credible.
Over large companies that leave down:
Long before he made Apple resurrected, Jobs saw the pathways on which so many industrial aggressors met their visions into stumbling and lost control of their shares.
"Say we, you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copyer or printer, na and?"
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, i.e. [is it such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of the decision.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly is required by the people who do not have a concept of good products vs. bad products, eradicated - craft art.
That happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been 10 times bigger, Microsoft could have been the 1990s...
They caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"It's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You're learning a lot about his feathers.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it goes beyond the taste, it goes beyond that one tries to intervene with the best stuff that man has created and then try to bring these things together to what one does.
Picasso said that good artists copy, clue great artists.
We're always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who are randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of the health laws when court takes case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically shared question, whether one will listen to a fight against the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in a dinner sponsored by the court that the case will be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt was a complaint that had raised 26 states against the extensive reform of healthcare, which had been decided last year by the Congress, a law which became a slogan among the conservative activists throughout the USA.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, in March a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected, which is probably going to be arranged for the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full at the time when the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who stands in court and will claim that the law is to shine will probably be Paul Clement, once general attorney under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen companies who supported the annual dinner of the Federalist society, an old-in-essent group dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsors the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who fights the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical agant Pfizer Inc., who is enormously involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel for a few hours after the court had consulted the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Head of the Republican Group in the Senate and an clarified opponent of the health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been visiting events of the Federalist society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempted from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the Lower Federal Judges.
If they were, they would probably be covered by principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge can participate in beneficiary events of law nearer and other organizations, where the judge may not be a spokesman, a guest of honor or a host of such events according to the program."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas was sufficient to two of the firms involved in the case as well as to a firm with a massive financial interest in this to alarm moral and government activists.
"This astonishing break with morality and the contrast to the code punishs the complaints of some judges, the court holds the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the USA.
"The judges won and dinner during a beneficiary event with lawyers with floating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support of a donation action for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would be mixed too easily with groups that can be guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist society.
And Thomas's wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general prosecutor under the Obama government when the first laws were brought to court in first instance.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case for prejudice, since it was too engaged in the defence of the law to be unprecedented.
Kagan doesn't make any instances to do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 trillion dollars to land
Airline Emirates order 50 two-way aircraft of type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than 1 billion dollars.
It is really a rare message that a company gets a job over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business when the company of the aircraft manufacturer is Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft is at a record sum of 18 billion dollars.
The contractor of Boeing is also unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need 2.520 aircraft worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced his biggest order for commercial aircraft at the weekend, measured at the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammer contract came from the United States Airline from Dubai.
The airline also announced, as Boeing announced on the Dubai Aviation View in 2011, an option on the purchase of 20 other aircraft that makes the entire list price rise to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8 ordered the so-called Dreamliner, which enormously improves the gas consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these planes is more than 1 billion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar Stockman.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are owned by the oil-producing countries.
So they don't only have the money to pay the planes. Instead, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not as harmful as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or move aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural security," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-space aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitors SAS in chess that attacks the pre-power position with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that one would move the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was suspended to gain greater confidence after customers demanded a higher load of use and range.
The Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses apparent choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer Fausto Vallejo supported the PRI in the race around the Governor's posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her application for the office of the Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race around the Governor's posts in the Western State from the institutional party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime during the entire election process and especially on the last day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys ... you have occupied election cabins, built street blocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just beat Claderon, who had led to the surveys before the day of election.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolution Party PRD, the currently appointed Governor, was at the place three, a severe defeat for the split and happy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan was dominated for a long time by drug cards specializing in marijuana, heroin, and amphetamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence still takes place.
A PAN mayor was killed one week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates have gone out of fear from the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how absurd the elections appear in Michoacan.
The man who is probably represented by the PRI in the race around the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory lets us look boldly to the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help the euro area rescue
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the Eurozone in its severe school monument crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two world's fastest growing economic nations have to do "all things in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who are "stricky" in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all sitting in the same boat."
"So everyone can help Europe from this crisis," he said Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asien may be protected up to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all means."
In recent months, the European Monetary Union has been in a severe school monument crisis.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers have withdrawn from Italy as well as from Greece.
The rising serious school monument crisis in Europe is anxious that the global economy could crash into the recession and led to calls that the leading emerging countries would have to do together in order to support the euro area.
Mr Nag foretold that every support of Asia is channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements, such as the purchase of bonds of the EU Council, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), offer greater negotiation power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India everything is going to do in his power" to help the euro area, as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and drying foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the euro area to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face great challenges and we have to get a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a job, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have an indication of helping the rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the U.S. Brown University, said that it would be very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million of dollars or less a day.
"Where they will find out that the Greeks are going to retire with 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used in order to maintain the numerous and well-paid public service employees in Greece, with jobs in badly managed, losses such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the crisiss in the euro area will have "significant Domino effects" across Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/ is now threatening "the risk of degradation" due to the threatening danger from Europe.
He said that vulnerable threshold markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital immigration of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon for possible defense cuts
Defense Minister Leon Panetta heated the convention on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security without notice, so he dissolved a financial chain response from the halls of the Pentagon to the warfare sites in Afghanistan and the civil fluid bands.
The Pentagon already thinks shortages of $450 billion over the coming decade, but now fears that further reductions will be needed by $600 billion or more if the convention cannot complete the expenditure.
"The effects of these reductions would be devastating to the Ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress in the creation of a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called coverage, would lead to 23% general reductions and a stop of numerous new projects.
"Soll a high reduction, carried out in such an undeliberate way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unperformable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernisation efforts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be forced to unwillingly separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with certain probability to reach the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who keep our military upright and seriously harm our alert will."
The reductions were finally hit by the fighting forces," said Panetta.
"Where the war-time contingents in the anti-terror warfare are not directly affected by the attack, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the efforts of war," said Panetta.
"Personal settings have been reduced, which would lead to delays in the settings and the attitudes that support the war."
"The salaries of staff would be reduced, which leads to late payments to wartime dealers and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details about the potential influence of automatic reductions on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of a sequel of the Ministry of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as a leading military force in the world."
"We are opposed to this draconic act," said the senators in a joint declaration on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly no one that we should be pushed up."
"The concealment is a threat to the United States' national security interests and should not be allowed to enter."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands for a reduction in the pentagon.
Panetta has increasingly expressed the possible reductions, although he has been able to collect many years of experience with the budget at the convention and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing serious decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a dark picture that could be ahead - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without a sailor."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air-waver without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, a army of the barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," said Panetta in his opening talk in the Pentagon.
"It is a force of war that lacks moral and alert preparedness and which is not able to take it up with potential opponents."
"She makes a really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta presented new details of how reductions create "significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our worldwide ability to use and intervention, which leads to an inacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects could be victimized, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list includes F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber plane, the next generation of ballistic submarine, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighter that Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If one stops the further development and tests of the F35, this would save up to 80 billion dollars over the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to boost, so that possible dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Unlearn a Lüge
A look at the current headlines shows how vulnerable and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The President-in-Office of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is busy becoming a master of the accusations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides reject each other from the lie.
Penn State's management is accused of the myid, as it is said to have kept reports that a retired football trainer boy abused sexually.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French president Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to the American President Barack Obama that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
The New York Congress Deputy and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself a narrative when he turned into distresses that were very quickly rejected by inconsistent evidence.
The former candidate for presidency John Edwards is accused of violations in the campaign financing, which is related to the deception of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it, has triggered the media circus, President Bill Clinton, when he lied to Monica Lewinsky during his second term of office at the Oval Office on his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about shoes in school and college tests are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the answers to examining so that they were very well in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and shoes are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times each day.
However, many of these lies are considered an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing or "covering lies" is a thing that is important to learn for every person, both for personal and for professional reasons.
Far from a societal game such as Sharaden, where it is the goal of calling "Hab you!", the decoupling of a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the past six decades at renowned universities that carried out extensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of research is that most old myths have been deprived of lying.
lying looks in your eyes.
They don't always stotter, stamp, rest, and tackle.
However, it is not possible to conclude that these liars are hard to cover and uncover.
An trained liar can penetrate to truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine face expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years in examining the scientific results of the comprehensive and continuously growing area of decommissioning, and it is clear that decommissioning a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us right in our complex world, especially if the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belongs to our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good in esteeming other people whose interest is awakened and controlling their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research we know that extroverted people are more often lying than introverted people that men are more often "self-oriented" lying than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often lying to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that if a person has been deceived as a wrongdoer, others feel less guilty of lying this person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by watching the normal behaviour of this person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, laughter, the voice quality of their experimental person.
They should know better when someone normally triples with the foot so that they do not accuse him wrong when he triples with his foot during a meeting.
Then take care of accumulations of obscure and non-verbal behavior.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells, not as evidence of dismissal.
People who deceive, may be disturbed when they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet point to the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the conversation", this deep, relaxing breath and the change in the attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questionners often fail to signal that a constellation conversation is over, only to look for this relaxation after the consent.
In addition, look for the language of your experimental person.
Scott Peterson's exiler is famous when he used the past shape when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and a national search for her triggered.
Thousands can also use a distant language: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeated a fragile question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a fragile question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... according to best knowledge and conscience."
As a result, the answer is more perceived than material, which often shrinks the alarm bells.
There is no magic agent for depreciating lies, but you can learn skills thanks to which a depreciation is possible.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can become more rarely a victim of fraudulents, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after risk by delayed US authorisation
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, with which the trade unions were annoyed and at the same time restored environmental protectors, the pipeline-building companies are trying to plan the project to return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the parliamentary building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said that the company continues to be confident that the pipeline is finally approved, even with a different course.
To this end, after an announcement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which one would be postponed a decision concerning a federal authorisation for the project until the new possible course was reviewed, which avoided the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered, may postpone a decision by 2013 after the elections in the coming year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and admitted his support.
The 1700 miles pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrel oil per day from Alberta Province to the raffineries in Texas.
The pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmental protectors hate them, but they love labour markets because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislator Nebraskas, who are against the plan, consider the laws to force a departure from the region of the sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy states that the main auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate pronunciation of the review procedure focusing on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist, who was stopped by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was consultant of Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is connected with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused, as she supposedly forced a small child out of fear to break
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have received an attack that would have caused her little daughter to be so scared that she had passed away from fear.
The tyre of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month old Genevieve Monk such anxiety that she suffered from "personal changes, sleep disturbance" and "great fear of strangers," said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was last 10 November, when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, was a nursery gardener, and Genevieve wanted to break up for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on the arm to the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle exhorted the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone: "You should not put your daughter off near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to shrink - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to kick water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you've done with my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle crashed on the mother who was still carrying Genevieve on the arm and had to be held back from her companion and moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to pass, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an excuse in writing, but no answer was received.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The complaint is on a non-protected compensation, but the attorney of the family, Sam Davis, said that he does not charge any Honorar and plan the family, the money they get to donate to child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely inacceptable, especially when it is displayed to a childgarten who wears a 18-month old baby on the arm."
Climate climate inevitablenesses burst the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is at the government, Sinaloa increased unemployment and blackwork, while foreign investments declined and the economy staggered.
In 2011, Sinaloas will remain in memory of the economic history. It is the first year Mario López Valdez, who himself referred to as the initiator of change and emphasizes great hopes regarding economic growth, is in the government. However, due to the climate, it cannot be spoken of growth, but the most important economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions in agriculture, but also strictly restricted the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year This is mainly due to the historical degradation of agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which affected further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (dt. Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural crops were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity by November continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican State. The Instituteo Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, since from January to March 55 053 people were not employed by Sinaloas, which corresponds to 4.53% of the population in employment. In the second quarter the unemployment rate increased to 5.28% and from July to September to 6.19%, which resulted in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa.
Low liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that public institutions' policies indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we observe is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses on the market due to the cuts in the medium by the legislation adopted to combat money laundering at the congress, because for those who forbiddenly charge dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined, on the one hand, due to the problems of entry and on the other, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work that makes unemployment rise," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if we take into account the high proportion of black work, which includes 60.38 percent of workers working in the country without paying into the social insurance case.
Unemployment and blackwork are the lowest wages, the lowest throughout Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituteo Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Regulationsbehörde for Employment and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 Pesos until September, which is much less than the general government average, which is 7375 Pesos.
Decline of the ADI
In addition to reducing economic activity and growing unemployment, in 2011 the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) over the last ten years is recorded. According to Secretaría de Economía (governmental Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to 630 597 dollars from January to June, which corresponds to a threshold of 87.74 percent compared to $5 143 312 during the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Regulations Authority for Economic Development), on the other hand, represents a total investment of 17 280 000 Pesos in 2011, which comes from businesses from the tertiary sector.
Debts
In the light of the economic crisis, the national government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 peas to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities at the National Congress in July. The National Congress approved a amount of 200 600 000 peas, but by November no positive impact of debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be identified.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first government year Mario López Valdé's government inability made it clear.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico), represented that in 2011 no effort was made to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa was really very short this year. It has to be worked hard to recover this year's lost terrain and in 2012 we have to work twice. The efforts of all, in particular the progress of the government team already well agreed, have not been sufficiently harmonised," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year were degrading and slowing down the economic development of the country.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the Frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficiently in motion to create an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Company Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, said that the state must be given more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that it was worked. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine economic vocation and line of the country because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that guides government efforts into better pathways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas that can be said that the government has done more extensively. What I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work before it," he said.
Arrest due to 8 kg of marijuana
To five years in prison and 100 sets of days, a resident of Navolato was sentenced for the possession of eight kilos of Marihuana.
The public prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of Marihuana.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I Act, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican army on June 7th 2010 in monitoring the Ciprano Valdez road against the watchpost No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug retailer was driven in a white car in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the rider's seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason the confiscated product was handed over to the judge of the district and the punished person is still in the executive body.
Debt for construction
Miguel Ángel López Miranda said that the social buildings for migrants provided in the programmes Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 are in danger of being completed because of lack of resources or only with great delay.
The head of the urban authority for social development stated that although the construction programmes have already advanced, they are now in danger, since the government has not paid the resources it has incurred that exceeded 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, so a delay of the construction was expected.
"12 millions of them have to contribute, and although the year already ends, they did not give us a penny, and that, although they had already had to pay us part in July," he said. "To be not too late, we have already started with the construction work, and they have already gone far, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the State had not fulfilled its obligations, so at the beginning of its government time the municipality had to receive a loan of 7 million, representing the amount the central government had had to pay.
"This had already been done during the last legislative period, because the State did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to obtain the resources that the State had not made to participate in these programmes," he said.
Even though the governments were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance was requested to accelerate the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as quickly as possible.
"At least 12 million have to accommodate them, and although the year already ends, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015.
The conversion of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints submitted by the Senate and the Deputy House against the Presidial Resentment, which must be prescribed for the exchange of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required for the application of law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed its responsibilities when he issued the Decree of Law with the details of switching to terrestrial digital television.
This decision denied the constitutional dispute which the Senate brought into existence, since it did not receive the qualified majority of eight votes required, so that the Court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the project for the action drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed that the Decree of Law for Constitutionally declare, since the regulations relating to radio and television are responsible for the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Telecommunication Commission in Mexico), and therefore the Decree of Law would contradict the hierarchical principles and the preservatives of law.
For the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies gave constitutional complaints against the Decree of Law. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree of Law and initiated all activities to establish the digital transfer.
The Council of Ministers also refused the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Members without entering the debate on the project for which Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In its contribution, the Prime Minister expressed that it did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government cannot regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general rules.
"I don't think that if you do so, the independence of the regulatory authority would be affected." It also reminded that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, for the purpose of the planning of the government's affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals through digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place throughout the world in recent years, and it makes better use of the radio-electric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The disfellowshipping of the transformation, it said, is a suspension of the use of digitization, which is a decision in public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, they stressed, "required the action of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of characteristics that put the Constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already done the digital conversion, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
It was not possible to conclude that the government would take into account the competences of the Congress with the issue of the contested decree, because the laws adopted by the Legislative would comply," she assured.
The possibility of selecting the voting list in Michoacán individually shall be considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the Governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
The possibility of a single statement of voting lists is a reality in the elections in Michoacán this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the Governor elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes from a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that the Electoral Office had just adopted a number of regulations on the harmonisation of local rules with the reforms of the Federal States in election matters last November.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution or his electoral law or his law on election justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they did not enter into force in this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the state indicator within the time limits provided for by the argument, nor objection.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint submitted by the local legislative and judged the State Representative's voice to the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", as it does not have the right to "decide or to a veto against it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview on the possibility of individual statements of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM, the local electoral could now be able to tell the voting list partly or completely.
For example, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more votes may be partly counted.The results in the protocols do not agree; the Protocol on Voting Reciprocals and Calculation is actually unprecedented or it is not owned by the Chairman of the Election Committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the Protocols.
In addition, the overall statement of the full-filled electoral certificates may be made if there is a difference between the suspected winner and the second place which is equal or less than a percentage, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit application by the party-or coalition chairman, who is the second of that candidate.
The statement of vote may also take place in its entirety if, following the conclusion of the ordinary calculation, it is found that the difference between the suspected winner and the candidate is equal or less than a percentage in the second place, provided that there is an explicit application by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the choice packages which have been exposed to a partial expiry would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of a total of 923 vote protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
Its ashes will be distributed over the Zapalinamé mountains, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés revolved this Sunday evening at Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday the dead show and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the last will of the Supreme Lieutenant was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains.
After an honor, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila, together with the others in the event of the accident.The next people attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o'clock in the afternoon, the ash of the Supreme Lieutenant landed at the grief hall at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family and friends came to.
At 17.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Technological Institute of Saltillo. This body show was initiated by his former schoolmates from the technical abitur and his American football team, Felipe Bacio during his preparation on the abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains. He had always said that to his family and his friends," announced Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the Supreme Lieutenant had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had been in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as father and as son, a loving brother and he was always standing for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to join the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't take it because they thought it would even be dizzy on a truck. Yet, he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even at the age of seven of Zapopán, he had been graduated from his family. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what best liked him: a plane flying.
A Last Department
The captain of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all honor under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honor was given to him the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the Head of Technological Educational Institute of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985, as well as in sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were demolished.
At 18.05 p.m., the occupied remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, met to be delivered to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by the Major Jaime Martinez, on the front of the barracks, and his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other members, students and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a property at the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military members presented the media eleven people arrested in the same village in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found by shots in different parts of the body and a grace shot in a left Finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the mileage point 1.5 of the Landstraße from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several pastors saw that the door of the landhouse that was surrounded by a beige-brown wall was rising.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people in the inside about three meters, which they immediately communicated to the competent authorities.
One weared a yellow T-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; beside him another who was clothed with a white top.
Near one metre away the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the stomach.
According to the information received on site, the three persons must have been murdered in another place as no cartridge huls were found.
At the wall of the country house you can read inscriptions that write an organized criminal band to another, as well as several consignments were found in wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) presented 11 persons, including a minor who were part of a criminal process mainly in the town of Cadereyta, and who were associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (people hunting) and secretaries.
According to the information made public, eight people were arrested in Los Alveros on 11 November and a prisoner was released.
Three real estates and a cell phone were secured. The arrested were confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12th, at 06.00 p.m., soldiers found a car with two inmates on their wake round in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
At the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charging device and 18 cartridges.
Later, on 13 November at 14 a.m., one of her complicities was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape when the military was seen.
They will be charged with secret support in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday Education of the new Italian Government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present this the new government, which is to offer the forefront of the crisis that has led Italy at the outskirts of economic breakdown.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present this the new government, which is to offer the forefront of the crisis that has led Italy at the outskirts of economic breakdown.
An announcement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President-in-Office, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm government education.
It is assumed that he will introduce a majority of the cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will join his office.
Monti said that he would present to the President of the State the results of the discussions with the political parties on government education.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to deal with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government education, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well sealed," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, that is much less time than normal. In the meantime, Italy fights against a political and financial crisis which has pushed the cost of debt into an inferior amount.
The new government, led by the former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard savings package called by the euro politicians to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure to hurry on Monti was increased by the swaying market situation, which caused the Italian State bonds to be charged with 7 percent interest for 10 years, which corresponds to the state where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industrial Association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti, "We said we would support this government after all."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
The success opportunities of Montis were significantly increased by the support of the PDL Party by Silvio Berlusconi, which had to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the middle-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because many of its members have so far expressed themselves against a majority of technocrate government that is just forming Monti.
Parliament support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support for the implementation of probably unpopular savings measures.
Resistance against its efforts or the renewal of reforms could again cause a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks is exercising pressure with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurship associations as well as with youth and women organisations.
Tuesday evening the round of the session should be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, as a response to the crisis, launched an extremely rapid change in government.
After recently breathing up at the end of the last week, when it was known that Berlusconi would withdraw, because of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of Italian national bonds has again reached critical limits.
Italy's rescue with a government debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU resolution screen.
Monti said that his government must take up to the next elections expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of prefering elections.
Monti said that he would like to take politicians into his cabinet, but the large parties would be aware that this should only consist of technicians, a reference to their concerns in the light of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and unanimity between the parties make the involvement of people from political life complicated.
Spaniards have more games than the Ticos
From the 22 players from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the bucket.
From Costa Ricas pages, only one of the 22 retired 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendship game that takes place today at 15.05 at the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and Europe champion, the number one on the month's ranking of the FIFA, can look back to a considerable number of class A selection games, the three-color team only has the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup masterships) as well as high-level Europecups like the Champions League.
In addition, experiences with the Spanish Furie in complex excretion games at the Eurocup and football world championships.
On the other hand, the Tico footballers have few international encounters in the context of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA ranking list.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached an equality with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (the Netherlands 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-coloured team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of Barcelona football club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from the UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian team that had reached the magical number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle tower of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of Hunderts also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Follow him Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, the left side tower Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Those with the least games.
Less than 30 games appear in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the sides of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even approach the 20s limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had no debut yet.
The historical gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot with nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett called Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate his twenty-year-old existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that realizes itself"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of its best concerts in the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assured that they realize a dream when they play in Costa Rica.
This assured the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from Brazil last week an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20., they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will be in the National Stadium with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read an excerpt from the conversation, whose complete copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your costarian fans, a dream comes when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realised for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and until now it has been great.
I've only been for vacation in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we'll probably stay there for a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted, and they're experiencing the days before the concert.
What do you say of your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We used almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting for as long and we're sorry to have used as long as we came here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the largest show of the year.
Isn't that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the most great shows we have put down in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in São Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're happy to play there.
We love this country, we enjoy surfing and are enthusiastic with the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends are always traveling to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are to surf. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour, you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't set any limits either.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly so because we have nine records and can play more than 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we will play is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we haven't played in the repertoire for longer, we can keep our concentration upright and surprised us because they call us the reasons why these songs liked us. Otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and I believe, therefore, also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
If you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I think that no one of us imagined playing in a great rock band once, and that's for over 20 years. This works like a dream.
We also continue to put on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music even now together.
We like and are thrilled to produce music.
We have lucky to go to the places in the world that we always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth hours of the Grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of large bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement from a group of friends shows.
A band is coming out of a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound gardens on their tour. We are pleased to be friends with them all and honored us to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like that you stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) has hit us 13 years ago. This alone is a lot more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all are happy to be alive and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friend, why musical ways have opened that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and its music. It couldn't go better.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to perish this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of music, this reminds you that you have to keep track of the music and what they have called into life without being a famous rock star.
What reminders do you have of your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) was killed.
We were disappointed to have used so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. If I hear a song or photos, I think of what an incredible person Andy was and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore have chosen the band for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band loved us best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That's really exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he likes.
Who was you influenced as a bassist?
From so many+
One of the first ones I find is the spirit butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that like me.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge alive, although it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I have mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find this great because it is worth hearing this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could work slightly easily. But there are also other songs such as The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, even though they have some positives on themselves.
Both came to me the tears when I heard how Ed played them.
I think when you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - e.g. if you lose a family member or a friend - that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embodied for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical investigations
The former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is a 25-year prisoner for violation of human rights during his government period (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is four times operating and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congress Member and his personal doctor, told TV that Fujimori would be examined for three days in the Peruvian Hospital Instituteo Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that, according to Fujimori, he could be congratulated for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish this because he considers him innocent.
He was operated four times in tongue cancer and he lost 18 kilograms of weight. Further diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the abdominal glands, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood transfusion problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been located in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death swadron of the Peruvian army, who was secretly engaged during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official decree, led by Uruguay President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, launches their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region
The next Wednesday, Mujica meets with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón. According to the Uruguay president, this will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collection of the Uruguayians living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," announced the presidential office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for Calderón's support as regards the incident with France, when the French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries who still appear as a tax paradise from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and caused a request from his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chaired by the G20, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and industrialized countries in the world since November. Since January this year, an agreement has been established on the exchange of tax information to avoid double charges with the South American country.
In recent years the Uruguay Government has attempted to accelerate the concreation of agreements on the exchange of tax information to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and countries which have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been established at business level since 2004, which has contributed to the growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The snurrable installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought intimately for the rescue of the Princess Peach from the clues of the evil bowser for 25 years, but until now he has never been in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he fights for the love of the girl in Stereo technology.
The game that comes to the shops of all over the world this month has been tailored from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Nintende 3DS, with which no special glasses can be played three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain in the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo, which has been developed for this console from the beginning" because until now, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adapted to existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo pointed out that although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "acceptable" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "light" to capture the less sculpted users.
Afterwards, the experts can turn a "second round" over the various games that become ever more difficult.
Moreover, users in real time can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects" must always be played three-dimensionally.
This trip to the three-dimensional world also means returning the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo twinks to the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The turbulent installer must overcome with dangers spicked platforms to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player strikes news in the movements, the environment, the clothing and the enemies - and a "playable" luigi.
Colom charges for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would deliver the former governor Alfonso Portillo to be responsible for the conspiracy of $70 million in the United States.
This is how the U.S. application for Portillo's delivery ends so that it can be put to court there.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision on the independence of justice and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He stressed that during his government he did not intervene in court decisions and made all the exempt applications he was notified.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and severe body injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exempted to condemn the former President of the Staate (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation is clarified in Guatemale and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was freely dismissed for 120 million Quetzals in the Ministry of Defense during his reign, and this negotiation prevailed the extradition, but the Minister put in contradiction and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was launched to avoid marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Aid Organization have led to important results: 6000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported in this quarter of a century to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, the more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday at an event in the former works buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people participated, was taken account.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with a low level of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
The recent festival in Sant Andreu took part in numerous responsible bodies and institutions who have worked with the club during these 25 years.
Participation of political representatives in different directions at election times proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the president of the Generalitat (Parlament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and former Mayor and currently left-green City Council of Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows to fight against difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he works," he explained.
Occupational house where giant parties were organized was cleared
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve householders left the building yesterday afternoon without opposition.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 have found an end on the street of Balmes.
Twelve people volunteered to leave the building that they kept illegally occupied and organized huge festivals in which the neighborhood had driven to despair. The relocation took place on judicial order without police intervention.
After the relocation, the door lock was changed to avoid a similar situation.
"The accession will be controlled from now on," the house manager confirmed.
The house owners who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. They also painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially boxes with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated that lasted up to two days and the tenants driven to despair.
In addition to the building there is a discothek, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained Europe Press that her business would have been reduced by 80% since the beginning of the housework.
The owner of the Discothek pointed out that the house owners made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros while they cost 10 euros in the Discothek.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place was displayed by the neighbors because of restraint, while, according to their statement, the noise did not touch the visitors of the disco, but by the housekeepers, and in particular by the guests of the festivals organized there, and, according to the statements of the angry neighbors, has been increasingly and longer in recent weeks.
The discothek's controller explained that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building that for the last nine months no rent should be paid.
The Guardia Urbana (City Police) also confirmed that in recent weeks she had received more complaints from the neighbors.
The Chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - Volksparty) at the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested that the building be cleared immediately and the problems of bourgeois cooperation and the downcoming of the district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last few months, the house owners had been occupied in all floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some, there were even thieves.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to the injustice and to intervene against the a social acts in the building."
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 a.m., the police approached the Montral No. 35 road after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the invitation to tender except for the disputes about the Honorars.
The urban invitation to tender on the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona to the new one.
In the mid-1980s, at the climax of the corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its shame script on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the decline of the CMB in 1987, the park became the ceiling of Barcelona again in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that are not spread in north-south direction, but upwards ( mountains) and downwards (mere).
The collection of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, no longer served the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the yogabiary.
As far as the city was issued in September a giant invitation, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or someone's in favour of putting gates on the land.
The question is of itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also from a reflection on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent subject that can take two members of this old caste, which meet in the elevator.
And exactly this fact provides the substance for one of the rare consents between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" after the attack on the coast to talk about the "Front on the Mountains" unless the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out on the green apples.
"You should assume from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect, for whom the title "Tour of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it is not to be "presented as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas in which it needs to be dealt."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal as a "intellectual challenge", which is in itself "some dangers".
Risks as a result of the "unsecurity in the design of a public space today" according to the experiences of the 1980s that had their "swan singing" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is its own limitation on what can be built.
"Restrict something always means to define the next step," i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [in relation to General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who holds close to the question, feels simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not towards Barcelona" for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "found on deaf ears," although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given its body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain is to the city of the guide letter that enables the architects to participate in the debate, even though he expresses his "double" to whether this technical profile should be the multidisciplinary teams called into life (just the right one), he says, "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since in the tendering conditions a global view of Collserola was missing: "There were 16 competitions written in the cross section," he says, "on the mountain lake axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that views the area in its entirety."
This has led at least in his case to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the stripes are fitted directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between town and green zones.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the author of the Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the process that is led against him because of suspicious expression.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the author of the Casino Red has forgiven him before the Second Tribunal of the District, which leads the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for expression.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to be seen, which is supposedly forced him to pay a sum of money to allow the city administration to approve the secret operation of the Wetthaus.
After the offence, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panist mayor, which was arrested for 30 days on September 2nd.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place, he stayed 49 days after a second detention warrant after the official of the Minister of Público rejected the crimes for bribery and organised crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prisoner because he thought he had bestowed the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million Pesos. On the other, he remained only a few hours in the middle security tract, as murder threats were against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as an inmate of the urban prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the secretary of the Second Criminal Tribunal of the District, Jorge Yánez, sent him a detention order, which found that after the nearly two months of investigations, there were sufficient evidence to make Jonás guilty of the payment of 1.5 million Pesos to the representatives of the lawhouse in order to open it in return.
This Monday, the commissioner of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez asked Judge José Luis Pecina to make the mayor's brother the punishment, so he will be set free in the next hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had fixed the damage and who the owner of the lawhouse expressed forgiveness. However, the lawyer held the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken, and there are no claims to be made against the process, nor is any compensation required.
After hearing the commander of the lawhouse at 15.50 a.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set on a free foot.
The judiciary, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he had been released and his case would be put to the file.
He also informed him about the judicial order for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the aircraft accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake and other seven people died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results of the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven persons died indicate that the helicopter with his entire undeserved structure was directly piled against the ground, without the pilot could have launched an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communication and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, where the helicopter lost the ribbon, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopters were found in the investigations in the field where the machine had come down.
"In the search no plane parts were found in other places, the impact covered the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the conditions for passenger transportation.
The area shows a scratch of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present it is priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director-general of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliare (secretariat for aircraft and assistance services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of Estado Mayor Presidencial had flew with flight speed and flew the plane to a soft deck.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the crash."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, included six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual speed:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visibility flight, which means that the team had had to have sufficient view during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the further flight to the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deeply hanging clouds rose up.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area for the clouds with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Repulsion point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. There may have been neither a loss of control over the plane nor a deviation from the route before the blow.
Distributing the residuals of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to this date indicates that the helicopter had been poured out of straight and side direction.
The pattern of the dispersed airplane residuals suggests that the helicopter had poured up on the ground with its unreleased structure.
No indications on fire or explosion:
The residuals of the plane offer no fire or explosion at the accident site.
The latest research results indicate several ground contacts.
Aeroplane parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level in the local investigations. The site is decisive and shows a scrapping of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably went to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area that went beyond the locked area at the accident site, no dispersed aircraft parts could be found, which strengthened the assumption that the unearthed airplane structure had been piled against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
The Mexican Social Insurance Institute leads a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by specialists in the IPN.
The Instituteo Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexiko Social Insurance Institute) announced that a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" is to be found in conjunction with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investgación Médica en Bioquímica (Division for Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students of postgraduate studies at Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at Centro de Investgación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports places of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 a.m. tests are carried out with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation started at Cuauhtémoc Sports Square (in the west of the state of México) and continued since 8 October at Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México).
If the target is reached from 500 to 600 investigators, the study will continue at the sports site of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed at the north of the capital district of Morelos.
He stated that the aim of the study was to learn the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of diabetes, he said that three thousand children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 should fill with the consent and under the supervision of their parents with nutrition-related questionnaires.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family disease history to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or renal impairment.
In addition, it suggested that on the above Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, tallen sum), their blood pressure and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (experience of the identification of genes related to obesity in childhood).
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out in the light of the concern of healthcare personnel about the alarming weight increase in young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years, the proportion of fat-ly boys increased by 77 percent and that of the girls with obesity increased by 47 percent. Also overweight was dramatically increased," the specialist of the IMSS emphasized.
He stated that the search for genetic marks was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from the other peoples.
He stated that an average (e) Mexican (in) of 65 percent indian American, 30 percent in European and 5 percent in African origin was reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are incapable of burning out the surplus of the energy taken to us (Calonia) so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants was in a comprehensive study of the children in which it would be found whether they showed a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and on the inner arm (adardosis), which indicate the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stadium.
All information would be treated confidentially and would notify the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors will explain to parents all measurement results and propose changes in lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement in everyday life, spending the most of the day before the TV and using means of transport instead of walking shortly.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake and genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt by UNAM prevents holes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM developed with polymers modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs that go out of the street were not considered, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 holes when the rainy period in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City Area of the Valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, warned and assured that if the expulsion and maintenance of the asphaltment were adequately damaged, the number of strokes are significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Stagelöcher from a technical point of view", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, developed with polymer-modified asphalts to produce a similar mixture of asphalt, which, however, has a greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalts in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road basin and thus avoid the emergence of holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the worst part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, of which part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part is low - the so-called malthenes. Together, they give the road cover its characteristic tehelastic behavior.
Zähelastic behaviour of the asphalt means that at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C, it is very tough and almost fixed at 50°C, while it is breached at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not equal, but changes on a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer reported.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City would have a flexible road cover, consisting of six material layers, of which the last three asphalts included.
Between the upper layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small, asphalted and then fortified stones.
Each single stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles are continued to move on it and powers are produced, this layer allows a good distribution of force in the street.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he said, "a last layer is laid out, the so-called drag layer consisting of tiny stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical strength than the wear layer and it needs to produce friction.
The majority of forces receive and distributed by this road cover also needs an appropriate thickness and the material from which it consists must be retained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be taken into account, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain is moist, water is drowned into the layer and is only difficult to resume. This causes a deviation of all layers of the road basin and therefore the appearance of holes.
When a beating hole arises, he said, "the deck layer will be carried off first, while the wear layer will only be affected afterwards. But the damage does not arise immediately, but it is a process that would need to be retained in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexican National Research System) said that the vehicle load is another important cause for the emergence of holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road basin should always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this system is complied with in order to avoid frequent strokes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research work was still allowed to wait for itself, for example, about asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries and with which the strokes were easy to repair without high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th male title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca left empty in granting the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winning stage, displaying a silver crown and the band that she proved to be a new Miss Colombia.
With this night's result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the departamento is already on 14 misses and Melina is a member of the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who almost held the crown. Among the proclaimed misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Maandica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Garcére (2008).
The big question that many today ask is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every presentation that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she was elected to the queen of the police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles that also received the beauty royals Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of the Miss Colombia with home.
The first factor, which is decisive for the jury's decision to appoint it for the first Miss, is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you the strongest and why?" which was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
"I'm reading a lot, I think quite in the literature, I think it's a kind of to civilize itself, ultimately I believe that the book that was the strongest for my childhood, 'The little prince' is a very profound book.
At the moment I read `Schuld and Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we all should read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that `Leidenschaften' has.
An answer that came to little affection, first because of the term `sich zivilize' and second, because she had not specifically explained how each book she mentioned had influenced it.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little `the little prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the preferred person who had found all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy competition Easter, public agreement on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealousy, which the Queen stressed, which could not shine on the stage."
And this was noticed at their first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and at their two elevators at the crowning celebration.
Although she was safe, she lacked the strength and vibration that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned to Miss, "proves that the candidate who won most prizes during the competition will not eventually become Queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about their interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of national beauty competition.
It will already have his reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty, they were looking for a woman who was engaged in the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the body and focus on the social feelings that she had worked with projects before participating in the competition," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with its defects of the derrians and the fibrosis, which they noticed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good diet habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body that there was better "but her problem with fibrosis at the abdomen, which was hard to notice for me, expressed her score on the last day."
In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this prize, which will be awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a grievous prediction was created after the appearance in the bathing suit, which should be true in the night. It was shrouded that Raymundo Melina had given a comforting price to not let them come into the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that Melina arrives from today's reign, not as Queen, but as Princess, a position that gives you the opportunity to represent at the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, she will enter the history as one of the queens who had escaped the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
As a man who identified "Alfonso Cano", a Lofoscopic from Cali went into history.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4th, a Lophoscopic of the Investigation Unit of the Prosecutors (CTI) from California as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces of Colombia) by comparison of the fingerprints.
From the seven lophoscopicists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had a willing service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to enter the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify.
In 2000, he moved to Valle over and after the completion of the necessary courses specialized in lofoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to frictions, i.e. the hand and foot.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big expected him.
He flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca on Friday night.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that one of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore he should take the tenfinger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when the investigator reached the place where the body was located, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, because it did not resemble the figures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no bart, was dressed like a farmer in the area, didn't wear a glasses and was much thiner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cell and a pocket lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
Another night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the Chief of the FARC.
In search of tracks
For a dactyloskope from Sijín in Cali, the wording given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
The dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopeists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When arresting, many offenders present false statements or they do not have any.
We take them the fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to rip a piece of wall out of a house at a thief, because the thief had just built up in this place with his hand when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for taking fingerprints. But in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be discharged or burdened.
A dead man was recently found surrounded by snaps bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspicious, and in fact a fingerprint was agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the offence was committed.
A Dactyloskopist of the CTI said that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a tape is used for taking.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the personnel office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without IDs," said the expert of the CTI.
He meant not everything was as it was shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is shining, neither is everything you're about is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "empörers" demand the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on the Zuccotti square.
A large part followed the relocation command and switched its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement requested New York's authorities on Tuesday when they tried to enter the Manhatt Square again, after they had been cleared from the place in the morning grey and tried to place another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators joined the Zuccotti place, on which they wanted to join with a judicial arrangement which allowed the "empörers" to enter the new tents at this point. In the meantime, another part of the movement held at the cleaning command and occupied a park further north in the city where nine arrests came.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place, we are gathering in another place and keep the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray claimed that the answer of the "empressors" to the relocation of her tent camp, which was direct ordered by Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of New York, came to court, where judge Lucy Billings issued a arrangement that banned the violent relocation of the place and approved the demonstrator the tent.
In addition, the "Empörten" occupied a new park, which is located at the crossing of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue near the entry into the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but afterwards the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that there had been hundreds of people in this place, where a decree of religious leaders had also arrived as signs of their support for the members of the movement and for intermediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti place (a private property site) remains closed in expectation of a judicial hearing which is still set for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the premises taken in the morning grey should be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators driven from the square carried photocopys of this judicial arrangement and distributed them. They even gave them some policemen watching the place, which resulted in "some small collisions", as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had beat demonstrators.
The judicial instruction prohibits the authorities to clear members of Occupy Wall Street from the place, as well as the application of "results adopted after the occupation and forbid the demonstrators to return to the park with their tents and other things they used before."
Mayor Bloomberg explains in front of the press that, due to this judicial arrangement, the reopening of the space for public transport and demonstrators has been lifted. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish with tents and sleeping bags in that place.
The mayor personally defended the premises carried out in the morning grey of the Zuccotti square, where almost 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "pronounced the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the arrangement for the restoration of the place because he had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstration, but to break the laws and in some cases to damage other people," for "some businesses had received threats" and the residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"Bloomberg was anxious in the morning grey, showing that it is essential to protect the financial interests and not to protect the interests of the North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor "not to respect the freedom of the press".
The responsible people of "Occupy Wall Street" informed them that they thought to organize "great actions" for Thursday, together with municipal organisations and trade unions, to remember the two months that the protests have already lasted since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens Assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas television program.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (Balladensänger) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, appeared on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and a very special virgin Maria will live.
Today, CTV spread pictures of the television program, in the Anderson – also for the dissemination on the Internet of a self-turned porno, where she appeared together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, as a virgin Mary with a doll in the shot to represent Jesus.
In the scene Peters, a famous Canadian comician of Indian origin, who recently worked as a moderator at the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" mission by Charlie Sheen as Jesuskind.
The Christmas program of CTV is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far away from this controversy.
On one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called North American Kim Kardashian as "Hure".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since March last, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake that was in a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced in World War II.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo assessed the damage to $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakened despite the difficult world economy.
After three quarters of the case, the data on gross domestic product were intended to finally conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% of the quota charged for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The restoration can be explained by the sale of machines for reconstruction of the territories destroyed by the earthquake and the subsequent tsoenami.
In fact, firms increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the decline of 0.9% in capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unintentional increase.
Nevertheless, the actual change in the Japanese economy is not exclusively based on key-national concerns that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan has been awakened, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, encountered by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure jobs.
The stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - flee into one of the "currencies of refugees" of investors who are in front of the Eurozone's school memorial crisis and the thirsty forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results back to the yen notation from July to September.
While the markets continue to defeat the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the ongoing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of flooding in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the Yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy yesterday, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are really not very fascinating.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States had shown clearer signs of slowing economic development.
The indicator, which presumes the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the Bremse would have been drawn in the largest economic potential.
Because he dropped by four tenths up to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is 100, after it has fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens gives rise to doubts
Papadimos says that savings would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums of peripheral countries and broadening uncertainty, Greece continues to be lost in the labyrinth that leads out of the major European school monument crisis.
The impression that the "consens" of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than to a genuine conviction of political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Luke Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days that he appointed might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democrcia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and never withdraw his request for new elections at the date of 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the Summit of 26 October", Dadimos assured yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will reach its climax tomorrow with the confidence voting for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes for employment promotion, reform of disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax retraining are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara’s communication does not give rise to doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing."
The conservative leader went a step too far with its challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8000 million Athens urgently, and he made it clear that he would not approve a declaration of obligation on the fulfilment of savings measures.
However, the European Commission, who is still irritated because of the impact of the poker game with Papandreu Referendum, reiterated yesterday's request that it should not be remedied: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties would "not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the Troika would "return very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government, "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knees still have feds for a while.
Queen Sofía: "That are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "prevailing" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a predominant position in the role of smallest finances worldwide".
Yesterday, Queen Sofía of Spain reminded us that in the last two decades Spain has developed as the second donor for this means of international cooperation. The "Wesen" rests on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of confidence in humans".
During the last year, the Queen invented the Fifth World Summit on Smallest Credits in Valladolid. She was convinced that it was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations until 2015 and "in particular the goal, the number of persons living with incomes of less than one dollar per day, so under the "armuts limit".
Spain " continues to work on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsible," said Queen Sofia, hoping that the initiatives and contributions that will be taken up by the summit, which will take place until Thursday, "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" are guaranteed as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The summit on smallest loans is not only a forum for debates but also a platform for "two basic objectives".
The Queen said that it is intended that 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty limit.
The conception of the smallest credit goes back in Spain and the rest of the world on the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "before years" which the Queen Sofia judges as an "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financing instrument described it as a "wonderful idealists who have prescribed the fight against poverty" and whose work they have known for 15 years when the queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet the loan strategy on site.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we have been able to observe a continuous development," the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday gave her the assessment as "family novice" in Valladolid and as "president of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her talk by animating the attendants to participate in the debate and to find solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it is a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic trees, that it is a "lasting commitment".
Jiménez believed that smallest loans would be a "ernest and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty" and that the governments of the industrial states now "more than ever" would have to work according to solidary criteria and should not allow solidarity to be victimized by the crisis.
For Spain, smallest loans are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, claimed "the success", "marginized" people who are always standing in front of closed doors" and open to the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, the attendants welcomed in a city that "their gates, mounted by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to choose EU Presidents on the basis of general voting
The first day of the Christian Democrat Congress (CDU on Monday, November 14th in Leipzig, left for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but in autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who consider government policy with regard to Greeks today and perhaps Italy's tomorrow as too lax.
The European Commission's presidency request proposed by the Bureau was almost unanimously adopted.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, ten had included the voice.
The standing ovation, which was lasting several minutes because of its intervention events, Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, was no doubt open by the three Ministers of Finance to Europe.
The main idea of the Chancellor, as well as the applications, is the following slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected by the European Union's control of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area; however, this could also be reflected in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voting," to give Europe a face."
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which were clearly Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Surely, it is little likely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is against the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, the delegates have rejected the proposal to weight each country in the Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which is obviously a boosting of Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who was calm about the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win its congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty who would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request for the importance of the "German-French friendship" devotes a section, Angela Merkel does not call on France to the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the highest humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud represent in sick news?
After family aid, UMP and government are now launching the sick news.
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux, to visit a family aid case and to present a speech on the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence from the state, which has always been returning since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is intended to undermine the economy in a hard trial, but on the other hand, not less presupposes to an axis of the right presidency campaign, the majority intends to focus on workers’ health reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government sees the introduction of a fourth day of carcinogens before taking into account a sickness notification for private workers.
In good German, this means that a sick person would lose the salary of four days without permission of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to provoke anger, but would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And those who took a more symbolic character: to allow the public officials an unpaid cardiac day in the disease case (to date, there is no time for them, in contrast to the three carnival days in the private sector).
While these questions are in the debate, the majority also reiterates fraud, with this time targeting the abuse associated with work absence.
"Controlling will be much more important, and in addition, these are refunds when required", Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the broadcaster RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of sickness messages seems a little unproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives that have worn most frequent fruit.
The French are no more commonly ill than those elsewhere in Europe.
However, first of all we have to stay with the national figures.
According to the CNAM State Disease CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid out in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health Science, daily surveys in 2008 represented €11.3 billion of health spending.
46% of this amount fell with regard to maternity holidays, unemployed accidents and 54% with regard to disease holidays, which amounted to EUR 6.2 billion.
And then 2.5% health spending.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, in 2010, the French were granted on average only 14.5 days of sickness, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
One mean value that distorts certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 responded to French workers have not taken any day of sickness.
Another study recorded this time by health insurance shows that 37% of the sickness reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Thus, compared with their European neighbours, French workers do not tend more than elsewhere to work inability.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French, State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (based on disease or otherwise) oscillated in France between 10% and 11% compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sick news represents a varied low share of blackwork.
With regard to fraud, only a weak outlet is achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to the fact that there are systmatic controls in disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public University for Education and Training of Technicians and Engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 realized short-term sickness messages, which are home to 37.050 cases, were unjustified or too long.
In the systematically controlled cases of diseases of more than 45 days, there were under 1.2 million 11% of "unappropriate or unjustified" cases, which are 132,000.
In all, this, therefore, makes 169.000 "unjustified" cases to several million workers who have claimed to be sick.
A figure representing only a weak outlet, for example, those of blackwork.
According to the UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this question published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily compensation, and thus much more than the defying of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to capture its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had announced before the Parliament the fact that the one hundred days of his government did not allow the Union to do this.
"To continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support for our European partners as well as a new budget adaptation programme," said the Head of Government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's confidence voyage on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the European Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, since the country's participation within the euro area" was on the game, as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the state deficit of the country's 9% of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights deny the new savings
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the already approved measures as regards a attempt to escape from the school memorial crisis, but foretold that his party would not be ready to obtain an additional saving.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said on the occasion of a parliamentary meeting of his Party New Democracy.
He had declared himself ready to reduce budgetary deficit and debt as well as to fight against waste, but he was opposed to any policy that would undermine economic upturn.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary duties entrusted Commissioner of the EU who had prevented IMF and EU not to release the necessary loan over EUR 8 billion without written warranty of all parties on their support of the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had answered that his word would be sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure from the German authorities.
Euthanasia and accompanied free death must be legalised, so an expert body
The Canadians live in refusal of death, as shown in a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The Board stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors cooperated in painful treatment to provide the best painful means, as well as the cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to death.
Only 9% of Canadians are actually able to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and take dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Royal Society of Canada, where six experts were involved in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government modify the penal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and Euthanasia, where this choice is set, in patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
The experts quote a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the earth.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th rank, the study notes that "the medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the theme of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painstilling resources, reports the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of the Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
From the whole country, the rate of 86% of deaths entered in the hospital in Quebec is the highest.
In the matter of Euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report draw attention to conclusions which are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already devised, to make no changes to the penal law on Euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
But now, according to the experts, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would lead to misuses in their application, i.e. the practice of Euthanasia or accompanied suicide from incompetent or non-consensive persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such transgressions are encountered in the countries where Euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, confirmed at a teleconfirm.
"Euthanasie is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support the Euthanasia
Let us note that, according to an angus-rid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of the Canadians had already taken up in favour of Euthanasia, since they believe that they allow people to milden their suffering at the end of their life course.
And 66% believe that the content of a legalisation of Euthanasia does not result in giving the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
As regards those who have already practiced a accompanied suicide, the respondents consider 41% that they should not be persecuted criminally.
As regards maintaining or stopping the resources in patients, situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Similarly, in its Recommendation Index, they suggest that the penal law should indicate that the withdrawal of the funds for which a legal rejection has provided should not be considered criminal.
The Expert Assembly also calls on health professionals to be trained in respect of the end of the life, and to fear this without criminal persecution.
The Board stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors cooperated on painful treatment in order to provide the best painful means, as well as the cancer cases.
Lastly, the Board calls for, as regards the resources already used in the Canadian institutions for healthcare, to reduce pain relief or to reduce life-sufficiency measures, at least to consider them, as they were not the same as Euthanasia, to reduce physical pain and to reduce them to the same procedures.
Other experts' reserves
Some experts in the field of healthcare have already presented reservations regarding the conclusions of the Expert Report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has referred to the attitude of the reporting experts as "extreme", as it does not set any limits on the Euthanasia practice in the final phase.
"This opens the gates for a situation in which everyone who is living tired and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him in his suicide," said RA Deschamp, who had visited a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social impact of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guiding lines and commitments in a society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which it titulated as "Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is self a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the report on the non-existence of abuse in certain countries where Euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to withdraw power
Damascus is a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The Partisanen Baschar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Authentics.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Baschar al-Assads, which, thanks to the support of Russia and a "complot" against the country, has been strengthened yesterday.
Two days before the outlet of Syria through the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had held their position in favour of a department from President Assad.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan was yesterday the Arab Prime Minister who had asked President Baschar al-Assad to put down his power in Syria, in which 40 civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"Light Baschar the interest of his country, he would depart, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said King of Jordan, neighboring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat Chief Ahmet Davutoglu, on the other hand, complained that the attempts of the Turkish mediation that had been addressed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and who can't please them," he said in presentation on Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily rough attitude.
On the other hand, the United States have welcomed the "destructiveness of consensus against Assad and the acts of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions taken by the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Community, United States, EU, Arabic Liga and countries such as Turkey have attacked an ever sharper tone in the face of the repressions in Syria," says Mark Toner, a spokesman of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government force in the region of Dar'a in the south of Syria died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSDH.
Two more civilians, according to this NGO, were killed at "Shussing and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the bellowed city of Hom.
At the occasion of a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim still considered that the country "taxed to the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has responded with emphasis on the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his duties, which represents his assessment of a "dangerous step".
"I wouldn't give up Syria," he added, under the harassment, "the competitors that were sworn against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syrian, the Arab League is currently examining a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wishing to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed himself in favour of the dispatch of UN observers to assist civilians against repressions of the regime that afterwards he was incapable of his "Paranoia".
A new meeting of the Liga is planned for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan adopted on 2 November on crisis auction, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the armed cities as well as the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergej Lawrow has classified the decision of the Arab League yesterday as "unorrekt" in order to prevent the support of any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already advised Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be prepared for sacrifices
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, demanded a little more time from the markets to form its staff and implement a programme that "opfer" demands to recover creditworthiness lost during the last months of the government of Berlusconi.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiations with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers' unions.
It was his task to call a cabinet into Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the discussions, after having met with the President-in-Office.
On the other hand, Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Members, had been waiting for Mario Monti to put a voluntary trust to Parliament until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The votes will be picked up in the presentation of a list of strings presented by M. Monti, which will undoubtedly reach from a dozen of ministers to the Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the previous nervousity of the stock exchange and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government programme, he stressed that it is "sure that the markets will show themselves strictly and polite".
The president's order was infringed by the markets, but the disturbance had increased again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers should set up a high-level technocrate staff, although he had emphasized that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Members, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
M. Monti has committed itself to work in all urgency in the sense of the goal, to make Italy the "renewed protagonists" in Europe.
A spokesman of the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "we have not changed our diagnosis to the Italian economy even taking account of the new government".
The EU, who is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budget balance in 2013, despite the savings plans that have been set up in these last months, has particularly requested new hardships.
Emma Marcegaglia", Chief of the Heads of Italy, which will meet on Tuesday on Monti, also depends on the necessity of economic recourse", that a country which has no growth to show that cannot respect deficit figures."
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "epochen change" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "requirement of trustworthiness" as well as an "other Italy", says the editorial authors.
The great unknown of this was the longevity of his rod.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferential elections, since Italy has now come up to EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
Russian scientists help the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wjascheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a explosive capsule used with a nuclear weapon, so on Monday, a NGO specialized in nuclear risks confirmed.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report by the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents from this UN Agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA had informed its "ernstige concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to in-depth study of the AIEA documents on the side of ISIS, the Danilenko born in 1934 apparently had been working in a Soviet militarynuclear center in Tscheljabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was supposed to have left the center to establish a company in Kiev, which produces "Nano-Diamants".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In their last report, the AIEA mentioned strong indications that the Iranian development of a nuclear pregnant system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only in this technology but also, as a national member of the Agency told, has worked his entire career in this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of its country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
The crimes and delicates directed against Muslims have risen by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial or religiously motivated crimes have been slightly reduced, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, either during the same period or have increased only slightly.
According to these data, the total number of violence crimes committed against Muslims had increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% in 2010, while an increase in 13% in violence against Catholics, a decline of 4% in crimes directed against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hass-motivated crimes" had increased to 6.628 cases in very weak size, including 47.3% by differences in races and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the Human Rights Organization emphasized Human Rights First. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible member of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, as he estimated, that this could be done by improving the political attitude towards the "hass crime".
The "hass crime" represents itself in the US federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings in order to punish violent acts directed against race, skin color, religion, or origin, and now also involves criminal acts of sexual belonging.
Twitter walks the platform and is more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service similar to that of Facebook once more.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enable better readable live retraining of the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are persecuted and which follow your messages.
This allows them to find out whether they allow them to track their news, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general internet distribution on Monday"in August with a small percentage of users", the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner announced before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was well-known for his little instinctive functioning, fitted with something esotherically anticipating text (RT for referencing the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre and autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec unmaniement plus comparable a cellui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users debated on this innovation using certain "Tweets" via the Internet.
"This is non-profit, oppressive and similar to very Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function" activity will help me to better track certain elements of my flux twitters," proclaimed @dannykron stream.
Austria
Subscription of a "Golden Budget Rule" to the Constitution
On Tuesday, the government of the large social democratic/Christian coalition in Austria decided to include a "golden budgetary rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and to avoid any degradation of rating agencies in Austria's top-bonity (AAA).
It was the socio-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although public Austrian government debt is 74.6%, so far above the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay does not fall to a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros additionally each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister of Auβen.
Austria also calls for the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government would at that time require the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the public balance of accounts into the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country that had included such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 onwards, the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% GDP limit, while regional countries should be balanced households, as well as communities.
The aim is to terminate budget debts in the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criteria laid down by the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on monetary markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japan's power would re-intervene in monetary markets if the yen should continue to rise.
"When we fix an excessive volatility" in the Yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we did it last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day Tokyo had sold Yen massively against dollars to reduce the Japanese currency value, which has been taxing a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
However, the yen has steadily risen over it, dipped by buyers of investors who view the Yen as "relief value" in these uncertain times of global economic decline and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has been shattered among the symbolic lat of 105 Yen near the levels that had treaded the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 Yen, the euro more than 160 Yen.
This steam fire of the Japanese devise damages the exports of the archipelago, since it depicts the costs of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income that Japanese companies have taken from abroad, as they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami that destroyed the Tohoku region (North East), for its rebuilding," M. Noda, who fears that this degradation of the Yen could kill the weak respiratory already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter, the third economic world power has gained -1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time this year thanks to the rapid export increases and the consumption of the "plombed" households by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the degradation of the Yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
On the other hand, Minister of Finance Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all suspicious measures to deprive the Yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has noted, however, that the BoJ has already launched "adapted measures", which he is promising to read that there is no additional currencies to be expected on Wednesday.
During the last meeting at the end of October, the Bank had increased its national bond purchases by 5,000 billion Yen (47 billion euros) to cut the 55,000 billion Yen (519 billion euros) coverage amounts that it had used for various purchases of financial titles to overflow the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates fasten to the height, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of collapsing is constantly undermined by European figures.
Despite the adoption of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened country are steadily increasing.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, also drifted this Tuesday, 15 November, a little more into negative fluids.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.4%, London by 0.4%.
"On the basis of the new tensions with regard to the yields of national bonds in the difficult euro area, the global share markets continue to spend part of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the risk of plugping," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo, which, on its part, suffers from the renewed fear of market participants with regard to the capacity in Europe that the school memorial crisis continued to last, had closed with a low of 0.7%.
""Japan as well as the rest of the world has its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving to limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revival of concern about the future of the euro area damages the single currency which continues its Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 Dollers, so it yielded 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange agents, after the CDU, party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the convention on Monday, she had made a request, which, in particular, provides for the possibility of leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union in trouble.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
Italy's and Spain's loan interest rates remain at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% at 10 years, which the Spanish title grew up to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
On the other hand, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is located in the market visa, as the parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The interest shear ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year leagues has once reached a new historical high.
Expected growth in the euro area
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter by household consumption, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Statistical Federal Office INSEE had revised the Baisse of the figures of the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that the economic experts are most disturbed.
Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
It is expected that a first summit of the whole euro area will be expected at 11 a.m. while the EU Commission warns against the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over Dogmen
If there is a topic that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity influence the purchase power and the competitiveness of the companies in direct measure.
It is reasonable to take a election meeting, to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it sends the overall economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should find their views on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is leading to a duplicatement of electricity demand by the year 2050, a huge proportion of the world's population should not be abandoned to a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to reduce fossil resources to continue to produce electricity without forgetting the compelling need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has been elapsed from the ecological debate, to fight against climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of this parameter.
Therefore, Germany continues to be isolated in its decision to avoid nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision to find a substitutionable source of replacement, nor in Switzerland, which intends to only build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to call only some states, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
On the other hand, the United States decided to integrate another unit to their park by rebuilding the Three Mile Island work that was put down after the nuclear accident.
However, even though the German model, which is based on renewable energy sources, is occasionally set as an example, the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The election in Berlin will deteriorate, in the form of a defense of the electricity price, an increase in energetic dependence on import gas, especially on Russia, in the form of an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unfriendful effects will already be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is European table leader with regard to wind energy, from which it refers to 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, which are alternately used with wind energy; its CO2 output and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the persistentness of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity account, unlike our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy represents a key role in competitiveness as well as an industrial stability spider on national grounds, the French companies have a advantage because of the most affordable electricity in Europe.
Every significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the energy price, which will read the precious statements about the re-engineering of our country and the defence of the purchasing power to illusion.
Inquiries showed that this is a price which the large majority of the French is equally low to pay, as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us note that our country's energy policy has enabled it to build an industry of 125,00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings an enormous amount of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France had decided to rise from nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would be victimized, and the annual 6 billion euros in investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink up more and more.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to function on sixty years if the decline of its producer is preprogrammed?
To solve the energetic equation, you must admit that there is just as little a miracle for the production of electricity as a devil's work.
The low CO2 solutions developed by Areva to use nuclear power and renewable energy are the evidence of the complementarity of energy sources.
It is absolutely imperative for nuclear power to maintain the highest level of security.
In France we have a security authority that conducts uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as at the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams who have been named because of their professionality are just to be occupied by the security proposal.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disturbances.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions, so he has gone without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was sworn by reactor construction as well as infinite human failures.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by massacres that caused the death of several ten thousand people.
The nuclear industry will draw its teachings out of this accident as it had done after the two.
As a fruit of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft which enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fantastic gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading them free rail to travel the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is inadequate and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be unresponsibly to dominate emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres that also determine economic, social and financial situation in our country.
Is immigration burden or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overload of police, court and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "land of human rights", as France himself referred.
Recently, the harassment of the official side against foreign students had shaped the weekly views, and the interior minister had occasionally announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "no talent, maurer or Kellner had needed from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from the economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this subject between the right and the left.
From the right side, Jacques Chirac's tone was attacked, which in 1976 explained that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrated workers, should not represent a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who stated in 1990, France" could not take up the entire poverty of the world".
There is only a difference in the degree of excess
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by Horden Polish clepper was divided from both right and left in 2005.
Of both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of gross movement that is desirable to the immigrants.
Francois Hollande is limited to banalities in his programme that point to partnership development to solve our "migration problems".
This concept of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections, but it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recently published work that summarizes the latest insights on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive influence of immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in immigration countries.
Restricting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears of the influence of migrants are based on the idea that these threaten to substitute local workers, in particular the less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
However, the experience shows that the immigrants are in fact much more complementary than the local wage workers, since they are exercising heavy-point jobs in sectors that are unextended in the field of employment.
The low-qualified immigrants work in sectors where local wage workers travel little, the more qualified immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not equal to the job offer.
Positive wage effect
As a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthesists, so this complementarity also creates a positive effect of immigrant access to wages and national labour market situations between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in emigrant flood results in an associated long-term increase in reall wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of idea creation and economic growth introduced by immigrants is relevant (high proportion of immigrants among American nobel prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in the European countries at a rate of about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person travelling to Germany at the age of 30 spends a net contribution of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over its lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the lack of cutting points "with the teeth".
However, these meant teeth that the immigrants should deter, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to reflect on European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed the entire 20th century over the tragedies of World War I, Totalitarism, Holocaust, Gulag, and Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some believed that it was rich to exercise the right of vote, in a direct way as possible, in order to overwhelm democracy for all time over their enemies.
It is known since Napoleon "the little man" that it was a feature of mental attitude.
The general right of election, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can become as well a "depression instrument", as it then expressed by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of violence, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe in which we are is an economic crisis, but it is also very and mostly political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek true-falsch referendum would have had doubled intelligence in this regard: once the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the distressing feeling of their impossibility, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered overcrowded.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer targeting in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to urge a success of the national referendum, which was organized in terms of the necessities and in the wrong order.
A free license for the European single-governor or a jump with connected eyes into the emptyness of nationalist withdrawal: A great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, with full right, clarified and steady, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is all Europe that is beneficial to the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are worried about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - it is all Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus every individual of the nation that has joined it.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to national sovereignty.
For it is in general whether the Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and can drive a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has a condition for decisions at European level, which cannot be liked without total democratic legality, without being sure to lead us to ruin.
After this proposal was fought by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, everyone today urges the European economic leadership.
Understand.
But this is without political integration and a stronger democracy, as they suggest citizens, would be a new foolishness and another sackgasse.
We need to take a new stage of European development.
In order to make the Republic appear in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution of the interests alone could not afford enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We must form a more integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more democratic Europe politically, a truly European sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become general
The world fair for chip cards opens its gates on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic position.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 was to end with an increase of 11% worldwide sales of microprocessorchips (EC cards, SIM card telephone), with more than 6 billion sold units.
The most important segment is the contactless technology that enables payments in public transport or balance of purchases by simply keeping the card to a reader.
Against the one year before, 320 million sold this year, 460 million contactless chip cards were to be sold worldwide!
Their market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins with regard to contactless payment on the ground after it has long been behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400.000 non-contact visacles have been spread.
However, consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless passport MasterCards this year.
To accelerate at higher speed, it is now necessary that banks equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically placing their customers on bank cards that are equipped with contactless chips in the future," announced Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A far lower percentage of devices has been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) needed to carry out these transactions.
"They've been moved."
"But they should experience a real upward development at least next year."
"We expect the sales of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to June next.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Générale had said yesterday to prepare the market introduction of an offer that enables its customers to pay without contact by phone.
Terrorist face understands, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is worried about the relationship between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
The long suspicious relationships between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sekte Boko Haram seem to confirm.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Auβenminister Abdelframe Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers has now gained certainty about it.
"The way in which both organizations are dealing with and the relationships of the secret services indicate a clear cooperation," he said without further detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigations on the kidnapping of two French in Niger last January promoted interfaces in days.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, which were kidned in a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi, were supposed to have been killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French specialities.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists in the ruins at the place of use.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the run-up calls leads to several conversational partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two conversation partners: a number leads to an Nigerian who has long been in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, who had stopped wing by Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but you must certainly wait for more clear evidence before you can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It is, however, imaginable."
"Man has been aware for years that the sect refers to financial and intellectual support from Auβen and that it is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo degrades.
In these last months, these "support services" have become increasingly obvious in their courses, as well as the talks and the operating modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the addition of suicide transmitters and the use of ever more complex explosives that bear the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community has been exercising pressure on Abuja since this time to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed considered the grouping over a long period of time as a community of Illuminates, which has not to be given special attention.
Fast success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which means in Haoussa as much as "the Western education is a shame" - pursues the establishment of a Islamic emirat in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this medieval region, the merger has rapid successes.
It politises and demands strict compliance with the Scharia, while the activists of her engaged in fighting against the wicked central government.
At first, the activists have churches, bars and authorities in the visor.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram showed themselves particularly actively with their intensified attacks against the Commissioners.
The reaction from Abuja is, however, indifferent as usual.
The army revolves the city, one counts 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its high-burgs in the north.
Last Christmas she announced herself to an attack in Jos, which demanded 80 human lives, then another one in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was debted to a suicide penetrate that occurred in Abuja’s security police headquarters - the first of his kind.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters set up a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is intended to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been disturbed by all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, at a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Ta Alain Juppé warned Boko Harem and was willing to show himself," to inform all the indications."
The world according to the Republican presidency candidates
Mid Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance regarding China, Iraq and the aid for Israel.
Can a cry-weaking America lead a complex world with simple, not saying: invaluable ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidency candidates such a way, the electors could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their competitors have repeatedly made their thundering statements as well as their statements on authics policy, traditional Republican focus.
About China, Iran and Israel aid - often undermined in no way - Slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", the middle of Romeney, threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to offend the "Worlding Manipulation" - leading topic in a America that is irritated by the immigration of all industrial branches to Asia.
Foolish run, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and only candidate who seemed to have a mature vision of aucial policy, almost as regards his emotions smiling gestures has cut off the air.
He had called for a hand-resistant but constructive exchange of conversation with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obamas).
But Huntsman is not being heard, as he stagnates in the depths of the opinions.
Reagan's Eben Image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions were to fail to stop the nuclear program.
"If I'm being chosen, I'll stop Iran," he cried.
"If Obama is reselected, they get the bomb."
In addition, he promised greater military aid to Israel and accused Obama of being guilty to this partner of obligations.
The entrepreneur, Herman Cain, second highest-ranked candidate, has a shameful dossier insight to show.
Recently, he called on to give the Chinese military threat contra, since Beijing's attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to give the fact that China has already owned military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The texanian governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, is, on the other hand, unwilling to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cards.
The withdrawal of torture against suspect terrorists by Obama in 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
You are far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auβenpolitical weight.
The current presidency counterparts, Reagan also had simple ideas and won the cold war despite all.
They recall that Obama was also a amateur and had to give water in his wine, what was the subject of antiterror.
They rightly persist on the failure of his naive twist talks with Iran, the premature deduction of his "age" from Iraq, his determination in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
However, this contradiction is not so imperative.
The population rather estimates the positive balance sheet of national security under Obama, which has been deactivated by Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to fatigue.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by reasoning that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to create its leadership position for new lives.
North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipe, which runs on the Baltic Sea Sea and connects the Western Europe directly to Russia, was operated.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to go on this event with shine and gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, have lived last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea Coast under orchestra sounding and at finesmecker buffet the inauguration of the new North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, French Prime Minister François Fillon, as well as his office school Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, turned together the tax of the valve, which transports the Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline aims to deliver 27,5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year through a first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the Sankt Petersburg region to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to Western Europe.
A second pipeline allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to the French overall consumption, is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And the eventuality of the construction of a third line on its own route is already made.
For Gazprom, the time-to-point completion of this enormous building works like a victory.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream Pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, by avoiding any tracing through third countries (Poles or Ukraine) on the roadway.
For this reason these two countries lose a little of their power: it will now be more difficult for them to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, had not been reversed to compare the North-Stream pipeline with a "new German-Sovitan Pakt" in connection with the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the topic is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of decreasing European energy, as the project hit a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, which are strong gas consumption and their gas supply are neglecting.
"This gas distributor is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new arterie that connects us in an organic way," confirmed François Fillon in the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out in what degree the huge gas contracts are also of political and economic importance.
All of this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom manager represented in Lubmin as regards gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipe is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from shipankers.
It rests on the sea ground, in about 200 metres of depth.
In their construction, mining fields dating from World War II had to be evacuated.
"Especially hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed,” Jens Müller, spokesperson of the North Stream Society.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the Fauna and Flora.
The line is a long snake of metal, heavy like 242 eiffel towers that are not interrupted throughout the length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was foreseen before the coast of Sweden, but the project responsible have removed from it, since Sweden had little effort to permanently see a Russian state society in their coasts.
"In the case of a Havarie, we close the gas vial in less than a minute," Jens Müller stated.
So in the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipe disappears into the air.
However, this case is considered as little likely by the constructors, since the sweaters were estimated to be constant by a leak per 100.000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipe is ensured by a underwater robot controlled by a sea ship for external observation purposes, as well as by a device circulating within the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, roughly one metre diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of the relocation through the direction at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device delivers the most accurate information about any deformations of the metal when it arrives.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without being subjected to the least repair.
Gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the accession, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their powers to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German societies E. ON and BASF are also integrated here (e.g. 15,5%), as well as the Dutch Gas Union and the French group GDF Suez (e.g. 9%).
These five companies have formed a company community called North Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
She has its seat in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport on prolongable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of how large the mass transported gas amount will fall", precisely Jens Müller.
The financing of gas transmission was secured to 30% of shareholders as well as 70% of bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment total was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are unable to recover their expenses, since Gazprom alone has the risk of liability.
The gas pipe comes on a sandy coastal area with birds near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas exit gates.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other figures of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipes.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gases per passing hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Moleskine now wants to re-establish the letter from an Italian company about fifteen years ago.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent on candle licensing with writing.
The notebook of moleskine is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular tape, its rubber band, the egg shell-coloured pages, as ageed over time.
The Moleskine note, however, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, who has its headquarters in Milan, decided to bring a distinguished design notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then expert consultant of the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old production technology called Mole Skin (Maulworfshaut), which is called a cotton lacquet, for example used for receipts of pollen benches.
This type of notebook was very demanded by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which was considered a avantgardist artist until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now more trademark responsible at Modo Modo.
Success takes place.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rise by 26% and are established with a drop of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far away from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook also enthusiasts as well as students and experts.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small, Italian company, which counted 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in books, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and understands to implement its identity.
"We followed the time spirit and his new need to write, which exist despite the e-mail recovery," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine company: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Reverse)" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, at the film festival in Locarno, the company also brought a band with leopard patterns on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and cultural spirit and understood diversifying its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer shells... The brand shows the entire range of articles.
A success that envys the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the Investment Fond SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and presented a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" starts.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in disabled people is always twice as high as the average average: 19% against 9% unemployment in the total population.
Disturbing?
"No, Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, emphasizes the "week of work for disabled people".
"The progress made within fifteen years is significant."
"There was the unemployment rate not twice, but three times so high."
"Not yet much to do."
However, it must be said that there are still many obstacles for disabled unemployed before getting a job.
More often, the elderly are: 37% are over 50 years (17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no abitur and there are only 10,000 disabled persons among the 2.3 million students with higher education degrees.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% in disabled people compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-employ and which form the "clear of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a association founded in 1992 that helps companies to acquire disabled workers.
So much to the real brakes.
Stay the unexplained, the mental attitudes that, although surely, develop slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS Association for the magazine La Cité indicated that the interviewed managers have "a weak level of knowledge with regard to disabled persons", which "overrepresented" is "by people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual minors".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way ahead to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was established in a 1987 law.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization who is responsible for committing contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The evidence: The number of "paying fees" establishments, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, has decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The 2005 law, which provides for contribution increases, created a strong pressure on the companies, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses real knowledge, especially in the large business groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a Happiness"
Even before they offered the "Blauen Tuesday evenings (20:45 p.m.) the foreheads, Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had not healed their pleasures that brought them the friendship game.
It would be too far taken to claim that there had been a secret consent between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Side-side on the viewer stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have been able to close peace.
Five months after the temperamentful gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had harvested nothing as praise for his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assures the brown Liller on his part.
As to the contrast between his representation in club and national elf"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I'm over the whole year, what's not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, leading Friday evening against Romania with regard to the match against France to finally shine."
However, without leaving the note of "good".
The French national team has been compulsory since the age of 7 and has led its victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he remarked.
"We just walked over the way."
"Give them to play means great luck!"
Leekens read on his part with kindness "Stolz".
"The pride to carry out a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its capacity as "nearbarn" - that France" has again become a team at a very high level", and that is little more than a year after the dream of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done so much good work," he said enthusiastic.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French National Elf) ... and to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians come out greatly," he emphasized.
"We are planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"They will notice this in the upcoming games."The game against France included.
Portugal very confidently
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento, with great optimism, sees the backplay against Bosnia this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams had missed the reality in the playback.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt for him that "La Selecçao", his national elevator, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship 2012.
In fact, for Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play and serve a opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the replay (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game over an hour, but the team was not able to impress the matter on the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, because we have not achieved an outward gate."
At home, however, in their brightly radiant Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass through in front of an audience that is supposed to be equally hesitant to the game, even if the party was announced as "very short" of course, the optimistic but clear bento said.
"We expect a very close match, but are perfectly convinced to win the overhand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have a 50% chance to be at the 2012 European Championship," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relatived.
The Portuguese forces to reach and win a gate on Friday in Bosnia.
The Bosnians, who also need a gate, can already have a difference.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not achieved an outward gate," regrets Bento.
"We will attack a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would have intended to exercise maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "no time to think"."
A good idea, subject to the condition that it is actually implemented this time.
