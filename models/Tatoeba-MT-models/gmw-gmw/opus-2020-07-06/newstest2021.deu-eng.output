A security service monitors the ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positively to the Corona infectors Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the Landratamt Dingolfing-Landau reported on Saturday evening.

Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the operation - this was the cause of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, which is built on earthberries, cucumbers, coal and red beet, but only for glazing glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with a population of about 3300 in the vicinity of Dingolfing with its large BMW work.

Infected were separated from non-infected employees on the courtyard, the terrain is now surrounded by a absperrzaun.
Greens and SPD were responsible for the government.
The two opposition fractions suggested Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect the control of the accommodations of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly reluctant if such local infections have to be intervened and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary director of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already demanded a special control program for farms with harvesters," said Environmental Expert Florian von Brunn.
"We have to monitor the hygiene conditions at work and the housing conditions from our viewpoint.
This obviously has not happened."
The outbreak came "with ansage."

Report: Seehofer is pressing for longer storage of stocks
The storage of stock data is currently exposed.
However, Minister of Federal Interior Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of stock data, instead of half a year for ten weeks.
As the "Image on Sunday" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a quick change in law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He thinks it's useful to "have already made urgently necessary adjustments in the law," the newspaper quotes from the letter.

A decision by the European Court is expected to do so.
Seehofer, however, wishes to apply the amendments beforehand, so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesperson of the Ministry of Justice said the newspaper that it could only be considered worthwhile if legal adjustments were needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already voted for a stock storage in June.

Söder says to the Corona-Lage after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has announced a tea-sive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be seen live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has shattered authorities and politics.
At the large farm, almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working, over a third has been infected with the corona generator.
The court is now under quarantine and is locked down with a building.
No one can leave the site, food is supplied.
The well-favoured 3300 inhabitants of the municipality now offer free corona tests.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Landrats Office has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Knowledge" means the consent of the suspicious burner of Nantes
"My client has shown himself cooperative," said the lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defendant added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "pleaded by consciences and taken very much from the extent of destruction".
In the case of a sentence, the man threatens ten years of imprisonment and a penalty of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutorship.
The Gothic Sankt-Peter-and-Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire was broken out in the church at three far from one another.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of fire foundation.
The now imprisoned suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly reached the view of the investigators.
Discuss about abolishing the 50+1 rules
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended to think about the abolition of the 50+1 rules.
"The German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said Grindel the "Image on Sunday".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work for those associations that can become dangerous at the very best Bayern and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not about whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors of associations that want to break into this Phalanx".
He doubts, however, whether there is a willingness in the German football League to allow majority participations which are prohibited by the 50+1 rule in the Federal League.
"It remains a legal risk to move investment in a European internal market around the Federal Liga economic location," said Grindel.
The former DFB chef sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Federal League only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level but not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even a equal distribution of the TV money will not achieve a decisive effect.
"The FC Bavaria makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three associations alone.
The other 15 associations have an average household of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"There have been people who noticed this error and went through to the press instead of addressing it," said Grindel about the adoption of a expensive clock that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That's been a lot of people to me."
The gift in value of about 11,000 euros he had received from a Ukrainian functionary.
"I have committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"With the ominous watch gift, I have changed completely transparent and arguingly.
Many of them knew about it in the DFB."
He never made "a hole from the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, in any case, this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

She announced that after several years of break 2021, a Rakoczy tournament will also take place again.

Argentina refuses to offer the creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires informed on Saturday.
"This would be not only unresponsible, but also injustice," said an opinion.
"With 50 percent of children living in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer viable under the current conditions.
For this reason, Argentina calls on his private creditors to abandon some of its claims of around 66 billion US dollars (about EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is threatened again.
It would be the ninth failure of payment in Argentine history.
Lastly, creditors had requested higher interest on State bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
However, the Argentine government holds its final offer and is not ready for further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was last more than 50 percent.
Experts expect a decline in economic power by about 10 percent for the year.
At the end of May, Argentina had not compensated interest claims of 503 million US dollars and had thus fallen into a limited deficit of payments.
Professionally arrived - not yet privately
"It runs super good" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after their first days in the notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will join the succession of Lutz fields in the Eggenfelden Notariat station.
Soon six weeks later, early July, the professor took up the work, the normal day business has long been running on full tours.
"However, I still have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottal advertiser and laughs.
Of course, the short precursor period has not managed to move the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the borne Dingolfinger.
Currently she is looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband who is a judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg.
At least, her husband has been able to apply for a short-term parental period in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to pend from Regensburg every day, the 39-year-olds also have a possibility of overnight with their parents in Dingolfing.
Grown up in the neighboring country, the city of Eggenfelden, of course, has long been a term.
When visiting locally with her family over the past few months, she noticed: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
The more she was pleased that she had made the race in the selection process around the free place.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's career development, her homeland of Niederbayern plays a central role: After the Jura study in Passau, she completed her referendum time and the second state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notarassessorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - she also trained the promotion of labour law in this time - in 2012 her first post as a notarin in Rotthalmünster in Passau.
In 2016, she went to the parental age, and finally followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken representative services into various notariats.
When the position had been issued in Eggenfelden because of the nearing retirement of Lutz fields, it had seen the right time for full professional retirement, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representative at the emergency office, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and has liked a praise for the team of the firm's parat: "It's going to be super good!"
The fact that she can rely here on played processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private food point.
In the case of kindergarten-respective crimping places, she has already contacted a local facility.
And if everything works like desired, she hopes to follow her hobby here too soon - and to meet the most beautiful yogging stretches of the red valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"On the basis of the distance control that is compelling, we are planning the "day level" of Carsten Cramer, according to the current stand of 12.000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director.
Usually, the arena in the district city at Bundesliga games catches a little more than 8,000 spectators.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, the BVB per party lost around four million euros.
The Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization, hopes that in addition to the normal viewers, some of the around 4000 places can be opened in the hospitality area: "It is of course a hit into the account when these revenues are completely broken down".
In the face of the ongoing Corona crisis, all of them are currently "advisable to take a stable side long for the first time".
"If many companies are not good and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited," said Cramer.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chief praised the BVB-Profis for its salary participants, which is supposed to contribute to the overcome of the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their loss of salary has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in Merchandising to short work".

One quarter of them weighs less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early born that neither lungs nor intestinal nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothing and specially designed mini-windles for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be with voice - "and like," Berndt URLesberger shunzels.
"Of course they don't shout as loud as big babies."

The film studio Warner Brothers contracted her for seven years and brought her out large on the side of Eroll Flynn.
She turned eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the main role of "To Every His Own".
The film runs in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Erbin).

Kalbitz radius from AfD confirms - FDP speaks of "fig sheet"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the viewpoint of the FDP only a "fig sheet" and does not change anything in the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the legal extreems in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the cyclical radicals in the AfD," said the FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Bundesscheidsgericht der AfD had confirmed the expulsion of Kalbitz, which the Bundesvorstand had decided in May in several hours in Stuttgart.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD really was about to remove legal extremists consistently from their party, functionaries such as Björn Höcke and his adherents would have long been excluded," said Strasser.
"But there is no political will in the AfD because legal extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, doesn't say anything and doesn't change anything," he said "World on Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes, how many frenetic supporters still have a legal extremer in the middle of the AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will land again under five percent in elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the word leaders of the now officially dissolved "flights" around the Thüringer AfD-Landes- und Fraktionsvorsitzende Björn Hücke; the Constitutional Protection is a "protected legal extremist effort".
In May, the AfD board had thrown Kalbitz from the party.
As a reason, Kalbitz did not indicate that when he entered the party, he did not have an earlier membership in the "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
The President of the Left Fraction at the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Bundesscheidsgericht did not change anything in the character of the AfD: "The Wolf has only eaten Kreide.
The AfD remains a legal extreme party, whether with or without calbitz".
This decision does not weaken the Federal Party or the right wings.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen-Trope is transparent.
One wants to escape further observation by the Constitutional Protection and try to get through under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not go away with the spirits she called.
There's no change in a veil," commented Brandenburger SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the Group held their right leader until today."
The legal debate on the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
This announced on Saturday that he would now act against the decision of the Bundesgericht on civil law.
North Sea Wind Parks deliver well 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year 11,51, the wind power plants on the German North Sea sprinkled into the network.
This is about 21 percent more than the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet informed in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transfer of the North Sea stream to the mainland and for the transmission through the German electricity network.
The wind plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the network area of Tennet, have sprinkled in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) electricity.
Overall, the wind flow from the North and the Baltic Sea is at 13.73 TWh, compared to well 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest on sea thus represents almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher production capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is not only due to wind conditions from higher production capacity, because new wind parks have been connected to the network over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea would run all with full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatt electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient, according to Tennet, at 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030 it is supposed to rise to 17 Gigawatt in the German North Sea.
"We invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections in Germany and the Netherlands," said Tennet business leader Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can not exploit their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea Wind Parks produced more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünd Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration at 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold sprinkled the usual framework after the Corona break.

In the north of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was engaged.
Freital: Windberg festival due to Corona
The Windberg festival does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has rejected the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and hoped - in the consciousness of how difficult it is for the parties - until the last minute," said Oberbürgermeister Uwe Rumberg (partless).
"But finally we are here as an organizer responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
For if tens of thousands were flown to the festivals and to the festivals, minimum distances, hygiene rules and contact follow-ups could not be complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not be much left by a folk festival.
In addition, organisational and monitoring costs would increase unproportionally by a variety.
Rumberg dried to the next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence with the winter mountain festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.

More airplanes in Worms
The Wormser University continues to ventilate: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is a professor of "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS was now signed in Worms.
The contract was first completed for three years and started in 2021.
With the professorship, the possibility is to enable the beginning of the study not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This enables twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, both in the university and in the DFS's Aviation Security Academy capacity are equally exposed.
The DFS will advise the university in the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been at the University of Worms in the Air Traffic Management course as part of their training for the aviation locks.
This year, nine students already started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the benefits of students are excellent.
The combination of study and lottery training contributes significantly to increasing the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy for us.
However, we firmly expect flights to recover and grow in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal order in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS in signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation's professor is a future-proof investment, which will transmit a broad, technically comprehensive knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue to cooperate with the university and simultaneously undermine our attractiveness as employers."
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The Foundation Professorship is an important bridge between science and economy.
With her we want to join the existing cooperation with the DFS German Aviation As a practical partner for the dual Bachelor Study Air Traffic Management".
The trust of the German Aviation Security is for the University of Worms motivation and obligation to further develop their learning and research competence in the future areas of aviation.
In the event of tomorrow's flight locks, the universities could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for their students with the first university professor for a dual course.
Dr. Denis Alt, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, stressed: "With its focus on air transport, the University of Worms has an all-defined feature in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue scrubber lands on the A 45
About 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully locked in the Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue scrubber was in use.
A 76-year-old ride with a Ford at 12.40 a.m. at the exit of Alzenau center in the curve and landed at the Leitplanke.

Healing wants to check other sectors after meat industry
The Corona crisis again revealed the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Legislative damages are shortly ahead.
But are they right - and will it stay?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors according to the strict rules now planned against the failures in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry and then take appropriate measures for the industry if necessary," said Heil der Deutschen Presseagentur in Berlin.
Germany's employers have already warned against restricting working contracts in general.
After the massous corona outbreak of the meat giant tonnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to decide a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
Great slaughters should not be allowed to use any other person in slaughtering, destruction and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contracts and loan workers is to be prohibited.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said: "Finger away from a general restriction of contracts and omission of workers, if you do not want to completely disprove the economy."
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for large areas of the crafts, the construction industry and the construction of plants for their value added to the customer.
"The mistakes of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Healing assured: "My goal is not to prohibit working contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are useful.
"If an industrial company is ordering a craftsman to build a security plant, this is a very normal contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and loan work alone in its industry to be inconstitutional.
It should not be explained why in the event of the portion and packaging of cheese, other work law should be applied than in the case of worst, it is said in an opinion on the law project, as the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Samstag) reports.
In the case of a ban, the consumer price would therefore rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Several East European workers from working contract firms worked in the industry after the results of an examination of NRW work protection management partly 16 hours a day.
Often they had no break.
wage was reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Healing said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
But through "tricky constructions" they had been transformed.
"Now needs to be cleaned up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "In the labour protection law, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher levels of labour protection or clear criteria for Community accommodation."
The draft tabled by the dpa includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat sector and the law on protection of workers.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes that more controls are necessary.
"I would like to make more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal protection, all possible, for example also animal transports," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg currently".
However, more controls also require more staff.

Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming gate by Cristiano Ronaldo, Record Champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total 36. Scudetto of the club story with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before the mid-term.
With 83 points, Turin, who arrived without the last-long-breaked ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer pushing two play days before the end of the season of the series A.
The Inter Milan table range is down seven points.
In spite of optical superiority, Juventus was harmless in the first half, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a release variant.
An adventure by Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old directly from the Criminal Area Border with a flat-shoot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved on 2:0 after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67.) was dusted.
This guaranteed the glossy but decisive success.
The foulefmeter shot to the latte in the 89th minute should only have been properly saw by Ronaldo himself with a view to the Torjager value.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically on ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," explained Trainer Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual exhaustion of his players is great, the Juve Coach said.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners couldn't have made the championship perfect yet.
Finally, Juve had to be due to the weakness of the competitors to the calming lead at the tip of the table.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only succeeded five victories.
Whether Ronaldo's also going to be a turkey king, it's questionable.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has reached 31 gates, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already made 34 hits on his account after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) the Lazio Rome table district at Hellas Verona – as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of the FC Bayern.
The record in Italy holds the current Juve Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 gates for the SSC Naples during the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of the Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is in the eighth finale of the Champions League, however, on 7 August against Olympique Lyon has to compete a 0:1 playground to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o.-Runde, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal authors registered
Stuttgart - Allen threatened penalties and judgments in spite of the fact that automobile drivers continue gas in numerous illegal races on the bathing-worted mountain streets: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal authors.
There are no comparative values for the years before, but the Rasers are increasingly working to the judicial authorities: in 2018, a total of 155 investigation procedures were carried out for illegal races, a year later, 252 and 151 were already in the current year until June.
The race was less about organized events, as is shown in the response from the Ministry of Interior to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases the drivers were spontaneously against each other or they would have taken the escape from the police - even that is indicated as illegal races.
The tax was mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 penalties - 15 times imprisonment
Only in a comparatively few cases, the razers are caught and also asked for a checkout: According to the Ministry of Interior, 113 penalties have been imposed since 2018 and 15 sentences of liberty have been imposed.
However, there are no evidence that the number of illegal authors actually increases.
Rather, other drivers responded more sensitive than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more often, said a ministerial speaker.
Especially popular is Rasern's motorway 8. Rasern's driving forces are repeatedly breaching the traffic there to take place and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen rider was caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "rennstrecke"
On the A81, the police even record more races than any other motorway.
With a pace limit, it is attempted to brake the razor on the particularly affected section between tightens and tightens.
The most high-price sports and luxurious cars often have Swiss marks because the drivers for the high penalties for too fast driving and scouting in the neighboring country to race to Germany.
For the SPD, the tempo limit must not be reduced on a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres of hours, we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD country-day fraction.
"The brake threshold for razor would be significantly higher if you shouldn't be legally travelling here and there at 200 kilometres of hours and more."
Rivoir holds less of information or image campaigns: "Who is thus ignoring all the rules and is not only at stake with the lives of others, but also with the lives of other transport operators, is hardly accessible with reason".
ADAC calls for greater police intervention
On the other hand, the ADAC is not enough: "We assume that Raser will not be disturbed from the tempo limits," says Holger Bach, Department Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also harder controls on the routes concerned.
Not rarely, the high-touring force measurements have become more painful and follow-up serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the race throughout the country, two of them in a night crash in Stuttgart's city city and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were supposed to have delivered their authors in November.
One of the vehicles came from the street, sprang against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old rider died.
21 more people have been injured in the race of the past two years.
However, interior minister Thomas Strobl considers that sharper penalties are not necessary: "Requirements of lawmaking to reduce illegal motor races are not seen," says the Interior Ministry Paper.

Illegal tuning tours in Nuremberg: Little part of the scene
The officials counted well 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, bilancing the police.
However, this is only a small part of the presence of the "Autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the scene in question followed the police appeal.
On the basis of the local vehicles and persons, it should be assumed that this was mainly actors.
In addition, the majority of the attendants remained in the current infection protection provisions, in particular the maintenance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nood protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at 1:00 a.m.

"The Police Bureau for Central Freaks continues to keep the event in mind and continues to carry out reinforced control measures, including in connection with the emergence of actors," it said.
The Agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the company involved: "They have all the beautiful rims that we can't shrink," says Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are broader, the company must be careful not to make damages.
"The young people are supposed to keep their cars without prejudice."
Numbers of work agency: 900 suspects of abuse in short work
Berlin - The Federal Labour Agency (BA), according to its own statement, is following about 900 suspects of abuse in the short-worker money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies who have shown short-work," said the director Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When at the beginning of the Corona crisis suddenly many companies had requested short work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually the test lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available in this hot phase.
We will look at the final accounts more precisely.
I'm sure there'll be a few things.
We're not naïve and have a long breath."
Indications on abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, use the BA analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency in autumn.
"Will there be much more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments are varied, but we are wappling for the case and already training our employees in the work agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency money."
The figures are still inconsistent, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in New Garden Solved

Austria: mass tests to Corona outbreak in tourist location
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48 as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still available in the evening.

Overall, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after one year's absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured the third table by a 2:0 (0:0) success against the direct competitors Leicester City.
The Foxes must now join the Europe League because the FC Chelsea was still passing and qualified as the fourth for the king's class as well.
In the fight against the exit, Aston Villa was allowed to rejoice.
Manchester United went to the lead by Bruno Fernandes (71 minutes).
After a red map for Leicester City in the postage, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) met at the end.
Chelsea, in the FC Bayern Champions-League-Achtelfinal Opponent, won with Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) parallel to 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said Trainer Frank Lampard, who in his first season as Chelsea-Coach also stands in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal.
From Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, Tottenham Hotspur also benefited with a magnificent 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace at the Wolves and started as the sixth in the Europe League.
Aston Villa decided the remote douche with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for himself, but had to beat the class maintenance at West Ham United for a long time.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) liked Andrej Jarmolenko (85.) immediately.
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which took three trainers in the season, descends after five first-liga years.
Just like Bournemouth, which could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at the FC Everton.
A point was missing at the end.
The FC Liverpool, which has been established as an English master since the end of June, secured a club record with 3:1 (1:1) at Newcastle United.

"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torschütze van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's getting hard."
At the end, satisfaction is probably also the Prime Minister-League boss.
Due to the Corona virus crisis, the soccer operation in England was interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even a premature breakdown or a postponement of the rest of games was discussed on neutral ground.
Finally, however, the season could be played without special incidents, but as in Germany without viewers in the stages.

North Korea sails border city to Corona suspicion
North Korea has seen a "brightening success" in its own measures to defense the Corona virus.
Now, for the first time, the country reports about a suspicion.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely locked a major city out of fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been brought into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong, the emergency was imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspicion was confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the dissolved country.
North Korea has not previously registered any infection and has described its defense measures as "brightening success".
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of disease have been found in the reports by an outbreaker who illegally crossed the military demarketing line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person went to South Korea three years ago and had now returned over the border.
For the crossing of borders within the four kilometres wide and mostly disminded military buffer zone, there was no confirmation from South Korea at first.
However, according to reports from the National News Agency Yonhap, South Korea's military granted the possibility of an illegal crossing to North Korea.
Investigations were carried out to some people.
According to North Korea, on Saturday on the suspicion of the suspicion, an emergency meeting of the working party's police office was launched under the chair of power officer Kim Jong Un.
The "risk situation in Kaesong could cause a fatal and destructive disaster".
Kim has already appointed a precautionary measure on Friday to "Kaasong completely block and isolate each district and the region of others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had contacted them, were placed under quarantine.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to examine the "excretion" and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, impose severe penalty.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Voltage before Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still facing a great summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental topics, the members of the body will also vote on the construction plan for the main project in the city development east," says it, at 16.30 a.m., in the middle of the urban press release to the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at the Grand Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city is discussed by the end.
The majority of them are scarce, and most recently, in individual committees even rejecting depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed from the citizenship and then from the administration and municipal council not to fail after almost ten years of preparation now, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "extra-parlamentary opposition", "unfortunately", "speculation", "uncompression" and "conscious false statements".
"All think to know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for one year as the only representative of the Citizens' list Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the contracts in this position, he was: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit comes cheaper to the city that the Technical Town Hall is contrary to the statements of the City Administration after grants, whose existence is Little convinced to rehabilitation for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than being predicted in the town hall and by the advocates from the economy.
The city by its own power and not by an investor: that is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides for the rehabilitation of the Technical Town Hall, the openkeeping of the Schlossberg, the rental of the Ex-Tale for Administrative Areas and a smaller suburbal redesign in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a key role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
The municipal council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect Pforzheim's population from health noise caused by road traffic, including many temporary reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the politically responsible people in the city are not innocent of this because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise by neglecting the traffic of the line bus with diluted tacts and by little engagement in cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda for accession to the Baden-Württemberg Climate Protection Pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the urban children's day facilities and the application for entry into the Smart-City funding of the Federal Republic is on the agenda.
Citizens are welcome, but corona protection measures must be applied.
Tim Zimmermann starts with a lot of delay in the new season
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann launches his first season in ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of the supersport cars can take up the regular operation, the first test trips now stood.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from attacking his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was accustomed to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the porsche from the season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really made a lot of fun."
Timmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite its only 25 years of experience in the GT-Sport, the Dutch has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Stein and I understand us fascinating and we have made enormous progress at the Lausitzring also from session to session."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series novels, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the motodrome.
"It worked quickly and I had little to get used to the route," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community of Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitz ring has many fast passages that you need to meet optimally to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann is then really, that's gonna happen in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poker a little in the tests," he says.
"In the end, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitz ring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the appearance of a tight-driven calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races are in progress.
Current status is that no viewers will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, Ex-Formel-1-Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take into the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister of Transport of Quarantine Decision cold caught
According to press reports, the decision of the British Government to put Spain-Urlaubers under quarantine for two weeks after their return has been coldly caught by the State's Minister of Transport.
Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided the measure on Saturday.
Due to the corona numbers that rise in Spain, the cabinet in London stretched the country from the list of countries from which a entry is possible without quarantine conditions.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will have to return to quarantine.
In Austria, the government also imposed quarantine measures on returners.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the day of holiday, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain is still considered to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is the possibility that a quarantine for vacationers is imposed on Spain," said the Labour Deputy Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has made the effort to say Grant Shapp's decision."
Shortly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict starting blocks, the infection numbers in the country rise again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the most popular British holiday countries.
The British Government currently recommends from non-necessary travel to the Spanish mainland, which is particularly popular with British vacationers and Balearic Islands.
More than 272,000 infections with the novel corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.

Governor Greg Abbott called the emergency for many districts.
The Corona pandemic in Texas makes the work of the helpers difficult, said Abbott, according to US media.
Evacuated for caution
"Each Hurrikan is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
With a view to the Wirbelsturm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is still intensified if one remembers that it is fought through an area that is the most affected area of the state of Covid-19".
According to the Johns-Hopkins University, some 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their houses for caution.
They should not disregard practices "who we used to", such as wearing masks, said the governor according to the CBS station.
It's important that all stayed away.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, Corona should be tested in emergency accommodations.
At first, damage had been reported only from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" was hit on the island of Padre Island just before the texan coast on land.
The tropical storm had previously been rising up to the hurricane of the lowest level.
For the coastal section of Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first adopted and later resumed.
Authorities expected a weakening while "Hanna" continues to move into the country's interior and headed to the northeast of Mexico.
Douglas moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurrikan "Douglas" was travelling in the night on Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometres per hour towards Hawaii.
The hurricane center, however, expected that he would continue to weaken himself.
According to the prediction, it should be Sunday (local time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane swell.
This year, after an prediction of May, NOAA expected an over-average active hurricane season over the Atlantic.
From June to the end of November, up to ten orchestras were expected to become up to six very strong wire towers, the Authority had explained.
On average, there are six orchestras per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop to storms of great strength.
In view of the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, which a lower average even at ten percent was said at that time.
US President Donald Trump wrote by Twitter that his government watched the storms closely and contacted the countries concerned.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a relapse for double victory FC Bayern.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think of how he can rebuild his successful defense after the violation of the world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The French, who has been awarded the third-measure service minutes behind Captain Manuel New and Central Field Chief Joshua Kimmich, suffered a band injury at the left root and threatens to lack in decisive king-class duels.
In the Munich Schmuddelwetter, the legal defendant broke off a training game and was driven from the place with a golf card.

"We have just mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and pokal excellently.
Now it is important to create the special," said Flick.
Until the Munich can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve, the eight-eight-eight-eight-eight-eight-eight-fashioned light against the FC Chelsea is the first time.
After the 3:0 in the interplay before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not become the "Finale dahoam" again in 2012.
"We have to go through the door for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and tank trust with a good game," asked Flick.

With a long talk, Flick had sworn his stars, who had a double 13-day holiday, on a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players at the Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Shop Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the square after his change of Manchester City.
"Leroy has inserted himself well like all the new ones," said Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. is not allowed to teach only, Flick would prefer to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of single and small group training, the Londonians are now trained in team strength, in contrast to the Flick ensemble in the game rhythm.
Afterwards, the Munich could face a quarter final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, where Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are potential opponents.

Thus, infections in São Paulo are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams that do not want to drive to Brazil would also not justify a dismissal.

Greta Thunberg: Bad views against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg talked about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in the well-known Letight show by Stephen Colbert via a video switch and explained in the interview what she had in her mind when she met Donald Trump.

She said, among other things, about her fight against the powers of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "blessed look" at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been aware of her intimate use for the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known letight show, she spoke about her plans in the future as well as her encounter with the US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Letight engineer Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg in your mission on Tuesday and led a longer interview with the Swedish.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powers of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to direct the focus from the climate crisis," she shocked.
"All of organized hate campaigns up to threats, just because a group of children goes on the road," she experienced.
Heads of State and leading politicians who spot at them in social media or even try to make them silence find them "good," as you show the reactions "because they have no other answer to it".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she had a bitterly evil look behind the US president Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the Actvistin sailed over the Atlantic, its expressive view was captured by the cameras and has been seen by countless people on the Internet since then.
From the short clip a GIF was created, i.e. an animated image, which was ultimately one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US President at this moment?
On the relatively open question of Stephen Colbert, she just answered undrovely: "To be honest, I believe that no further explanation is needed."
With the tricky answer, the experienced satirician Colbert probably did not expect and disappeared shortly laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" session on the principles of climate protection, she remained in memory at the climate conference.

Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a postway ride: After a rapid rise with Fleetwood Mac it went steep down and then slowly upward.
Now Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug youth, cult adherent: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, and on Saturday, family members informed in an official opinion that another opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton appreciated Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and Gitarrist Green had founded the longest legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamed instrumental hat "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a postway trip.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes without him.
There should have been disputes, among other things, because Green wanted to spend all the profits of the group for beneficial purposes.
He began to appear in large garments and with large crucifix.
Also psychic problems should have played a role.
For three years after the founding, Green left the band 1970.
It followed a social decline.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
Green was treated in the psychiatrie for a long time.
During a large part of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the surface of the image.
He is supposed to live on the street for a while, as cemetery gardener and spent a time in an Israeli Kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish worker family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
In young years he was enthusiastic for US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At 11 years of age, he learned the first guitar attacks.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play professional guitar and five years later the chance of standing on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A few later, he was committed to the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues-Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967, along with his Bluesbreakers-College Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group the first number 1-hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not force the media circulation, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
The life between music and addiction, he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number-1-hit".
At the end of the decade, Green became surprisingly a success of respect with a album inspired by religious subjects.
Fleetwood Mac then swim on a wave of success without him in new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo results, Green did not achieve a larger comeback until he started in 1996 with a group of friendly musicians.
The British "Dayly Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returned to the earth.
Free of drugs Green published some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band resolved in 2004.
For music experts, he has been a blues lie - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists in the past decades.
