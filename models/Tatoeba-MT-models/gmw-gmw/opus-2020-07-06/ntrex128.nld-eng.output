Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that “they will be compared with Muppets”
There is suspicion among the members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that would change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welshe Parliament).
The proposal is a result of the plans to amend the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘is riding on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: Twp is Welsh crazy and pwp is Welsh for poep.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is 'unzufried' and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party is “open” for the change of name, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context the Welshe letter W is expressed as a short you.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, who is currently preparing legislation to implement the name change, said: 'There are, of course, the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the National Assembly of Wales were entitled to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly had to be baptized to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option was most supported in public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have difficulty reaching a consensus, and it must submit a legislative draft on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms also includes other changes in the way in which the National Assembly works, including rules on suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their new title when discussing legislation.
Inhabitants of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, voters voted to change the name of their country in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve an ongoing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim in its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the national debate on the change of names, said that he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, advocates of the referendum, including Premier Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of names is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin silence, those of Harlem have difficulty
“The older people I've spoken said that a café and a church was here earlier on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to detect."
He said it's understandable that cafés disappeared.
"Mensen now have social contact in another way," he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people go regularly.’
However, he is concerned that the earnings of the sale of the assets of the churches will be less long if the leaders expect, "and they will be back at the beginning."
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people would live that will not help in the remaining refugees in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white," he says, "what will lead to the conclusion of these churches even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these apartments will become members of the church community."
Both churches have ever been built by a white church congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white methodists departed in 1930.
A black church congregation from the vicinity took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation under the direction of Honor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from the shopkeepers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where black people could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishes of Eer value Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought an alien.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Honor Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert who played the alien in July referred to the instrument in a different way: ‘an unreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first alien in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger alien of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the church's leak leaders, others by the diocese.
The consistency (the governing body of the parish, consisting of leak leaders) wrote the diocese in July to express her concern that the diocese would “will cover the costs” to the consistency, although the consistency was not involved in the inhuring of the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishes complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Hair wounds 13-year-old who dives to crowns in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the ceremony season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who dived for ceremony in California.
The attack took place just for 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends on Saturday about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others he peddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought the boy called because he had caught a cries, but then he realized “that the boy called,“ I was prayed!
I'm prayed!"
His key leg was completely open,' Hammel saw when he approached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone had to go out of the water, ‘There's a shark in the water!'
The boy was brought with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he said he was in danger of life.
It is not known which kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Beach guard Captain Larry Giles told at a press conference that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that one had then concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured to the upper body.
The authorities closed the access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's will break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competitors with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and set up beauty departments where specialised assistants work, such as in large-scale houses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continue to grow, while the sale of fashion and household articles continues to fall. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they prove to be a success, they will be introduced in more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the racks where TVs, microwaves and interior products were ever available with other products.
Sainsbury's wishes to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brand Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing gamma of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also takes more place, with tableau per brand, such as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up back to the market, since most products are suitable for veganists, some younger shoppers demand more and more.
In addition, parfumerie the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first was opened in Croydon, south of London, the second is opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
Because more and more people are shopping online and buy more and more on a daily basis small amounts of food in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like large-scale houses, now that the supermarket chain takes it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have generated more return.
The last time the supermarket tried to give his departments Beauty and Apotheek a make-over, that became a flop.
At the beginning of the 2000s, Sainsbury tested a cooperation with Boots, but the cooperation was terminated when a conflict was created about the distribution of revenue from the pharmaceutical department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments in the shops three years ago for a amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan by adding an extensive gamma of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: “We changed the establishment of our beauty department completely so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialised training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands we offer for every will, and thanks to the attractive environment and the convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer shopping in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'woeding' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'would' because TV-presentator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle business. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is once compared with the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presentation of This Morning announced on Instagram that she leaves.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is raging at Holly Willoughby because she has recently withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “would” when Willoughby said that during a difficult meeting in Marlow's main establishment, Buckinghamshire, Willoughby announced that she did not keep enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories through its new contracts (with a value of up to one and a half million pounds).
The company is once compared with the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of an estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced that she would leave Truly, Jones left to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: “Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would guarantee its future in the long term and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was astonished when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The property of the main investment in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrice, one of the most profitable stars in Great Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of large investments in products from kisses and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launching could now result in further delays.
And that could mean the end of a years of friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two couples often go together on holidays and Jones shares 40% in the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby will soon become Markambassadeur of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter of the program I'm A Celebrity on the British channel ITV.
A source from the entourage of Jones said last night: “We have no comment on his business affairs.”
Hard language 'and then it was love between us'
He cried about the criticism he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find "inappropriate for a president" and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I didn't give up anything."
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June a great step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have begun.
More than three months after the Summit in Singapore in June, the top expert Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a 'according' reaction by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues with its sanctions to keep the pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We do it very well in North Korea," he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results. The missile tests have been terminated, assembled, and the material surpluses of U.S. military forces have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach as to his relationship with Kim.
“It's as easy to conduct you as a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, there would be about 200 people,” said Trump while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island with hundreds of deaths
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign ngos were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had no more housing, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for launching international aid.
‘In many cases, it is unfortunately clear that they do not request any international aid, which is difficult for us,’ said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure whether the helpers from abroad can work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the Agency for auxiliary assistance in national disasters, said that Indonesian officials were still considering the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly badly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide at tsunamis, but along other coasts you can rarely see them.
That there was no warning syringe for tsunamis in Palu, even though a warning was in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal circumstances, it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reached the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's portless infrastructure was one of the core points of the election campaign of President Joko Widodo, and he has already spent abundant money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko has to face a shortage of funding, and that, while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands had to leave their home because of the fighting of Christian and Islamic gangs on the street, with machetes, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge van Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge guarded Liverpool last Saturday for loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from the purpose of Chelsea, at the time his team stood behind with 1-0.
He ticked left against the ball and then scoped in the direction of the farest stake.
The ball flew high above the penalty, towards the right corner of the net.
He evaded the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edge approaching and daring an attempt. I didn't really think about it, I just shook on the ball."
Chelsea stood at the rest with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues peaked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, and then he speeded through the middle field to Liverpool's playlight.
Kovacic did a quick one-two in the middle field.
Then he gave a beautiful stitch pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penitentiary.
Hazard was faster than the defense and scoped the ball with his left foot by Alisson Becker van Liverpool in the net, next to the back stake.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 15 p.m. in the group phase of the Champions League against Napoli, at the stadium of San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes it on Thursday at 15 p.m. in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europe League.
Tsunami death in Indonesia is up to 832
The death number of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen up to 832, said the Agency for Assistance in National Disasters Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruin of buildings that had been collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 of the previous Friday, with waves of 6 m high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrests 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder after woman has been killed
This morning a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews in John Street at 7.55 hours. The body was injured. A 32-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police ask the local residents to report if they have seen or heard something.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The research has just just been started, but I want to contact everyone who was close to John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen something suspicious or heard requests to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially to taxpayers, to contact them if they might have filmed something through a dashcam. After all, they can have information that is essential for our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman at the place to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation runs and the police confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but got to hear from the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
The inhabitants are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She's still repeating, "What bad!"
At 14 a.m., two police cars were inside the deposit and a third was just outside.
Within the deposit, a number of agents kept watching the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call for 101 or to contact Crime stopers on the number 0800 555 111, with the entry of log 247 of 30 September.
Statue of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-rel
The exile of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr. Crick as "dwaas" and "a attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the visibility of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses or Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies of the opinion that reigned in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many, still needs recognition.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course monarchy.
Or that is a completely correct presentation, it is still debated.
What is sure is that the conflict has formed the further development of our nation in the mid-17th century, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gulf.
His achievements such as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered.'
Sudden pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in the southwest of China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the last name 'Yuan' is known, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province. His artery was drilled and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the intake of pigs in a pig pole on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He was said to have travelled from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market with his cousin.
The next morning his nephew found him dead and proved to be opening a door to a neighboring pig pole.
According to the cousin, a large male swine with blood was on his mouth in the swine cage.
A forensic study showed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"The legs of my cousin were bleeded and mutilated," said the cousin named 'Wu', according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras, Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan or his cousin.
A market responsible man told the Evening News that the pig had been locked in order to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence on site.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are said to negotiate a compensation for his death.
It happens rarely, but there have already been cases of pigs that attack people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, making the man seriously wounded.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife hung the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News witnessed that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can lure out aggression.
“They're just playing.
They're just kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,' he said.
The tail of the Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the USA
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening since she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a hurricane of category 1 at 5 hours on Sunday morning and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's gonna go up to the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trog begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, moving east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the USA.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that responds with the approaching trog will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, ruins and potential earth shifts in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to depression of 5 to 8 cm a hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
There are up to 5 to 10 cm rain expected in parts of the southwest, especially above the majority of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, because the tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly recommended to enter the desert at foot when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can convert ravines into desert rivers, and storms will produce local windflesh and dust.
The approaching trog brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small ruin flows and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening to Monday morning, after which the rain is spread more Monday at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October the temperature in the USA can be strongly dim, because the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropics remain quite hot.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the middle and east of the U.S., October was expected to start warm, with temperatures all around the 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it can be 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the probability to mid-October is great at over-measured temperatures in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people looked on Thursday on one of the six television networks for the provocative testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault that was said to take place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for the surprise of Friday: an agreement regulated by Jeff Flake, senator of Arizona, to examine the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee for Justice that it is 100% sure that a drunken Kavanaugh was cheating her and tried to pull her clothes out at a high school festival.
Kavanaugh explained in an professed testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have probably looked on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No figures were available immediately for the other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at an office.
For comparison: that is about like a play-off of a football game or for the Oscar edition.
Fox News Channel, which gives the appointment of Kavanaugh all the support, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.2 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS registered on Friday morning that demonstrators cried to him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Court of Justice.
He stayed a few minutes with downhill eyes while he was shamed, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone cried, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels were all live when the judicial committee had to vote for the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate for hours later.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the fact that the FBI would examine the accusations against the nominated by the next week, something the Democrats of the minority insist.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, senator and Democrat.
Flake took his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened a FBI investigation on the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of a 'political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of a 'political game' with the future of Great Britain and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives for the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson emphasized his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit. He said that her proposal that Great Britain and the EU had to collect each other's charges was absurd.
Schiet Party Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the player of LSU
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketballer at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and was in prison for suspicion of death, said Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses in the crime scene and found the DNA of Simpson on the glasses, WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His guarantee is set at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The body viewer of the municipality in East Baton Rouge has published a provisional report on Friday that states that the cause of death is a shock wound in the neck.
The report notes that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Labor, the Southern University police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation that led to a arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva van LSU thanked the local police for his "intention and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU Basketballcoach Will Wade said that the team 'capot' and 'in shock' is dead by Waydes.
"This is an event that you always hope it will never happen," says Wade.
Vulcan sprays as in Mexico City
The axis sprayed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Rampenprevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was picked up in the crater and 183 gas and axis emissions were registered in a 24 hour period.
The center detected several times junk and vibrations.
On social media, pictures of a thin layer of axis appeared on autoruits in districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geofysici have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital. That is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake struck with a force of 7.1 on the scale of Judge central Mexico.
The volcano, called 'Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Police conflicts with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists succeeded in the riot police, while thousands of participations in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia which dispersed the region in two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the riot police coupled the agents with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in the streets usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, screenshots broke out with the police, and the cops picked up their knobs to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Don’t forget, not forgive, while their opponents called ‘Long livee Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for light injuries that they suffered during the protests, the local press reported.
The tensions remain high in the independent region, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The constituents spoke overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who are against separation boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year almost 1,000 people were injured after the police had tried to stop the vote in the voice offices in the region, with violent screenings.
Pro-independence groups had camped the night of Friday on Saturday on the spot to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician living with his wife in the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
“ Last year we have experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties gained an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though that nipt was difficult for them this year to build on their success, many of their most well-known leaders are, either in exile or in captivity, in the wake of a legal case about their role in organizing the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old assembler who filmed the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been raised by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are increasingly higher," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in preservation since the end of last year, declared that he will participate in the European Parliament's elections next year.
"A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the deterioration of democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after home wasramed with a car
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was repeatedly ramped in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday at 19.30 a.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves had damaged.
Perhaps at a given moment a crossbow on the car has been fired.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to the goal of Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and worried Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and the team of Gary Holt came to be at the same level as Hibernian.
Gerrard's team did not succeed this season in winning an event during the Premiership. They must record the Sunday against leader Hearts, who stands for eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers Rapid Vienna receives Thursday in the Europe League.
In the meantime, Livingston is still dismissed. The team has won six races after each other in his department, and trainer Holt hasn't left any defeat since he left Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for strong visitors
The team of Holt could have realized a lead for the first goal long before. After all, their direct way of playing provided all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but did not succeed in finishing it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up the headball of Craig Halkett, took the ball above the target.
The home team made the Rangers play with a lot of fun, waiting for his chances quietly and self-sureed.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scattered from the penitentiary area.
At that time, the Rangers had been baling for a long time, but the defense of the home team was inevitable and the target Liam Kelly had not had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had to prevent a goal.
Scott Pittman scoped the ball against the feet of Rangers-Teleman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a proposal from his colleagues of Livingston.
Continuingly, Livingston's penalty area was launched, but they were worn every time. Two times a penalty shot was refused, one after Halkett's attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' of Livingston - analysis
Apartment Lamont from BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellently and continue to exceed the expectations in their race to the top.
Their playstyle and the composition of their team have been almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has swept up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Chairman Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their tens throughout the race.
However, the Rangers did not know by breaking.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase wasn't good enough (they succeeded only once to scalp the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the class.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together Saturday (29 September) breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims at restoring relations between NATO alliances.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of press and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan left to Cologne before opening a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called on security reasons when they stopped the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathisans came around to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurden, also let their voices hear, and they condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor who is praised by some German Turkish as a hero and is accused of as autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident happened near the crossing point of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10.15 p.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago another cyclist died in an accident with flight crime on Childers Street, about half a mile from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that cops were going to identify the man and his closest family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are redirected and automotives are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six captains wounded in order distortion
Six caps have been injured by a distortion of order in a severely secured prison for men, according to the prison office.
The unfortunate breaks Sunday at about 9.30 p.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still in progress.
Specialized “Tornado” caps have been employed to resolve situations involving eight in one section.
The cupiers were treated place for light injuries in the face.
A spokesman of the Prison said: “There has been specially trained prisoners for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and the responsible people are, at least, transferred to the police and may have to remain longer behind the tralies.'
In HMP Long Lartin, more than 500 are in prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals of the country.
In June, it was noted that the director of prison was treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police was called to prison for a serious distortion of orders in which staff were attacked with biljart balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with potentially positive effects on drought areas)
It rarely happens that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, because the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa moves over the southwest of the desert area, which brings risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already given warnings for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang on Tuesday right above Phoenix. Monday night it's gonna rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix observed in a second that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of depression, with isolated quantities up to 15 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Beaks, will probably get 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas that do not risk flooding, the rains of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is very worrying, some of this rainfall is likely to be favorable, because the southwest is currently going through a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are indicated, slightly more than 40% of Arizona spends at least extreme drought, the second-class weather.com reported.
The hurricane of Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, making it weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive Monday in the afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
Strong rain can fall into parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
‘Nearburst of a total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa moves north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona in the early morning hours as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and south of Utah on Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger expected by Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life - threatening sudden floods and ruins in the deserts and earth shifts in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempt to murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempt to murder after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset.
The teen was found at about 4 hours of local time in the district of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to the police of Avon and Somerset.
The police ask everyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh's suffered under the commonness, the rage of the Democratic Party
'A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and shameful tactic of the Democratic Party', said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointing procedure Kavanaugh has been constantly 'lasting under the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and denied strong and emotional the temptation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her intention during the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said that the “American people saw the beautiful and unbelievable character, the quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice with which one of the most completed legal opinions of our time is recognized, a lawyer with an excellent state of service," he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
“In five weeks one of the most important elections in our lives takes place.
I don't take part, but actually I'll take part,' he said.
“That's why I'm everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump said that the Democrats are on a mission to "provide resistance and hinder us".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, a top collaborator from the GOP management told CNN.
Hundreds kill by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is increasing
At a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, where many were wiped away from the ground when gigantic waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people met on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters high land at the time it began to scheme. Many people dumped and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
"When the tsunami threat started yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian agency for help in natural disasters BNPB during a letter in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree stems, houses, he hit everything on the land,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people went into a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On air photographs released by the natural disaster assistance agency, many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been twisted and collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city remained burial by naschocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released in the massive earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the force of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima during World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, has still increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “acceptable” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were dumped.
Some deadly victims were trapped under the ruin of broken buildings, he said, about 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala "lights completely flat, we don't have any information at all," said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on the way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,’ said the Red Cross.
The organization received much criticism on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images divided on social media, it is heard how a man on the upper floor of a building in panic screams to people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are swept along.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami ensured a large current tower that cut off the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army currently sends freight aircraft with aid goods from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacues still need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is reopened only for assistance and remains closed for the public until October.
President Joko Wido will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Dodentol of tsunami rises above 800.
It's very bad.
True, the employees of World Vision from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees in the interior of their office are looking for accommodation in tents of deckzeil, but passing on the way scenes of destruction, said Doseba.
"They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began with the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and staff from abroad can only be authorised if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a catastrophe at province level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
'As soon as the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.'
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami fell on Friday on Palu, friends and family of the missing people kept hoping that they would find their loved ones life, such as in the miracles that people liked to hear of terrible natural disasters as these.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewage.
On Sunday, helpers freed a woman who had stuck two days under the ruin with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had occurred earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had crashed had spread into the paragliding community and that he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages in the hours afterwards to the sportsmen in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, his reports appeared only one gray vinkje instead of two blue pinks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26.750 while supplying money machine in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole 26.750 dollars from a co-worker of Brink who was filling a money machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver had just leaned a money machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill him with money, so inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man walked behind the coworker of Brink and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects flights, according to the press report, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the offenders is asked to contact Newport's police on the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words “The being that is formally known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the start of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for 'emotional reasons', says the maker of the show.
Ye is not only a shortage of his current artist name. Earlier West told all that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you', said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album with radiopresentator Big Boy.
“So I'm you, I'm us, we're it.
I have been surpassed from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who's changing his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love this year.
JAY-Z, who used to cooperate with West, has already worked with and without the connecting sign and the capital letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, promised never to use military power against citizens. The country stands on the front of the 50th anniversary of a bloody represaille against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday on Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired a peaceful demonstration on the square, with up to 300 people killed. Left student movements came up in whole Latin America during that period.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
United States should double funding of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements on A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030 the country wants to be number 1 in the area of A.I. innovations.
'The budget for research to A.I. would already be a good start, given the fact that all the other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.' said Lee.
A doublement of funding can lead to a doublement of the likelihood that the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in Face++, one of the most important A.I. companies in China.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University at an A.I. system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later he was manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology contests organized by the American government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next game would take place, as it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to obtain public subsidies, Lee said.
"China doesn't pick up our best academics, the companies do that," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have acquired the best forces of universities in recent years to work on A.I.
Lee said that the U.S. efforts in A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“He who doctorates on the A.I. level should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other public organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve partners from industry and academic world in the initiative, and announced the White House the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Committee of Artificial Intelligence).
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million in A.I research.
However, the U.S. legislation that should lead to the establishment of a National Safety Committee for Artificial Intelligence has been in the process for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change in their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in the name of their country in ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’, which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been attacked for decades and would no longer impede the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, saying that the name of its northern neighbour is that the country claims in Greek territory. Thus Greece put its veto against the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded in June an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of names would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycot campaign would not be sure that the required rise of at least 50% will be achieved, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the voting table was formulated as follows: ‘Are you in favour of NATO and the EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Assistants of the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, find that the price to be paid is worthwhile to try to become a member of such bodies as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that have arisen when the former Yugoslavia ran out.
"I am voting today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union's paraplu, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us, said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The change in the name would require a second-liferity in Parliament.
The National Election Committee said that no reports of irregularities had been reported at 13 a.m.
However, the rise was only 16 percent at that time, compared with 34 percent during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters came to vote.
“I am coming to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Stramica, Macedonia, during the referendum around the country's name change that would open the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov established a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back gate, Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will provide necessary investments for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I am convinced that the vast majority are in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev, following the issue of his voice.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Studies showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
Another peiling, performed by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, was concluded that 57% of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of that, 70% would vote yes.
If the referendum is successful, the rise must be 50% plus one voice.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow for the pro-wester government's policy since this last May.
Look at: Sergio Aguero van Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scoorte
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short metres with the defense of Brighton in the Etihad stadium in Manchester. Manchester City won the race with 2-0.
It seemed like a fleet of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peak was first played the ball on the centre.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, right into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew to pass a defender and was too fast for some others at the edge of Brighton's penalty.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the police station to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat the target man Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said Coach Pep Guardiola from Manchester City to the press.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he made a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in the playground of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful slope along the left-flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane kept the ball with him and then sent Sterling to the second stake.
The Sky Blues player ticked the ball the net, just before he was too far.
City takes the Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The race takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and make it not easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there wasn't much reason to force a new start.
Yet, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are any consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the play-off. They are currently one match for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least received a wildcard for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to work to ensure their first section title.
“Although there is nothing for us, at least we can pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this public and the other team probably plays at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why don't I want to play in that?'
The Nationals must still announce who will be moving on Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to set up Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was going to start his 34th, stood on Thursday and still would pitch next Sunday, although that is normal his rest day.
The right-handed thrower of Washington stands on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220,2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, and spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
“All that we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks one of the most important elections in our lives takes place.
This is one of the really big elections, and I don't take part, but actually I'll take part, and that's why I'm everywhere for great candidates,' he said.
Trump continued: “We see a terrible, horrible group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they are determined to take the power back, regardless of what they have to do for it. You see the commonness, the anxiety.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "provide resistance and impede us."
'And we have seen that in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'boos and common and false and lying'.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who puts it in the Senate Committee for Justice, which led to a loud appeal from the public.
"Do you know what she answered?
Have you selected the document?
Eh, eh, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a wide church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censure me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who have not been welcomed, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censure because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues as these which Jeremy did not agree with earlier leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday stated: ‘We want the meetings to be included and productive.’
And that was the same during most GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I am already a local Labour Member.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and has long forgotten the promise of a "skiller, softer" politics if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable for the party management or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy's leadership, and I expected to take a position where I would never have agreed, from subjects like national security to the European unit market.
Every time I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are disgusting parties on social media calling for a rejection of my candidateship as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, which exposes the policy of the centre and is said to me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments on my address are generally political.
I am impressed with the professionality and determination of those colleagues who have to deal with a flood of sexual or racist reactions every day, but do not let themselves intimidate.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that there is apparently a normal view of terrorism.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer wide church and with every “motion of distrust” or change of selection rules the party becomes more small spirit.
For the last two years, I have often been given the advice to keep myself defeated, not just to express my opinion, and then I would “not get into trouble.”
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I became a member of Labour as a school child 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the Government of Thatcher, which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always asked for better public services for those they most need, both in my role and in my role as minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, nor at the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy points and my controversy with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves forward to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy to my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidate for the next elections or to prevent political opportunities from acting according to what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Uncovered Ayr on the way to the top
Two late trials may have pulled the end result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr triumphs rightly in this delicious match of the day in the Tennt's Premiership.
They're upstairs in the classroom now, the only unnoticed team of the ten.
Finally, they were both their superior defense and their better chances that the home team gave the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We have already had difficulty in our competitions and we are still dismissed, so I am a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: “All honor to Ayr, they have better utilized their opportunities than we are.”
Grant Andersons try in the 14th minute, finished by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes from the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors race), Melrose was able to speak the figures and Jason Baggot succeeded in breaking a try.
With a penalty for an additional advantage for Ayr, Climo scoorde a conversion after a solotry just for the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well, and the trial of Patrick Anderson, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the jump to five points.
The game was quiet for a long time for a serious blessure of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried off on a brancard, and as soon as the race was rebooted, Ayr could continue to run through a trial of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then the leader Blair Macpherson received a yellow card from Ayr, and again Melrose computed with the extra man when no conversion followed a Bruce Colvine try at the end of a race where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tricked Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of the rising Ayr-mill for a touch-down to the penalty-line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did that almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe took up the box kick of David Armstrong and sent back Gregor Henry away for the fifth attempt from the home team.
Ster van Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran from Still Game in the horeca. He seems to be appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the ‘blooding restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is of us': the Bolivian country-included hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sealui patrol in a sainted marine office in La Paz.
On public buildings a ocean blue flag wappers.
On all the marine basins from the Titicaca Lake to the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is of us.
It's a duty to win them back."
In all the country around Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country has had to leave after a bloody nineteenth-century commodity conflict with Chile is still alive, just like the desire to re-experience the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its highest point in the last decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a decision by the International Court of Justice, which should be consulted on 1 October after five years.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, looks forward to the result with positive prospects," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will consider the judgment of the Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will in the benefit of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of pitty talks, is obliged to grant Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who next year stands for a controversial struggle for re-election, is also at stake with the ruling of Monday.
“We are very close to the return to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in the benefit of Bolivia, and even if that was the case, there would be little change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final proceedings, indicates that the case was ‘not complex’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, in the last four years the situation may have become even worse.
"The case around access to the sea has been purchased by the current Bolivian government," said Zárate.
The war-scientific retoriek of Morales has all the good will that Chile may have been completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue with their conversations at a certain time, but it will be extremely difficult to talk afterwards.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in the country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the decision of the court has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile, and an opportunity to ‘enter 139 years of disagreement, with mutual advantages’, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, is using the maritime issue as a political crack.
‘Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
'The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.'
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that state secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to re-established nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un van Noord-Korea.
Ri says it is a 'utopie' that the lasting sanctions and the U.S. objection against a statement that ends the Korean war will ever get North Korea on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without that Pyongyang first takes important steps in the field of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism, and it is doubtful that Pyongyang is serious if he says that he would absent from an arsenal that the country probably sees as his only way to guarantee his security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge main covers, soon for sale with you in the vicinity
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not look further.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hats were not to think of Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their eye-blinding creations to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a featherous wide edge, which hanged up to the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were water melons occupied with precious stones, a magic hat and even an ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were sealed. They seemed more to Hannibal Lecter than to haute couture.
One creation seemed like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this dared mode, you're lucky.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The gigantic hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two meters wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very unpractical hat that popped up on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in bathing suitcase that the suitcase was sucking.
The red orange rafia bag, placed with rafia francs and finished with a white leather hungsel, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other initiatives in the whole community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desired subjects in high schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, you reach his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can not only trust in English when we want to build relationships and a trust band with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can conclude that languages are on the top of the list, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages had a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools associated with SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students obtained a high score (‘A’) in Mandarine, while 72 percent of students received German, 69 percent of students French and 63 percent of students Spanish as well.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as a choice of as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A research carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Vacation in 2014 showed that the obstacles to filling vacancies were attributed 17 percent to a lack of language knowledge, according to employers.
So language skills are increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now that more and more vacant language knowledge requires, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he has a real benefit in the future with such skill for life.
Directly communicating with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person a priority to competition.
According to a YouGov level among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to talk. French was the only language that exceeded 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investment in language education is now important for today's children.
More languages can speak, in particular those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are working to provide a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You might be fair.

LeBron makes his debut on Sunday with the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James's first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, it's almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the opening race before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
There is still to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one, and less than 48,” said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a second that James probably will play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six races before the season.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need any competitions before the season to prepare me," he said.
Period of electoral rallys of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of elections rally's
It's the first of five planned rally's of Trump in the next week, including stops in places that love him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate whom he prefers for the office in the Supreme Court has been set aside, Trump wants to build up support for the upcoming interim elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voted in November.
How late does Trump Rally begin in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 p.m.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings for candidate-president Brett Kavanaugh this week, which were extra charged since Kavanaugh was accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait for a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI examines the case.
But the main objective of this series of rally is to help the Republicans who are candidate for the elections in November to get more elan.
The campaign leader of President Trump said that these five rallys are intended to “promote volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Delegates”, says Reuters.
‘Control on the Congress is so important for its programme that the president travels to as many states as possible now that the busy campaign season begins’, said a spokesman of the Trump campaign that did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
The rally tonight in the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday, the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrise, who remains in the peasants.
"It is not a good sign for Morrise that the president should come to give him an anger in the peasants," said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the start of Sunday singles
After three unilateral sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The moulding slinger of chances is a completely recognized sports concept, but one of which players really believe in, and especially in competities like this.
So who's currently getting the best chances?
"They had a lead of six points first, and now that is only four more, so we find such a little that happiness is currently on our side," said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage that they have four points ahead, while twelve are still in the game.
The Americans, as Spiet said, find that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spiet and Justin Thomas, who played together the whole day and killed each three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearless opposer from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds that he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial well with which four became a success when he and Thomas stood two points behind after two matches.
His well with which she won the game on 15, was followed by a similar shout, the kind you can derive from that he believes that the American team has not yet been reported.
“You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game” said Spiot.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spiet and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the inconsistent story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but delicious European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that did not play a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning, they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their rude audience, they are the players to be reported on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will ever be the most popular player who books a European victory when the sun goes under Le Golf National.
If preferably both at different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short meters with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a reverse for the Spaniard and the Swedish who didn't get over them anymore.
On Sunday, however, nobody can help you get your backshot.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duo's, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in an eye.
The European team has so far played the best and has a great advantage in the beginning of the last day, but this foursome session has also demonstrated that Team USA is willing to tackle the fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubt.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a beautiful jump on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they stand on the United States with 10-6.
The beloved duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had it hard, making them have four points ahead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to lose the trofee she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blasting Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two races, but couldn't get his back.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points during the 12 singles races of Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who wins four points in line, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname 'Molliwood', after a sensational weekend are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening races.
After playing Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they were beautifully playing together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who slept through two races on Saturday, occasionally showed a wonderful move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of ‘in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
However, it wasn't a league for Europe on this pleasant day with a brieze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas put the norm for the Americans with three points on Saturday.
They won after a difficult race with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later lost Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to take a backdrop of four points at the beginning of the singles, although the Fureich team has enough of equality, as they currently have the trofee in hand.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack seems too high on Sunday.
North Korea says that it will ‘not in any case’ unilaterally disarm without confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions lead to increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could in no case give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken important goodwill measures last year, such as stopping nuclear and rocket tests, dismantling the location for nuclear tests and the promise of distributing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see a similar response from the US," he said.
'Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will never unilaterally disarm ourselves.'
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints on the resistance of Washington against a “fiscalized” approach to denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded as the further steps were taken, he noted that the unilateral denuclearization was a priori, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work to the 'deuclearization of the Korean peninsula', while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea aims to end the Korea war in 1950-53, but the United States have said that Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to simplify the hard international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US urges "deuclearization first" and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a forced way and even by objection to the "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is an air castle of the people who are unknowledging about us.
But the problem is that the continual sanctions only strengthen our distrust.'
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the U.S. leader did in the United Nations before the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: ‘If the other party was in this issue of denuclearization South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.’
However, the show of Ri's speech was considerably different from last year when he said the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the American continent were directed after Mr Evil President Trump Kim called a 'raketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea completely, praised Kim this year with the United Nations to take his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that there is still much to happen and that sanctions must remain until North Korea denuclearises.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: ‘The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must be continued strongly and certainly until we have achieved the complete, definitive, verified denuclearization.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unanimous sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not good.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea claimed him to set 'going-star demands'.
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take 'compatible measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'compatible measures' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard follow course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sleeping Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist connected to the Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. As far as he knows, this is unique in the USA.
He got the idea of starting the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleeping lack of learning.
"At the end of my talk, a girl came to me who said, "Why do I have to hear this now, in my last year?"
She said no one ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is being organized this year for the first time, explains the basic principles of how good sleeping habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, decided to organize the course when it was established that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see an image of a sleeping room, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise devices and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sport performance is influenced by sleeping shortages, and the importance of routine in sleeping.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep shortage increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Using a flat ground of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change the conduct of the students.
But we think they have the right to know all this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of cigarette choice on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of fieryness on a night's study still exists, he says, and through modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep shortage is an increasing problem.
Caring for sufficient sleep, of good quality, must be the student's “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight increase, because sleep shortages ensure that the brain gives them constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course. He had been studying at the professor last year at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to ensure that the course was available to everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a comparable study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, not only a alarm to stand up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can irregularize your circadian rhythm, which allows you to have trouble falling into sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Menga is going down the men of Gerrard
The Rangers saw their race again disappointing when Dolly Menga scoorde and Steven Gerrard's weak team slept with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during a race since they slew St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but the team of Gary Holt took care of the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 races. His team now stands eight points behind Hearts, which went further out at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get more problems, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown to him by the supporters of the visitor team.
Gerrard carried eight changes in his team. They stopped by Ayr and went to the half finales of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same eleven number for Livingston, who knew the Hearts last week to cut off a point. He would have been excited about how his well-trained team knew to block the opponents at every move.
The Rangers may have had most ballbeat, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga gave off the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the vizier, but the midfielder could not finish it.
A deep free staircase from Keaghan Jacobs reached commander Craig Halkett, but his colleague defensor Alan Lithgow shot against the back stake.
The Rangers managed to take over the control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than that they really believed when they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found that he was entitled to a penalty shot when he and Steven Lawless broke after a quarter, but divorcer Steven Thomson woven away from the Colombian request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot the goal twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was formerly targeted at the Ibrox, was able to stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and the tamme shot of Ovie Ejaria with ease.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in the prolongation of the general game, no one can deny that they deserve this, even if it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers weren't upset against the deep game pattern of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained coolbloody and chose Menga, who took the ball easy to trap in the target.
Gerrard managed to interrupt the change of Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a game of the kind Livingston's favorite game, where Lithgow and Halkett continue to stake long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last stage of the race, but McGregor kept good and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invaller Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a penalty after an adventure with Jacobs at the end of the race, but Thomson looked up the other side again.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the almanak of our Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, today just 136 years ago, for whom can be good TELLE... the day when future physicist John Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device named geiger counter.
The aggregator has not since been thinking out of science, and also became an icoon in the pop culture, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a film from 1950 with the first sight unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: 'What is that for God's sake?'
Rogers: “That is a pierteler, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.

New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malicious cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and kill malicious cells
Vaccin teaches immune system to recognise malicious cells in treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change it into a labo
They can then “see” a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and then be re-injected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise malicious cells saw her ovary cancer disappearing over 18 months
The method removes immune cells from a patient, after which the cells in the labo are adjusted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which often occurs in various types of cancer, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “simulates the growth of different types of cancer” including breast cancer, ovary cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and to teach these cells to tackle cancer cells proved to work in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West departs pro-Trump tirade and wears MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That wasn't walking like he had hoped.
Kanye West was released during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an inseparable act in which he prizes the U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he becomes presidential Scandinate in 2020.
After bringing his third number of the evening, Ghost Town, with a pet on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he stopped a tyre against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“If I speak to a white man, it asks, ‘How can you now have sympathy for Trump? He is a racist!'
If I was worried about racism, I had been leaving America for a long time," he said.
The release of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stopped the dragon with the witness from Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee for Justice in connection with the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford accused him.
The tyre of West was not sent out, but comic Chris Rock uploaded them to social media.
It's not clear whether Rock wants to steep the dragon with his post with West.
West also complained against the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his pet.
“They have trembled me backstage.
They said, "Don't get on the stage with that pet."
They harassed me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see how apathetic it look?” He said that he would attract them superman cape, “for that means that you can’t command me. Do you want the world to be better?
Give some love.'
From the public, at least two times called out and the castles of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard by an attendant: “The entire studio was suddenly silent.”
West was too guest as a last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the number I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweet: ‘To one of our most courageous spirits: BEDANKT YOUR MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talkshow-presentatrice Karen Hunter tweette that West was just "normally himself, and that is beautiful."
“But I choose not to reward anyone who is harmful to my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “art”).
He's free to do what he wants.
We, too, added them.
Before the show started, the rapper on Twitter had announced that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, "the being that is formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist who changes his name, and he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega-rapper Snoop Dogg also wore the name Snoop Lion and the deceased music legendary Prince ever changed his name to a symbol and then in The artist previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington gets out to toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role of sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor takes out to the stereotype of the machoheld and says that young boys often think they need to be tough to get respect when they see such roles on the screen.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that “there was something wrong” and asked himself how to address the problem of toxic maleness in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married with his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem must be addressed.
"This is really an important question for me at the moment: where did it go wrong with our maleness?" he said.
"What did we learn men when they grew up, so we're faced with this problem now?"
Kit thinks that television could be partially responsible for the increase in toxic maleity, due to its very male characters.
He continued: ‘What is born and what has been taught?’
What is taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
Because there was obviously something wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games or Thrones when the series ended next summer, because he is “clear with battlefields and horses”.
From November on, Kit plays in a revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he finds his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I've met my wife during the series, so in this way I've kept my future family and my life over from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits personage Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple was married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslies family in Scotland.
Hiv/aids: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese has increased by 14% by HIV and AIDS.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed through sex, which was not previously.
Hiv has quickly spread in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who are in this way hiv is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared with the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100.000 people.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no longer punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
According to studies, the conservative values of the country estimated that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
The diseases are often transmitted by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that staff worker has selected data from Republican senators and extracts them to 'angerable lies' and 'complot theories'
The U.S. Congress member Maxine Waters objects to the accusations that one of her staff employees has placed the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claims that the accusations are distributed by 'extreem-right' disputers and websites.
"Laughter, lying, and more unpleasant lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and the private phone number of the American senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill at a hearing of the Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate-juster for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained it the information of a Waters staff, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no case responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a flagrant lie."
Waters' statement has already quickly hit criticism online, including by former press competitor of the White House Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds angry,” wrote Fleischer.
“This is why you can reveal that she does not have the temperament to be a Congress member.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He shouldn't ask the prosecutor's motives.
He must stay calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of exaggerated anger during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"High, if it's true," he twisted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
"We will make the offenders known," she said, "and they will be legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff workers."
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British intake, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that is indeed true of this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a slipped spion in the main role, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was created back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this awful evenatire about how bad we do it the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with scratching eyes and flexible facial attractions succeeds at least to send everything in the hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name you can already conclude that he is a common comic character that was designed for bioscoopgangers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little clouseau, a bat of Mr. Bean and a grind of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man Atkinson ever played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor equipment and the rotor blades to tick his helmet.
In this film, Atkinson can well show how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough, especially now the "serious" film series such as 007 and Mission Impossible self-comedie includes as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than for adults, and the thrill of Johnny English calamity is less original and focused on me than the jokes without text of the personage Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Britain is in great difficulties.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spies network on the web, so that the identity of all active secret agents in Great Britain has become known, to the great disturbance of the agent in function, unfortunately a small role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop that causes the emmer to cross from the Prime Minister, a pretentful woman with problems at her head and terriblely unpopular as politic. Emma Thompson makes her best with this personage that reminds of Teresa May, but the script does not provide much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she must engage in a retirement spy, since every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English itself, who is now working as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but gives unofficial lessons about undercover work. Here are fun fun funny jokes in the story, because the spying lessons of English make a little think of School of Rock.
English is quickly banned on Whitehall for an emergency lettering and reunited with his former souly helper Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a turbulent and joviale role that is under Vicki Pepperdines level.
The Batman and Robin of the catastrophic conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are therefore back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's blood nice femma fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic technology billion who claims that he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin at their odyssee of cloudy delicious fun: dressed as obers they put an overlooking French restaurant in fire, they scattered herry on board the luxurious yacht of Volta and English untickets pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to get familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
For that last, all the registers are opened, but how well-intentionally and turbulent the scene is, she is thinking about child television.
It's all not very original.
And as with the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself the question: can the British film sector really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour denied that the party is a plan for four days a week to be paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan in which British will be paid for four days a week, but for five days.
Accordingly, the party would want companies to share the savings they are doing as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day holiday.
For example, employees can enjoy a weekend of three days, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea ‘approves’ in the Party's economic agenda and the plans to make the balance sheet of the country collapse towards workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Association of Associations, which makes it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranked source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “A policy revision will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place from one other moment, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's efforts to make the balance sheet in the economy more beneficial to workers and that also fits within the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party who supports such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in the national election campaign in 2017.
However, the efforts are currently not supported by the full Labour Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party's policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to withdraw the power of the "sightless drivers" and the "profitors" in utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, because a Labour Government could apply 'depreciation' on the basis of perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the boards of management of companies and to set up inclusive property funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) with which 10% of the shares of companies from the private sector are given to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' or the research of the FBI to Kavanaugh can change their opinion
The FBI's examination of accusations against Judge Board Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on its nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI could discover something that could cause them to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Do you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
The voice of Graham, however, seems to be wall-resistant.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has denied it strongly," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday is organized in New York the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will take place and that knows an even impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people for the Global Citizen Festival will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: terminating extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international interestsmen who hope to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting.
Concertgangers who wish to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as voluntary work, conduct a world leader's emails, conduct a telephone call or create a different meaningful awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 more years to reach this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince people to demand a call for action or is it just another form of 'kliktivism', people feel that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a second?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters have been registered, aimed at a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the introduction of world leaders and policy proposals to the value of more than $37 billion that must change the lives of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the Group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid out or brought together by sponsorship.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important intention statements belongs to The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom, with the aim of helping children realise their full potential.This group has promised $35 million to help Rwanda to end the country after receiving more than 4,700 seconds from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote in history of social injustices", Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the public during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions had been sent to the British government in order to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government has announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children will reach food interventions.
In answer to one of the many questions on the Global Citizen's website, which was asked "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
the group answered: "It will be a long and difficult way, where we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, like civil rights and anti-party movements before us, we will eventually be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will take place this year during the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian energy exports - Minister for Home Affairs
Washington may "if necessary" take refuge in the marine to prevent Russian energy from coming into the market, including in the Middle East, declared Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Minister of Inland Affairs, as indicated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the involvement of Russia in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legal government, is a prerequisite to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said the report.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has that possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for invited people during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a profit-making purpose that affords itself as the 'stem of the energy consumer' in the USA.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these were not substantially different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is much or more the use and replacement of fuels," he said and referred to Russia as a country that knows only a "art", with an economy depending on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when Trump's government tries to stimulate exports of liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country that offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of Trump government, including President Donald Trump itself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the 'inappropriate' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum of Berlin, made the 'inmate' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the strong opposition of Washington against the project is only sent by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the idea that energy should not be used to exercise pressure and that consumers themselves should be able to choose their suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Minister of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The American position has raised a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organization in Germany, called on the US to avoid dealing with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of Deutsche Industrie (BDI), after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren's 'thinks seriously' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts said on Saturday that she was "seriously thinking about" to participate in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the elections.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also involves a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newsletter The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll think seriously about making myself preferable as president."
Warren runs against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said he "send this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried to the bone about what Donald Trump is causing in our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and at Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a second on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for a study of the FBI before we vote on this."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of the Warren’s own appendix considers that it should not be preferable in 2020.
Twenty-eight percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be preferred, according to a survey by the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty-thirty percent of them were for her to choose.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% before a possible candidate and 48% against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former vice-president Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, senator from Vermont.
Prayer said that he would make an official decision in January, according to a report by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS of Track Palin at a election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he served in September.
He was arrested and accused of a mention of domestic violence Monday night.
"Through what my own son must experience, what he's suffering now he's back, I understand for other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the injuries that some of our soldiers return," she told the public who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and get harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other militarys have given for the homeland".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of domestic violence and attack on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police speaker in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. which refuses asylum to victims who flee for gang violence or for domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. have submitted a statement to the Washington Court in support of an asylum seeker fighting this policy last Friday, NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union has joined against federal policy in August has not been announced.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people are from which asylum applications in the US, as countries with great problems in the area of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision of the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals, allowing immigrants without documents fled for domestic violence to request asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney-general of Washington D.C., said Friday in a statement that the new policy "negates ten years to state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" in the statement of the "friend of the Court".
The lawyers continue to argue that the policy that denies immigrants' access to the US is damaging the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provide the necessary labour forces'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence in June.
"Asyle is available to those who escape their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political belief" said Sessions in his announcement on 11 June of policy.
Asylum was never intended to illuminate all the problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people are faced all over the world every day.
Wonderful rescue attempts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, trying to comfort her feverful baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Inhabitants came back to their devastated homes and searched in their nasty possessions for valuable items they could still use.
Hundreds have suffered injury and hospitals are overpopulated, as far as they are not damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
Some wounds, including Dwi Haris, who got a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of heavy naschocks.
Trains filled his eyes when he told his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remains of a wall," Haris told a correspondent of the Associated Press and added to that he was with his family in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and to our child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda advertisements'
A week after an official Chinese newsletter placed an advertisement of four pages in a U.S. daily, in which the mutual advantages of trade between the USA and China were expressed, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of the use of the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last referred to the paid annex of China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he had accused China of interference in the U.S. convention elections of 6 November, a accusation denied by China.
Trumps accused that Beijing was trying to engage in the U.S. elections, marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in a escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have increasingly imposed higher import rates.
China's reimbursement rates early in the war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in States such as Iowa, which support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the ambassador of the US in China and Iowa's governor for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American workers, farmers and companies.
"China", as Branstad wrote in a Sunday's Des Moines Register opinion, "doubles the intimidation now by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"During disseminating this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and a free press, a long - cherished tradition in America by posting a paid ad in Des Moines Register", wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, a kiosk in the centre of Beijing will find in vain different voices and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese population may have on the difficult economic route, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newsletters has refused to publish his article," as he did not say what newsletter this was.
By the Kavanaugh-debacle, the Republican women's electorate from just before the interim elections, warned analysts
Now that many major Republicans are around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, warn analysts that they will suffer a relapse, especially among women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions on this subject have been enormous, and most Republicans have already let know that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things can't be returned," said Grant Reeher, Professor of Politicology at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he wondered whether the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (Republic, Arizona) to plead for a FBI study at the last moment would be sufficient to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they haven't forgotten it tomorrow and they haven't forgotten it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday according to the newsletter from Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "November come on!" during their demonstration in the Senate hall, while the Republicans who have controlled the Justice Committee chose to approve the candidateship of Kavanaugh, despite the witness from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and the motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analist, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go further, especially among the floating female electors in the outskirts and among younger electors, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even if they do not agree with the president."
Even for the public testimony of Ford, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual intimidation against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a relapse could be followed if the Republicans would press the appointment.
"This has become a confused ruin for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican Party, last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in the committee, or about the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes place in the court, but it is also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it" says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to be elected Democrats, clearly to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be divided into the question of who they believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority turning off to the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe the witness of Ford, and that 35 percent believes Kavanaugh surely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh surely or likely lied during his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's intention, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations of Ford and of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford said last week before the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of drinking when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genitalia at a festival in the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plants a new Internet to handle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the option to choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joke that 'world domination' is the leading idea behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historical moment."
The app uses the Solid technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contacts, activity lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored here.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends fully on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
According to the CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides resources, processes and required skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, developers of technology worldwide can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to have a conversation with "Facebook and Google about introducing or not a complete transformation, making all of their business models completely in one time."
"We don't ask for their consent."
In a post on medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential vote in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will stay as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new age for the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Spiritual and carrier of the Victoria Cross from WO I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant-Colonel, the honourable Bernard Vann gained the distinction from the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharp shooter, so he never knew that he was the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was 'brilliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather had been distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his bataljon on September 29, 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mist and under severe fire of fieldboat and machine guns".
He later stormed through to the fireline and led the line forward before he only ran to a field shoot and switched out three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sharp shooter on October 4, 1918, a little more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something, I know that I can never do it, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid another crane after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt very dear to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the braveness of a real hero is shown by the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed all night to see Bellator 206 and received Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've stayed awake all night to watch a follow-up Bellator 206 and you won't see the most important moment.
13 fights were listed on the San Jose ticket, including six in the mainland, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just the time Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fighting, viewers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised when the channel switched on Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had been awake all night especially for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the child program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"In accordance with government regulations, after 6:00 a.m., no more content should be shown that is not suitable for children, so we had to switch to the child programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked to send it.
"Peppa has pig," yess.
Scott Coker, chairman of Bellator, said that they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that the viewers in the United Kingdom will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the reverse game, we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there went a lot of texts and once again and believed me, these weren't all even friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case, it was a public problem.
I can promise that this is not going to happen a second time.
We restricted the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual nature
The Olympic cleanspringer Tom Daley says that during his youth he felt inferior because of his sexual nature, but that gave him the motivation to get successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to continuing education, he did not realize that "not everyone is like I am."
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about homo rights to give 'hop' to others.
He also said that parentality had contributed to less value in winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show took out a few months because of disease.
Looking like a breakdown on Laverne's first program, Daley told him that during his youth he felt "less" than others because it was "not accepted to like both girls and boys".
He said: "To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are real facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "one" so he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally came out of his nature.
The winner of two sources Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he talked because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give "hop" to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he was in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, who he met in 2013, 'has surprised me completely'.
Daley married the Oscarwiner last year, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to stay so much so young," he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died three years later of cancer, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same height and low points.
In June the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "hele perspective" had been changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I had answered that it all turned to win a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at a age of 40, after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there anymore to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stuck and he died, I could finally recognize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew that I had dreamed about this all my life. To dive for a home public during the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, who had strongly attacked him on his way to the plays and still got chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is listening at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must see his shape back to make no sad milestone of it.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bank by the team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and training on the driving range, in an attempt to find out where it shakes.
Because he was never known even at the top of his career for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs deviating balls routines.
And if the job in itself is not awful enough, Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday comes the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four the matches this week.
If the Americans that are four points behind at the beginning of the 12 single matches, start well, the match of Mickelson can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, even though he could hardly say differently.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a knock on my back, hit his arm around me and said he was ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play only two matches.
I had expected more, but it's like it's and it's the way we're supposed to act.
He wants to be there, just like all the others."
Mickelson can improve the record of Nick Faldo for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely evolved the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his name, but Furyk said that his presence had a certain incomparable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to take fun of jokes with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked it occasionally to keep him crazy last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than only his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advance can disappear quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advance before single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be converted into a less comfortable situation.
The Deen made his debut in the game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with the captain Seve Ballesteros had a spring of five points on the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, called down here, after he had seen the lighting of 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, well for a jump of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all others in the team that this is not yet a game game.
Everyone will have to take full action tomorrow.
Go ahead and carry out the plan in the right way.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is this trophy, and we must continue to focus on it.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Congratulations about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead in the business in this area.
Tomorrow's waiting for a new challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will be addressed, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be on the outside with a partner if it's okay, but when you're alone, your capabilities as a golfer are not really tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he's got to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform more individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Fureich himself has experience with both sides of this kind reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every fucking word of that talk," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there is a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have adapted our line-up to this and send the men on the way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try to get something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counteroffensive and put Rory McIlroy in front of the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I chose this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new German warship has been postponed
The latest fregat of the German Navy should have been in service in 2014, to replace the aged warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and upcoming costs, local media reported.
The establishment of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the gloed new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregatten, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newsletter Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the marine in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have plagued the destiny of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered the marine in 2007 shall be used to replace the aged fregats of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful canon, a series of air-defense and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to put the latest fregats up to two years behind each other, far away from home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, have already been outdated by the time they are taken into operation, notes that time.
Last year, the fatal fregat F125 brought all the newspaper heads, when the German Navy officially refused to operate the vessel and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it was put into a fight mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 seamen, half the manpower on the fregats of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship has a serious overweight, which will reduce performance and limit the capabilities of the marine to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rhineland-Palatinate' weighs 7.000 tonnes, twice as much as ships of a similar class that were employed by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defected hardware, the price card for the complete project, including the training of the crew, becomes a problem too.
It is said that this has reached an incredible €3.1 billion compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems of the latest fregats are particularly important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of Parliamentary Defence Committee in Germany, acknowledged that the marine is actually "a shortage of employable ships".
The officer said that the problem over time as a snowball has grown, because old ships were removed from operation but no substitute vessels were supplied.
He complained that none of the fregats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a landery in the Scottish highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will make new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland is followed by the ordinary and small dwarf fold moisture, the brown large-floor moisture and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed on key locations around the estate to follow the activities of the batteries throughout the season.
Co-workers of the NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using manual detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the cries of the bat and what kind of thing is doing.
Then a map of the habitat and a report is produced to make a detailed picture of their behaviour on the landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS conservation consultant, hopes that the results show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the making of pastures and how we can keep the forests the best for bats and similar species.
Flemish moisture populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have decreased considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightnings can also pose a risk, such as flying fans and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Fleermuizen are in fact not blind.
However, their night hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
At the NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly investigate, inspections of beds and sometimes rescue actions.
The organization even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at Threave's estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal territory for the bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much about bats still not known, so the work we are doing here and at other locations will help us to understand better what they need to flourish."
It emphasizes the importance of control of bats before maintenance work is carried out, because the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boys, which may cause a complete local population to be eradicated.
Flemish mice are a protected species of animal, and it is illegal to kill them, to fall hard or to disturb or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Schots official for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to contribute to help.
She said, "We still have to learn much about our bats and from many of our species we just don't know how their populations are concerned."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to follow a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo's accusations of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people want to 'promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to complain of the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the accusations have been published.
The peak of Portugal and Juventus is accused of the attack of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $35,000 to silence about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live called Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the accusations were reported, the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the field.
I'm a happy man, and through and through" the footballer added to this, smiling.
The lawyers of Ronaldo prepare a case in which they want to pursue Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'an inaccessible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage for a amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The supposed incident was said to take place in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, went back to the soccer's chamber, where, according to the accusation, he raped her anal, as read in the charge submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the supposed incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and he told her that he was a "good guy" for '99 percent' but that he is sometimes left that "one percent".
The documents suggest that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex but that this was mutually good.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were photos of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed with an outer court arrangement because she was "bang for the consequences" and because she was concerned about the "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to make the scheme invalid because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and left to the Italian giant Juventus this summer in a deal worth € 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' when car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom 'will have an eternal regret' if it loses its status as world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car producer said that the impact of delays at the border would cost in the case of 'no-deal Brexit' jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are manufactured, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that when Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see the production in our factory silence," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of a EU departure without agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already told us that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the concerns concern the car producers about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
Toyota's production line runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby every 37 minutes parts of suppliers arrive in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there can be annoyance at the frontiers that, according to industry, can lead to delays and deficiencies in components.
Toyota can't store stock in the factory in Derbyshire for more than one day, so the company informed, so in that case the production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'exactly agreed to avoid these controls at the border'.
"We have to have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also to take this chance," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, who is a representative of the Unite Association at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the Deputy Procureur-General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed a week while the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between assistants of Trump and Russia and possible barriers to the president's trial.
The question whether Trump will dismiss the Deputy Procureur-General and thus threatens the independence of Mueller, the Washington Ruddel Machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record talks with Trump and to postpone the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, the round he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted not to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to carry out an investigation of a week to the accusations against Kavanaugh, thus delaying the vote in the full Senate.
On Sunday Sarah Sanders, the press head of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Inquired at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date for this week, it might be this week, but it could also be postponed a week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had trouble with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by a rebellion of the 'attractive' TV journalists, although, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President makes more question and answer sessions than any president for him," she said, without giving evidence: "We have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, this is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do that much, and you have seen us often do that in the past weeks, and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or at press conferences with dictatories who are visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president was able to demonstrate why, he made an open and bizarre appearance for the gathered reporters.
Minister for Health writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland's employees from other EU countries
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to the EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the desire to continue working at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying a fixed status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU continued during summer, and this autumn will take the expected decisions.
At the same time, however, the UK Government has also launched preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is achieved.
I know that these uncertain times must be for you all.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Collega's from all over the EU and outside, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and offer these benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is firm and sure you are at home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing a speed surgery after main injury
The Tennessee State Tigers linebakcer, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency surgery yesterday after he had suffered a major injury in the Vanderbilt Commodore race lost with 31-27, Mike Organ of the Tennessean reported.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State head coach, told reporters that the accident took place shortly for rest.
"He came to the sideline and fell in there much or more," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him with him for further research.
A official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that no details are yet known about the type/range of injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury has occurred.
Butcrombie, a red shirt sophoromore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer of Illinois.
He has been tackled for a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him tackled this season for a total of 18 times.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empty when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empty when buying a house in the UK and the yield is used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will need to neutralise the success of Corbyn to attract young voters
The increase in the empty is directed to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise € 120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher blanks when they buy a house in the UK and the extra yield is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will today announce.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn that attracts young voters with promises to ensure more affordable houses and to tell them on many ministers.
The increase in the empty is directed to persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional yields stacked in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes above the current empty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for the rental, may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £ 120 million a year in this way.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new construction in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which drive the prices up and it is difficult for beginners to get a foot on the housing charger.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practical "spoken cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had asked for a reduction in the empty ones to help young people buy their first house.
He accused large construction firms of maintaining prices by buying land and not using this, and called on May to cancel quotas in affordable houses to restore the 'house damage' in Great Britain.
Corbyn announced a striking series of housing reforms, including renting ceilings and an end to the expulsion 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "I said last year that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister in restoring the 'British Dream', that life becomes better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market should be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be as simple for those who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a house has ever become a vague dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head has already been too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his 'ulty ambition' to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of renewing the club from the northeast of England, currently at the third place in League One, at three points from the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership for the last season.
"As a footballer I already wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was selected for the B team and with this it was off" Ross told Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw with my father Scotland play often in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps dressing me.
But that possibility would only come if I were successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused avances of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Succes for me are currently measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
As a result of the structure and facilities in this club, it is undoubtedly supposed to be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years in his career as manager, after a period of time as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to win the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a crossing point," he recalled the time he took over the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed the management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizar, because I did the best, I earned pretty well and knew a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be heavy.
There's a lot of things you're confronting every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the trade, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and since I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in the summer has made the income rise by British pubs who have had difficulty surviving but also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw the turnover rise by 2.7% in July, but the income in restaurants were 4.8% less, show the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Office, who collected the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and the fact that England took longer than expected to participate in the World Championships, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had increased sales, with that difference that the restaurants were even harder.
The drop of 1.8% in the turnover of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars that are aimed at drinking sales dominated the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs who are also focused on the sale of food also from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people were only going out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, the drink turnover was 6.6 percent higher for the month, while the food turnover was 3 percent lower."
Paul Newman van RSM, analysts for the free-time and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for turnover in the outer market.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a 4.8%-year turnover is particularly painful in view of the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse moment for the operators who focus on food and will only learn the time if the more moderate temperatures of August could give the necessary respise."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed from 47 operating groups, with a joint turnover of £ 9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the branch.
One in five children has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years, has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden for parents and teachers, reveals an survey
Survey among 20,000 secondary school students revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students say to have a 'head account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years of age, makes accounts for social media that keep them hidden for adults.
A survey among 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of the students say that they use a clean 'head account' that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked others to "rape" her.
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools discovered that 40% of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half of them admitted to keep personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are attracted to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'stim of the athletes' in the Scottish Council for the Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of the Scottish Athletics World as non-implementing Director at the general annual meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated athletes in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great chance for the sports managers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys much respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from its election in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am glad to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help the sports in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 games in Atlanta, two of its four golden Olympic medals, and now regularly commenting on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only the time will learn whether I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terrible hard work, but I have now been completely restored, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support statements!"
Advertisement for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows divides online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has divided the online opinion with an ad in which sucking mothers are compared to cows that are molded.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent breast pump in the world', Elvie, producer of consumer technology, has issued an ironic, inspired ad on music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to colvening mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a shave filled with hay on a song that contains texts like: 'Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see anything' and 'If you didn't watch it, these are no uiers, these are my breasts'.
It continues with: 'Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady'.
However, the ad, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, immediately provided an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the 'horror' of the dairy industry is condoned.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must get in expectation and fall to produce milk, but in their case, the babies are taken away within a few days after the birth" are written in a reaction.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into a nutrient beha (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else said, "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilaric'.
"I think this is a genius idea.
I would buy one if I were still breast-feeding.
Those pumps gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a genial product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms that collapse (fast at the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like being just 'cook'.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative on the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you can see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreet hidden in their behas.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who collapse sometimes feel just cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly in a nutritional beha, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are on cocks.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD with Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is a so revolutionary product that it earned a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between cobbling mothers and milk cows, we wanted to put the colves and the associated challenges in the lights, and at the same time to show in a sustained and understandable way how the new pump will ensure an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants moves silently to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrants in prison has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the hard-fighted rhetoric and the hard-fighted policies introduced by Trump government make it more difficult to educate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to endanger their own chance to remain in the country by signing up for a child.
This risk has increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their households should give their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in a witness to the convention that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have registered themselves as sponsor for unleavened minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70% of the arrested persons had no prior penalty sheet.
"At nearly 80 percent of those who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal strangers.
We're prosecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials introduced new rules, allowing some of them to be obliged to appear before the court within 60 days, according to the staff at the shelter, within one month after the beginning of the detention.
Many of them will be present in front of the court through a video conference, rather than in person, to apply their application of a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in bondage, the greater the chance of getting anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or flight attempts, according to the staff at the shelter and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare for them emotionally or to say to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria recommends that the US, France and Turkey's 'occupying power' be withdrawn immediately
In a speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Al-Muallem also called on the Syrian refugees to return, even when the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice-Premier, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext to combat terrorism and that 'it will be handled accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced and driven from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian areas" from terrorist groups and from an "eventual illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-breaked country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are beneficial and he refused to spread irrational fears in some Western countries, which would prevent most refugees from.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They polite a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there is no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomates from the United Nations say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major bulk of the rebels, has created the possibility of launching political conversations.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned off a major attack from Syrian troops supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement knows "clear deadlines" and said that he hoped that the military action will focus on jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front, who will be "destroyed".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN Member, hopes to meet the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for after the Syrian war and to ease the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions of the Syrian government to take part in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be restricted "to revise the articles of the present constitution" and he warned against breach from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency is terminated in advance by a deposition procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic final of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of viewing.
Since 2014, the viewing figures at 'prime time' at CNN have been more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly threefold to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time' compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' of MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers at nights with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible one behind the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She recalls a taxi in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said then, 'Because he's laughing me,' Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike all the other on TV, the lines of story from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or decide whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Deactivate is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet, it's going to be more than a well-informed citizen, when you get in mind that you've been looking at a panel experts who discuss the use of sources from the ' deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who have talked about the jacket of Paul Manafort's jacket that cost $ 15,000 ('a clothing full of suspicion' according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
I'll never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's about a reality show, partly that he stops you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role division of the Trump show and the daily plot exchanges (a fighting with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea that you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while he took CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember that we did all these rare shows, not so long ago, and that the people said "This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization" said Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Delegates
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flood of money, thanks to a recast of a electoral district that has to fight two seated national representatives for the same seat.
The recently reclassified district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who acquired its seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it against another seated national representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a great deal of overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards have been reclassified after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January considered that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymandering') in the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district led to a knocking party in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congress Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a nipte victory in a well-looked special election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considered El Salvador to penalize for aid to China and have abandoned this.
Diplomates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Peking and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners took off the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States have decided to call back the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision to no longer acknowledge Taiwan' said Heather Nauer, the spokesman of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were only considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $ 140 million of U.S. aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials presented a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up at a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the attempts to prevent migrants from leaving to the United States.
But half September, some top officials from the government let know that they wanted the conference to continue, thus making all possible penalties against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence holds a talk at the conference, which is now planned for half October, as a sign of the importance the government confesses to the meeting, says diplomats.
And the three American messengers have returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any bad messages about Washington's penalties.
A spokesman of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomas, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report by the special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counteract of Trump's justice, which has now become publicly known for major evidence.
Mueller is probably also going to focus his research on cooperation between Trump and Russia's campaign in an attack of Russia on our elections.
If the Congress of Color changes, Trump must be responsible for that institution, just as he is preparing to address the voters again, and perhaps he must go to the responsibility of a jury in a court.
These are a lot of mites, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight will take.
In 1938 German officers were ready to perform a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had opposed and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed, which followed.
The course of history turns around such beneficial points, and this accelerates or delays the inevitable embarrassment of democracy.
Americans are currently faced with several of this type of benchmarks.
What will we do if Trump Adjunct-Procureur-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's research?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this magazine reported that he had suggested, last year, to take secret talks with the president and that he had speculated on the presidency's suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says the report of The Times is not correct.
"How will we react if the new requested research from the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I think we won't fail because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech jodin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me, 60 years later, away to stick candles for the Sabbath on the table on which a swastika was pictured.
With that as my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans van Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers get Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that after the impressive equation in Spain against Villarreal this month, a victory on the Austrians takes them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a knieblessure, the middle fielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first match from the season until the 2-2 equal game at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use the results as a jump plank to better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleventh number," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the idea that something fell to win and came out the game with a point.
Perhaps we could even have winning at the end, but over the whole game seen is a equal game probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
Comeing Thursday is a new big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it will become a difficult match because they also have a good result in their last match, but if the public is behind us, I am sure that we can press through and that we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been heavy, of all that happened to my blessures and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feeling-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully, we can push through now, leave behind the last season, and get successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of anxiety for their pension
Despite the fact that the participants at the survey had a clear idea of how they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in Nationalwide research said that they talk to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
"Mensen would like a family member to care for them, but they do not take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President for Life Insurance at Nationwide.
We're gonna start here.
Talk to your marriage geno(o)t(e) and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes good at time.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial adviser in the arm: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing choices may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenditures, or use the own resources as insurance, as long as you have money.
Setting up legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when insurance is to be deployed.
Care for a power to healthcare, so that you can designate a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals keep your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider a power for your financial affairs too.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on behalf of you and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can't do this again.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly father or mother hits a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies in that case?
Define these details in a written plan, so you have the information in hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that are important, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that plan is coming."
Man shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after an evening.
The victim, 40 plus, was located in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, stomach and hand.
Agents described the shit, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'random act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that death will rise further.
By dismantling the means of communication, the official authorities have not yet received information from Donggala, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of the troop with a force of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city fourth is 40th anniversary when the tsunami hit.
Donggala is a rainfall that extends over 300 km along the coast of Northwest Celebes.
The rainy, a administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the Central-Celebes province, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected by tsunamis in the past hundred years, according to the Agency for the fight against Indonesian disasters.
In 1938 a tsunami demanded more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine dead.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A great earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on North Sumatra on 26 December provided for a tsunami that hit 14 countries and took a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Atjeh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the scale of Richter took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that hit on the south coast and demanded almost 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the scale of Richter found Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the scale of Richter found one of the Mentawai islands, near the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded about 300 human lives.
2016: A deep earthquake hit Pidie in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, because people were reminded of the destructions of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami followed, but more than 100 people found death by decaying buildings.

Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on accusation of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-Presidentship, was arrested on accusation of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference on a report of domestic violence and opposition during the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female-known woman tried to call the police to report the alleged offences, he took the phone from her.
Palin is held in jail in the house of conservation Mat-Su with a guarantee of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in front of the judge on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, sure" when he was asked for this, the network reported.
Palin is accused of three violations of class A, which means that he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $200.000.
He is also accused of a violation of class B, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is accused of criminal offences.
In December 2017 he was accused of his father's abuse, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves for the veteran court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of abuse in the domestic atmosphere, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon affected by the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group in 2016 after having linked her son's violent behavior to PTSS that he would have kept over to his service time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the scale of Richter has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks are disabled while the expectation is that death will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are circulating videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York claim the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people have been killed, a rare penalty that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, according to the charge, used a hired truck from Home Depot to run an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he rided pedestrians and cyclists who came on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'deliberately' killed the eight victims and caused 'intentionally' serious physical injuries, according to the intention of the death penalty, submitted in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racist, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'great, cruel and corrupt'.
"Saifoello Habiboellajevitsj Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" stands in the intention statement.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was more than ten years ago that in the Southern District of New York a case was encountered in which the death penalty was demanded.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life-long prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after they had been sentenced two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, dated from Uzbekistan, did not show any resentment in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the Detectives that he felt good about his act, the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, told the police.
He did not appeal to be guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said that he was "naturally disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a debt confession in exchange for a life-long prison penalty without the possibility of liberty, will only extend the trauma of these events for all involved," said Patton.
Sajpov's defense had earlier asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Conservative Member says that NIGEL FARAAGE should lead to the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilise a people's army during a protest at the Conservative Party Conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the "hite" of the Euroscepticians, while one of Theresa May's own parliaments proposed to give him the lead to the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants to the march in Birmingham that the UK would 'be out' if Mr. Farage Brexit Minister had been.
But the challenge for May in reconciliating the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the ride while this is attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Concerners continued to continue and will try to close a deal with Brussels despite the constraints and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw 'Chequers in the prullenmand'.
He suggested that Farage should be riddled and the responsibility should be given for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he made the service, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added here: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the prullenmand."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own land."
Bone suggested that the public opinion had been modified since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has changed its opinion and wants to remain in the EU is totally untrue."
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the mars and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not in favour of voting, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure that we are elected.
Let Chequers fall and listen."
In a direct message to May, she added: "Presidents keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'heat' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of confidence between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They try to betray Brexit and we're here today to say to them, "We don't let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to put our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, the fire on the fire.
We mobilise the people's army of this country that has brought us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime, Remainers marched by Birmingham and closed this march with a meeting of two hours in the city centre.
A small group of activists swept with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour High House, jokes about the security problems of a party app of the Conservatives at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can ensure IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a full farce.
There's not something like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plants "to think well" about candidate for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she's going to think well about her presidency candidateship after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be reelected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican Member who was co-president of Trum's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculations that she might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
An attendant asked her if she would prefer the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to go to Washington to restore our defected government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after killing Wayde Sims van LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the death of Wayde Sims, basketball player of LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at a ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of the Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayed Sims got a shot wound in the head and died of its consequences," said police commander Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been interviewed and has known to have been present in the place of crime, possessing a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson is arrested without further incidents and is held in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98-metre junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 races and started the last season in 10 races. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per race.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has left him the victory after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders of Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from the pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits and let Hamilton drive in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton returned to the head after a wheel-on-wheel action, making it necessary for the Ferrari rider to release space on the inside after a double movement in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was the leader of the race for a time, because he stayed with his banquet and smiled at fast finish, so he could take Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Eventually, he went to the pits in the 44th round, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did the whole weekend greatly his best, he was a real gentleman and left me over.
The team has done his best for the places one and two" said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump spoiled senator Dianne Feinstein at a election meeting on Saturday on the fact that she did not continue to be the source of Christine Blasey Ford's selected letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at a election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford for the Senate Justice Committee; instead, he showed that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be "common, unlikely and untrue".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that takes place in the Senate the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and common and unlikely and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you pick?
You remember her answer... you've selected the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't select."
Well, wait a minute.
- No, we didn't like it, he added to this, in an imitation of the senator.
In July the letter in which the accusations to the address of Kavanaugh were sent to Feinstein was sent by Ford and it was selected in September, but Feinstein denied that her desk was the leak.
"I didn't keep Dr. Ford's accusations hidden, I didn't select her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she asked."
But the president proved not to believe her denial and he commented at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
On the other hand, the president suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes by the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual misconduct.
"They are determined to withdraw power, with all the necessary means.
You see the commonness, the ingenuity, they don't give anything to who they hurt, who they have to drive to take power and get the control back" the president would have said, according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have approved the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return contest with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with two goals by scores from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team alongside, before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen made the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to defeat Dundee in Belfast on Friday evening.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three races.
The opening hall of Dwyer came at 3:35 in the fourth minute on a assist of Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assistance with which Beauvillier doubled the spring, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt made the lead for the equalizer of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants entered the first rest with a lead, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team repacked and Bouchard brought them back to an equal position with a power-play-hole at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the race, late in the second period. He took care of the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic leader dies while he ensures that hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in a plane
An air traffic leader in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could safely rise on board.
More than 800 people have been killed, and many are still missing after a heavy earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Violent naschocks still plague the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-and-return road stations of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He continued to make sure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, who was ready at that time on the start track, could safely rise.
Then he jumped out of the traffic stations, when he thought it was collapsed.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before he had reached Palu's helicopter.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can rise to thousands and the agency for the fight against disasters of the country has been informed that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"Men assumes that the death count is still rising because many bodies were under the ruin and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the agency.
Golves reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where one will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a mother of 35 years old, told Sky News: "Every minute, ambulances are brought into bodies.
Cleaning water is scarce.
The mini-markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Wido from Indonesia arrived Sunday in Palu and he said to the present military: "I appeal to you all to work day and night so that all tasks needed for evacuation are completed.
Are you ready for it?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombok, with more than 550 people living.
Air Niugini is now saying that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that runs the flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one more man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sunk plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and Detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or its nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members, after the plane was watered during the landing on the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What caused the crash and what is the exact order of the events remains unclear for the time.
The airline and the American Navy both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and missed the landing.
Some witnesses think the plane has been shot over the landing course.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes told him that he and some others succeeded by wading the water that came to their means to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardessen were in panic and screaming and that he had no serious head wound.
The U.S. Navy announced that in the vicinity at work on a yard, sailors have also helped in the rescue work by bringing people to the coast with an inflatable boat before the plane went further into the 30 - foot [30 m] deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last 20 years 111 people have found death in crashes of airlines registered at the PNG but that does not relate to Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night when a woman has been burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisite on Friday in the reopening process of a man who is accused of the alive burning of a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analist of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, gave a few hours of witnessing as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear for the jury how he used the phone call data of mobile phones to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night in which she left life.
Rowlett told him that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford again.
Sanford was in the witness bank on Saturday and said he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis to speak the truth when he said he was in his truck at Sanford during that night, Sanford said he was "because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone data indicated that they only knew each other one week.
Rowlett said Tellis knew the texts, calls and contact details of his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He knew her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to start the discussions later that day.
The High Breed: What is "conscious hiphop"?
A hiphop trio wants to discuss the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hiphop is alienated from the origin of political opinions and the mapping of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently revolved in Great Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.

A young man from New York dares a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A childhood youth from New York succumbs a couple to the judge for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a mispatched text in which the mother complained about 'who' a black one again.
The couple denies being racist and calls the case 'depressing'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her distress when she discovered that the new girl, Giselle Maurice, was a negroid woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
'NEEEE WHEN SWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs Maurice twice.
According to the American newspaper de New York Post, the Plasco-Flaxman, who felt uncomfortable, released herself when she realized her blunder, explaining that her former child youth, who was Afro-American, had provided bad work, and therefore she had expected a Philippine.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice takes the couple before the court to get a compensation of $ 350,-- a day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bicycle internally with the family, although without contract.
"I want them to feel that you just don't do something like that," says Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple beat herself with regard to the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after, by insulting her, they were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not a racist, we told husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had insulted, even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Get out of here.'
About the case compare with 'depressing', Plasco said that his wife expected a baby over two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
"Are you going to persecute someone like that?
That's not so sympathic," the investment banker added.
While the case is still running, the public opinion is quick to captulate the couple on social media, where it is healed for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly raised letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to get in the shoes of someone who read it first, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about the enormous success of Paddington, it is very pleasant."
She told her father who, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, as cameraman worked at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be dismissed. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book 'bitterzoet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very prominent member of the family," she told that her father was secretly proud of the final success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so real for him, it seemed almost like a child’s performance; you are proud while you did nothing for it yourself.
I think he experienced about the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own performance, he honored the bear himself for the success.'
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her by phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad had called several times to say it was very bad and it was expected that she wouldn't get it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then the call from Nad came to say that she would die within two minutes and that I had to take part from her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love your treasure so much.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly worked out and left her body.
She died some time before, and this process turned everything further off.
I could just sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't be sorry, shout, or cry, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I really had to keep myself big."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the death of her daughter, went into the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she had to face.
"Nobody knew it," she said.
"I sat down with my head, and the tears remained.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Raw women place messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are strongly strong to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs Davis, her son, Tyler, was 13 years when he first became depressed, and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any older to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45 years old and live in Lydney in Gloucestershire County, says that her son was a promising chef chef with an instinct grin.
"He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile illuminated every room."
Yet he already stopped working for his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found him after robbing himself of life.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about a chain reaction."
Mrs Davis has made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and where you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't stay silent - talk about it.'
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sober or depressed or something," she said.
'A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely on the ground on the First Christmas day - when the children packed their gifts he didn't look at them at all or something."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they should handle it, "It breaks the whole family apart.
It's gonna disperse us.
But we all have to continue and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain while FBI starts research
'I thought that if we could actually get for each other what he asks; a research limited to time and size, we might be able to create a little more unity,' said Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart, in the middle of a strongly anchored patification within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican followers not want the FBI to initiate an investigation?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been in five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans do it bad, their attempts to get their husband chosen in the highest court in the country are seriously troubled.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus his wife, Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI has finished the report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 republicans and 49 democratics.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Mike Pence, Vice-President, the opportunity to give the definitive vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh for the High Court.
Number of overlappers in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean overlappers has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-Seug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Onewording, declares that last year there were 1.127 overlappers, compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for human smugglers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang did not respond in public.
The vast majority of North Korea conquerors are finally offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest outline with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavyly secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the overlappers as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often exerts them with violence.
The relations between North and South, which are still formally capable of war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Previously this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, which was mainly spoken about the steady negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the US, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, in which they agreed largely to work for the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in removing the U.S. penalties since then.
'Without faith in the US', too, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament,' said Mr Ri during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him unqualified to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Delegates, Nancy Pelosi, called candidate judge for the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterically', and finds him inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help to think that if a woman was to behave like that, she would be called "hysterically," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate Committee for Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes shouted almost and was particularly distressed when he told about his family and his middle school.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'great and coordinated character murder' organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi declared that she found that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he was not suitable to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats," said Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether she would try to impose an impairment procedure against Kavanaugh if he would be appointed, and the Democrats would receive the majority in the House of Delegates.
"I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth in the Congress, or against the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he is now serving," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently judged by the Court of Justice of the 'District of Columbia' (mostly abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh will speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (law for affordable health care). Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh presented questions on the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
"Don't expect us to stand glad when a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed in the Supreme Court," said Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a righteous tyre of months and years of excreted anger that passes over, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We're gonna cry when we get angry," said Mrs Steinem 45 years later to me.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere leading and who told her that she was going to cry when she became angry. She developed a method, where she was always crying when she became angry. To the one she spoke to, she said, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she was just crying.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Trains are partially allowed to express anger, because crying is essentially uninterrupted.
One of my best memories from an earlier job, in a man-dominated office, was when I had to cry terriblely because I was angry. An older woman, a murdered business leader who was a bit scared of everyone, grabbed me into my neck and swept me into a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy they've got you on the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then member of the Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his presidency candidateship.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was engaged in an extramarital affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (formally means 'catching' or 'apenstreken') and retreated from the race, Mrs Schroeder thought that there was no reason why she would not be a candidate.
"It wasn't a well-considered decision," she told me 30 years later laughing.
"There were 7 other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone talked about "Snew white and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with funds recruitment, so she promised not to be involved if she couldn't bring $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1000, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting discounted?" she wondered.
When she held her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she snatched into it.
"They'll have thought I got a nerve winking," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media responded to her.
"They're gonna have thought that Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the USA and China can evade for Beijing
The opening balances of the trade war between the US and China were overdoving, and although the struggle has not been struck for a long time, a gap between the two countries could be able to exclude long-term experts from Beijing.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, gave the first warning this year by increasing taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (EUR 150 billion) to goods; half of all the goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken into natura represailles every time, most recently by increasing prices from 5 to 10% for US goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to compare the US every time, and the world's second largest economy is probably not going to blink quickly with the eyes.
To allow Washington to be bended, requests must be granted, but publicly bend for the US is much too painful for Chinese president Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays it smartly, the trade war with the US could support China in a longer term positively by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions, which could bring one of both countries into an economic free fall, is actually much more dangerous than the spectators,' said Abigail Grace, a research collaborator of the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specialized in national security issues, which focuses on Asia.
Syria 'clear' to return refugees, said Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a more than seven-year war.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the circumstances in his country improve.
"Today, the situation on the spot is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues rehabilitation of territories devastated by terrorists and normalizing the situation on the spot.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the one-sided economic measures threatening their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are about six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept any conditional assistance or assistance from countries who had subsidised the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with an endscore of 16.5 to 10.5 at the 'Le Golf National' golf course in the southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish commander Thomas Bjorn won the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the U.S. team, Phil Mickelson, who had been fighting almost the whole tournament, allowed his long blow from the tea to land into the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shined in all its rounds and became one of the four players who ever took 5-0-0 since the tournament started in 1979.
The U.S. Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The most classed player on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may have played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, ever became the best European player of all tournaments with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a hard year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we've got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotioned Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the fake to his landmate, John Ram, who swept down the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes and slew 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The tremendous pride I feel because I've beat Tiger Woods, I've always followed that guy when I grew up," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the largest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level tournaments throughout the tournament.
The U.S. commander, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: 'I'm proud of these guys, they've struck.
Soon this morning, we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We were opposing.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud of being their leader.
You have to take your hat off for the opponent.
We've been overplayed.'
Red gloed update: Concentrations decrease in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report from the 'Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission' (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Vis and Fauna) shows a general decline in concentrations of Red gloed in parts of Tampa Bay Area (located on the west coast of Florida in the USA).
According to the committee, it is reported on fragmentary increases in red glow in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The red gloed extends over an average of 200 km coastal line, from northern Pinellas to the southern Lee counties.
There are about 16 km from the coast of Hillsborough County spots, but in less places than last week.
Rode was also seen in Pasco County.
Mean concentrations have been reported on the coast of Pinellas County last week, low to high concentrations on the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations on or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
It continues to be reported on irritation of the airways in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In the northwest of Florida there was no mention of irritation of the airways in the last week.
