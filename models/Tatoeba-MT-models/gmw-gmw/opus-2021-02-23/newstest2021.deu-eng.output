Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest aids infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the plant.
A security service monitors the expiry ban.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positively on the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau reported on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we have to go this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the occasion of the series test.
The plant is a large vegetable farm, the earthberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red bee - but the cucumbers only for legglasses.
Mamming is a rural community with well 3300 inhabitants close to Dingolfing with its large BMW work.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to maintain peace: "After our information, it is a closed circle of persons".
On the farm, infected persons were separated from uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a locker fence.
Greens and SPD gave co-responsibility to the government.
The two opposition fractions pretended Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect control of the accommodations of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly avenged when such local infections have to be triggered and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, parliamentary director of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "We have already requested a special control programme for farms with harvest workers after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof Schlachthof in mid-May," said environmental expert Florian von Brun.
"According to the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be carefully monitored from our point of view.
This has obviously not happened."
The outbreak had come "with announcement".

There was no danger from an incoming train.
As the police tell us, there was again conflict between the two people.

Report: Seehofer urges longer storage of stock data
The stock data storage is currently suspended.
However, after a media report, Bundesinnenminister Horst Seehofer demands an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) demands, after a media report, an extended storage of stock data - instead of the planned ten weeks for half a year.
As reported in the "Image on Sunday", Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a rapid change of law.
Seehofer therefore seeks to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He considers it useful to "make necessary adjustments in the law already now", quotes the letter newspaper.
Currently, stock data storage is suspended.
It is expected to make a decision by the ECJ.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes beforehand so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, says the report.
A spokesman of the Ministry of Justice said to the newspaper that it would only be useful to examine whether legal adjustments were required if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already agreed to store stock data in June.
NBA: Stripclub fighters for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball professional of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is supposed to have admitted the visit according to ESPN specifications, is back in Isloation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that the NBA Williams had ordered a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers Star thus misses the first two official parties after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the seasonal finals starting in the night on Friday.
Söder is expressed after mass infection to the corona layer
Munich - Minister for Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has announced a testofsive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has shocked authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm, nearly 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working, over a third has been infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is locked off with a building fence.
No one can leave the site, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the well 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the court.
"knowledge bites": confession of the suspected firestifter of Nantes
"My client has shown himself cooperatively," said the lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was an liberation for him."
His mandate was "puffed by conscience bits and taken very much from the extent of destruction".
According to the prosecutor, the man is threatening ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Sankt-Peter-and-Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged in the night on Saturday last week in a fire.
The fire was broke out in three distances in the church.
Laboratory examinations hardened the suspicion of burning.
The now imprisoned suspect had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent penetration into the church, he quickly came into the view of the investigators.
Discussion about abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel recommended to think about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss, set conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," Grindel said.
He stressed: "For the associations that can become the most dangerous Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not about whether it is not required to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations who want to break into this Phlanx."
However, he doubted whether in the German football league there was the willingness to allow majority shares prohibited by the 50+1 rule in the Bundesliga.
"It remains a legal risk to move investment to a European internal market around the location of Bundesliga," Grindel said.
The former DFB Chief sees the risk that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even a equal distribution of the TV funds will not achieve a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three associations alone.
The other 15 associations have an average household of 130 million", said the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Leider there have been people who noticed this error and have pierced to the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of a expensive clock that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has already been very busy for me."
He had received the gift of about 11,000 euros from an Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a compliance breach, and it was right to draw out the consequences," Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I have been completely transparent and unforgivable.
There were many in the DFB who knew about it."
He never made "a hail out of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naiv, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a Dead

Investigations have been recorded.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes despite Corona
Although the large sauce in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was uncommon for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party miles in the city centre were missing, the masses and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy ball or transhipment, many came to their expenses in the Corona-conforming program.
"I think we have been able to spread Rakoczy flair," says Kurdirektor Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, you will return to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, as the historics alone were in the focus of the festival.
Comfortable Atmosphere
Vesna Konhausen has been visiting Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen for more than 25 years.
This time in the Corona year.
The couple have made it cozy at the Luitpold-Casino, the historians watch when flaning and listen to Cuban live music at the playbank restaurant.
"I also like it so pleasant," says Konhaus.
She misses the masses of human beings that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
For this, however, it lacks the usual program highlights, all of which will burn on Friday evening as well as the historic transhipment and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's awful.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy rider should take place again
For the performers of the historical Kurasts, the alternative program meant partly more work.
About for Christina Gold, which works in a normal year on the festival train and can be seen on the cocktail of the Kurgartencafe.
This year she was traveling in Costüm on foot in the city on Saturdays and Sundays.
"That's more struggling, otherwise we've got it easier," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even though individual riders were travelling in the park.
"We hope very much that the horsequadrill will be allowed to take place next year," says Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021, a Rakoczy rider should also take place again.

Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just setting out with the team the framework conditions, how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper".

Argentina rejects the counter offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires informed on Saturday.
"That would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," said an opinion.
"With 50 percent of children living in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer viable under the current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to refrain from some of their demands of around $66 billion (about EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country threatens the state squares again.
It would be the ninth payment failure in Argentina's history.
Lastly, the creditors had requested higher interest rates on state bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
However, the Argentinian government holds its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was last more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect to reduce economic power by about 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid interest claims of $503 million and was thus induced into a limited default of payments.
Emergency arrived - not yet private
"It's running super good" - this conclusion attracts Dr. Stefanie Kramer after their first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that in the Eggenfelden Notariat's office, she will follow Lutz fields.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctorate took up the work, the normal day business has long been running on full tours.
"I have to arrive, however", she explains in conversation with the Rottal advertiser and laughs.
Of course, the short preceding period has not been enough to move the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden completely, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She and her husband, who is a judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband could still request a short-term parental period to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to dive from Regensburg every day, she also has an opportunity to stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Grown up in the neighbouring countryside, the city of Eggenfelden is of course a term for a long time.
During local visits with her family in recent months, she recently observed: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
The more she was pleased that she had made the race in the selection process around the free place.
She also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's career course in Niederbayern: After the jura study in Passau, she spent her referendariat time and the second state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as Notarassessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu, and Regensburg - at that time she also trained the promotion in labour law - she took her first place in 2012 as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016, she went in her parental life, eventually following her move to Regensburg.
Since then she took over representation services in various notariat bodies.
When the job in Eggenfeld had been written for the close retirement of Lutz Fields, it had seen the right time for full recruitment, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the notariat agency, has fully taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has a commendation for the team of the firm parat: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private food point.
In the field of children's garden respective cribs, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks of the Red Valley.
BVB plans to start with a maximum of 15,000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled with 20 percent for the season start in case of a fan return.
"According to the distance control that must be complied with, we plan with 12.000 to 15,000 viewers at current level," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer for the "Tagesspiegel".
Usually, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 viewers at Bundesliga games.
In the spirit games caused by the Corona pandemic of the past season, the BVB per party had lost around four million euros.
The Cramer responsible for Marketing, Digitalisation and Internationalisation, responsible for the BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal viewers' spots, some of the approximately 4000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the accounter if these revenues completely break away."
In view of the persistent corona crisis, all are currently "advised to take a stable side length first".
"If many companies are not good and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need is limited to entertainment," Cramer explained.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chief praised the BVB profit for their salary part-refusal to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their loss of salary has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in Merchandising on short work."
Little miracles: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
A little harder than a packer butter, just three dining spoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 early children who are cared for annually at the Grazer Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weighs less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early born that neither lung nor intestine nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they're so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made mini rings for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be with voice - "and like," Berndt URLesberger smells.
"Even if, of course, they don't cry as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theatre in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage had the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the theater of the city of Aalen presented the production "The Home Dress" to the students - by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange with the actress and director Winfried Tobias over the piece and the performance.
Born was the idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of teaching.
Even though at the conclusion all parties agreed that the direct encounter in theatre and stage room would offer additional stimulation, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," stressed director Winfried Tobias.
First round released: The TSV in 1860 would meet in the DFB pole at the engagement of Frankfurt
If the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB pole, the lions will meet in the first round at the Eintracht Frankfurt.
This was the result of the release on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty-three possible opponents in the first round of the DFB pole stand firm.
The lions would meet with Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was done in the ARD sports show on Sunday evening.

There the lions meet either on the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If Zweitliga-Aufsteiger Würzburg reached the finale, Sechzig would already be well qualified for the first round in the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to continue in the final game against regional liligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB pole will be held between September 11 and 14 and thus a week before the third party start.
"From Winde confused": Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died in Paris on Sunday with 104 years of natural death, confirmed her speaker of the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the South State Epos "From Winde widowed" (1939).

Kalbitz-Rube from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Figblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the view of the FDP only a "fig sheet" and does not change anything to the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the legal extremities in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of negotiations, the Bundesgerichtsgericht der AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board had decided in May.
Kalbitz is Chairman of the AfD Group at Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD really was about removing legal extremists consistently from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and its followers would have long been excluded," said Strasser.
"On the other hand, there is no political will in the AfD because legal extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, doesn't say anything and doesn't change anything," he said the "World Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes, how many French supporters still have a legal exterior in the middle of the AfD."
Flower assumes that the AfD will again land below five percent in elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesman of the officially dissolved "flight" around the Thüringer AfD country and group chairman Björn Höcke; constitutional protection acts as "protected right extremist strife".
In May, the AfD Board of State Kalbitz had thrown out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not given an earlier membership in the meanwhile forbidden legal extremes "Tomathweal German Youth" (HDJ) and in the Republicans.
Kalbitz disputes membership at the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-fraction at the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Bundesgerichtsgericht did not change the character of the AfD: "The Wolf has only eaten Kreide.
The AfD remains an extreme right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
This decision does not weaken the Federal Party or the right wings.
"The manoeuvre of the meuthen trumpet is perceived.
One wants to avoid a further observation through constitutional protection and attempts to endure under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD won't get rid of the spirits she called.
There is no change in a rush there," commented the SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the Group held their right leader to this day."
The legal dispute about the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would act against the decision of the Federal Decree.
Nordsee-Windparks deliver well 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 torahwatt hours of electricity into the network.
These are well 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet informed in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The wind plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have supplied further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) electricity.
In total, the wind current from the North and East Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to well 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest on the sea represents almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than one year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher production capacity
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher production capacity because new wind farms have been on the network over the last 12 months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were to run all at the same time with full power, they could generate 6.7 gigawatt electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatt.
Until 2030, it will rise to 17 Gigawatt in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and in the Netherlands, we invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet business leader Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms can also not exploit their capacity on sea, but reach approximately 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatt electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide electricity for almost seven million households.

Freital: Windbergfest for Corona canceled
The Windberg festival does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and hoped, in consciousness, how difficult it is for the participants, until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partyless).
"But, in the end, we are responsible here for the health of many thousand people."
For if tens of thousands were flown into the fixed ground and the fixed tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and a follow-up to contact in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation could not be complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not be much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and supervisory burden would increase in proportion by a multiplicity.
Rumberg was disturbed next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence, among other things, with the winter mountain festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.

Future more flight slots in Worms
The Worms University continues to ventilate: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" creates a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS was now signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility of allowing the start of the study not only in summer but also in winter semester.
This enables twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacity at both the university and the air navigation academy of the DFS is evenly exposed.
The DFS will consult the university in the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Represented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in their training for flight slots at the University of Worms have been in the Air Traffic Management course.
This year nine students started.
The experiences of the DFS are very positive so far, the performances of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lottery training contributes significantly to increasing the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy for us.
We hope, however, that air traffic will recover and date again in the long term.
In order to meet our legal order in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS in signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide flight slots with a broad, technically cross-border knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer".
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The foundation professorship is an important bridge between science and economy.
With it we would like to join the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor Study Programme Air Traffic Management".
The trust of German Air Security should be for the University of Worm's motivation and the obligation to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future areas of air transport.
With the use of tomorrow's flight slots, the university with the first foundation professorship for a dual study course could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Science, Training and Culture, emphasizes: "The University of Worms, with its focus on air transport, has an all-setting feature in Rheinland-Pfalz.
The signature of the cooperation agreement today strengthens the profile of the university".

Healing wants to check for meat industry other industries
The Corona crisis reappeared the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
There are short-term deteriorations in the law.
But are they right - and will it stay there?
Federal Minister for Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries according to the strict rules that are now planned against misconstances in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective sector if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer already warns against general restriction of work contracts.
After the massive corona outbreak at the Fleischriesen Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Bundeskabinett wants to decide a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Great slaughter should not be allowed to use foreign workers in the case of slaughter, crushing and meat processing.
It is intended to prohibit the use of work contracts and loans workers there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said: "Finger away from a general restriction on work contracts and leaves of workers if you do not want to completely throw down the economy".
Working contracts, for example, are imperative for large areas of craft, construction and plant construction, for example, the basis for their value added to customers.
"The errors of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Healing assured: "My goal is not to prohibit work contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are useful.
"When an industrial company orders a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a very normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and loan work alone in its industry to be constitutional.
It should not be explained why cheese should be transported and packed in the future different working law than in the case of sausage, says an opinion on the legislative project, as reported in the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Samsday).
According to a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Many Eastern European workers from works contract firms worked in the industry after the results of an examination of the NRW Labour Protection Administration partly 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Remuneration was reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the housing of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these have been surrounded by "trucky constructions".
"Now basically must be cleaned up."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide in the cabinet at the end of July, are also measures that concern not only the meat industry - for example higher testing rates in the work protection or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry and the labour protection law.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would wish that we could do even more controls in many areas of supervision: food control, animal protection, everything possible, for example animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday at the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg Aktuell".
However, more personnel are also needed for more controls.

Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming gate of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total of 36th Scudetto of the club history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before mid-term.
With 83 points, Turin, who did not get the last long injured ex-National player Sami Khedira, is no longer pushing out of place one of two games before the end of the series A season.
Inter Milan's table side is seven points behind.
In spite of optical superiority in the first half of the period, Juventus was harmless, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a release.
The 35-year-old used to play Miralem Pjanic directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved on 2:0, after his shot dusted Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
This ensured the glossy but crucial success.
The foulelfmeters sprayed to the late in the 89th minute only Ronaldo itself should have been very angry with a view to the Torjäger valuation.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," explained Trainer Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turinians couldn't make the championship perfect yet.
Lastly, Juve also owes to the weakness of the competitors the calming advance at the top of the table.
Because in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday the Sarri team had only succeeded in five victories.
Whether Ronaldo becomes a gate-protected king is questionable.
For while the Portuguese superstar has reached 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro property has already reached 34 hits on his account, as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the FC Bayern's title gain.
The record in Italy holds the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentineian achieved 36 goals for the SSC Naples in 2015/2016.
In August, the "Alte Dame" of the Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is the eight-eye final of the Champions League, but on August 7th, he has to compete against Olympique Lyon with a 0:1 playground in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal authors recorded
Stuttgart - All threatened penalties and judicial judgments Despite the fact that automobile drivers continue to give gas in countless illegal races on the bath-worth-temberg roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal authors.
There are no comparative values for the previous years, but the lawns are increasingly working to the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigation procedures for illegal races were conducted in the state attorneys between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later, 252 were already and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The races were less about organized events, as shown by the Interior Ministry’s response to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases the drivers had spontaneously attacked each other, or they had taken the escape from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
In the tax, German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were mainly sitting at the tax.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racians caught and also asked for cash: The Ministry of Interior says that a total of 113 penalties have been imposed since 2018 and 15 penalties have been issued.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal authors actually rises.
Rather, other drivers responded more sensitive than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of the past years and showed more often, said one ministerial speaker.
In Rasern the motorway is particularly popular 8. Always brake car drivers there to provide space and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen driver was caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier, even 18 drivers at the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "Rennstrecke"
On the A81, the police registered even more races than on any other German motorway.
With a pace limit, there is attempted to brake the Raser on the particularly affected section between narrows and geisings.
The most highly priced and well-moved sports and luxury caruses often have Swiss marks, because the drivers avoid racing to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and authors in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the pace limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres of hours, we would create this problem from the body on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic experts of the SPD country-day fraction.
"The inhibitor threshold for lawns would be significantly higher if you would not be legal with 200 kilometres and more on the way here and there."
Rivoir holds less of clarification or image campaigns: "He who in such a way ignores all rules and does not only put his own life at risk, but also the life of other traffic participants is hardly accessible with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
This is not enough for ADAC: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred from the pace limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and more stringent controls on the relevant routes.
Not rarely, the high-tourized force measurement becomes more painful and severe: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races throughout the country, of which two unparticipated in a nighttime crash in Stuttgart’s city center and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were supposed to have delivered an authorenne in November.
One of the vehicles came from the road, collapsed against a garden wall and remained on the side that died 18-year-old passengers.
21 other people have been injured in the races of the last two years.
However, heavier penalties are not necessarily required by Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "The need for action to sanction illicit motor races is not seen," says the Ministry of Interior.

Numbers of work agency: 900 suspicious cases of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Labour Agency (BA) says that about 900 suspicious cases of abuse in the short worker's money are going on.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies who have shown short work," said Daniel Terzenbach, CEO of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
As at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a lot of companies had suddenly requested short work, the BA had to respond quickly.
Usually the test lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available in this hot phase.
More precisely, we'll look at the final accounts.
I'm sure it'll be a lot more.
We are not naïve and have a long breath".
References to abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA analysis software is used to identify misuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency drum in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments are different, but we are waving ourselves for the case and are already training our employees in the working agencies for the processing of insolvency fees applications."
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.

According to media reports on Saturday evening, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanjah's office.
They protested against unemployment, corruption, and Netanjah's dealings with the Corona crisis.
The protesters hit drums, blew in horns and called Netanjahu for resignation.

Also in many other places in Israel, people demonstrated, including before the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.

North Korea rushes border city to Corona suspicion
To date, North Korea saw a "lightening success" in its own measures to defend the Corona virus.
Now, for the first time, the country reports about a suspicion.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea, feared a catastrophe, has completely locked down a major city.
Despite the most strict epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been dragged into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency station had been imposed.
The Communist leadership called the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspicion be confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the fired country.
North Korea had, according to its own information, not registered any infection and described his defense measures as "lightening success".
The information was doubted abroad.
According to the reports, the symptoms of disease were identified by a "reducer" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South Korea and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had moved to South Korea three years ago and had now returned over the border.
There was no confirmation from South Korea for the crossing of the border within the four kilometres wide and mostly maimed military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, reportedly by the National News Agency Yonhap, recognized the possibility of an illegal crossing to North Korea.
There were investigations to some people.
According to North Korea, on Saturday, the suspicious case called for an urgent meeting of the Worker Party Polit Office, chaired by Kim Jong Un.
The "hazardous situation in Kaesong could cause a fatal and destructive disaster".
On Friday Kim had already ordered a preventive measure to block "Kaesong completely and isolate every district and region from others," it continued.
The affected person as well as all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her had been quarantined.
Accordingly, the central military commission of the Party is to investigate the "relapse" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and to impose, where appropriate, severe punishment.
It is estimated that some 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Voltage before Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still ahead of a big summer break to discuss
"In addition to environmental topics, the committee members will also vote on the construction plan for the capital development east," says it in the middle part of the urban press release to the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28th at 16.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city is being discussed controversially until the end.
The majority of these are scarce, even dismissing in individual committees depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), which was developed from the citizenship and then from the administration and municipal council, not to fail now after nearly ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "except parliamentary opposition", "unreasonable", "speculation", "suppression" and "conscious false statements".
"All think they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the citizens' list Pforzheim.
In fact, he is after reading the Treaties in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit is cheaper to the city that the Technical City Hall is in contrast to the statements of the city administration according to grants, whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than in the town hall and on the part of the advocates of the economy.
The city by its own power and not by creating an investor: this is his plan B. One day after little, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides essentially for the renovation of the Technical City Hall, the openkeeping of the castle, the renting of the Ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller downtown transformation in ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
The municipal council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many tempo reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of pace 30. However, politically responsible people in the city are not innocent of the fact that this should be so because by neglecting line bus traffic with diminished tacts and by little commitment to bicycle traffic they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and hence noise, according to the VCD.
The Council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, there is a agenda for accession to the State of Baden-Württemberg's Climate Protection Pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the urban children's day facilities and the request for entry into the Smart City Promotion of the Bundes.
Citizens are welcome, but Corona must take care of protective measures.
With much delay Tim Zimmermann starts in the new season
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann starts in his premier season at ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the league of the supersport cars can take up the regular operation, the first test trips were now started.
For Zimmermann it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking on his first service trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was accustomed to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the Porsche from the preseason," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS you have to go differently into the curves, for example.
But it really made a lot of fun."
Fun also had roomman with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite its only 25 years of experience, the Dutch has been in the GT sport and has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand ourselves blendingly and we have made tremendous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From July 31 on, the 33 supersport cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series new ones, knows the route.
He was last guest in Motodrom in 2015.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the route," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally in order to be fast".
How fast a roomman is then real, that's in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poker a little at the tests," he says.
"But we are finally very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly pushed calendar.
To the beginning of November, seven races take place.
Currently standing is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In the middle of August at the Nürburgring, ex-formula-1-pilot Nico Hülkenberg will take into the GT steering wheel.
British Minister for Transport of Quarantäne decision caught cold
According to the press reports, the decision of the British Government to put Spain's authors under quarantine for two weeks after their return, has coldly caught the State's Minister for Transport.
As a result, Grant Shapps is currently in Spain on vacation, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Due to the corona numbers rising in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which there is an entry without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to go back to quarantine after its return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returners.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the date of holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain is, by the way, considered to be one of the "secure countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"The number of ministers should have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine for holidayers will be imposed on Spain," commented the Labour Deputy Diane Abbot.
"But obviously no one has made the effort to tell Grant Shapp's."
Shortly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict starting barriers, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists are particularly responsible for the new spread of night life.
Spain is one of the British's most popular holiday countries.
The British government is currently reluctant from unnecessary travel on the Spanish mainland, the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, particularly popular in British holidays, are excluded from it.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the new corona virus and more than 28,000 dead have been registered in Spain.

FC Bayern München: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a relapse.
After a short holiday and a few training days, Hansi Flick recovered "sometimes well" after the first team training, consider how he can reconstruct his successful defense after the injury of World Master Benjamin Pavard.

Now it is still important to create the special," said Flick.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve, however, the eightelfinal attack against the FC Chelsea stands for the first time.
After 3:0 in front of the Corona break, the Londoners in the local arena should not again become the Bavarian nightmare as in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the door for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and tank trust with a good game," Flick demanded.

He welcomed 31 players at the Sebener Straße, including the new players for Edel-Shop Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the place after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has put himself well like all new ones," reported Flick.
However, instead of talking about the new season when Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to participate, Flick would rather talk about the current title project of the German Series Champion.
After days of the single and small group training, the team's strength for the Londoners is now trained, in contrast to the Flick ensemble in the game rhythm.
After that, the Munichers could face a quarter finale against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-final are real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin possible opponents.
A way to the Lisbon final "is not so easy," stressed the Chief Coach, who can trust in the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup recorder guard Klose and Flick know about so many common tournament preparations, which is especially relevant for the 0-to-100 match.
With his current team, the work is "a enjoyment", Flick praised.

At the tournament with Neuner teams, it was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the performers were involved, including the immigration-willing Thyago and Defender David Alaba, whose retirement beyond the king's season is not secured.

Greta Thunberg: Bad view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in the well-known Lassight show by Stephen Colbert via video switche and told in the interview what she had in her encounter with Donald Trump in her head.
Climateatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest by video switch in a popular US-Latenight show.
She told, among other things, about her fight against the powers of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad look" at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg, with her tireless use for the "Fridays For Future" movement, took attention to herself.
Now she spoke in a well-known Letight show about her plans in the future and her encounter with US president Donald Trump at the UN climate peak last year.
Lassight-Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg in your mission on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She spoke not only about their fight against climate change but also about their conflict with the powers of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people are going to divert the focus from the climate crisis," she shaken.
"Everything from organized hatred campaigns to threats only because a group of children goes to the street" she experienced.
Heads of State and leading politicians who spot against them in social media or even try to silence them find them "pleasant," as they show the reactions, "because they have no other answer to them".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw US President Trump a bitterly evil look back.
At the 2019 UN Climb Summit in New York, for which the Aktvistin sailed over the Atlantic, her excelling view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip a GIF was created, i.e. an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. President at this moment?
She answered the relatively open question of Stephen Colbert just briefly undry: "To be honest, I think that doesn't need any further explanation."
The experienced Satiriker Colbert had probably not counted with the ready answer and disappeared from the picture shortly laughing.
With her "How dare you?"-Rede on the principles of climate protection she remained in memory of many at the Climate Conference.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a motorway drive: after a rapid ascension with Fleetwood Mac, it went steep downhill and then slowly upwards.
Now the Bluesrock Guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult adherent: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He had died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, members of the family informed on Saturday in an official opinion that another opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton appreciated Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all previous and present members of Fleetwood Mac band.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-standing band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is forgotten.
The musician's life ("The End of The Game", "In The Skies") seemed to be a trailer.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There should have been disputes, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for beneficial purposes.
He began to appear in wide garments and with large crucifix.
Psychological problems should also have played a role.
Three years after the founding, Green left the band in 1970.
There was a social decline.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time Green was treated in the psychiatry.
During a large part of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the surface of the picture.
He was supposed to live on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in an Israeli Kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
He was excited in his early years for US blues musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At 11 years of age, he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play professional guitar and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band of Peter B's Looners.
He was replaced by the Bluesbreakers for his Idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues tree, Green founded in summer 1967 Fleetwood Mac along with his Bluesbreakers College Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid ascension soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not power the media rumble, its experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number-1 hit."
By the end of the decade, Green 1979 succeeded in a respectful success with an album inspired by religious topics.
Fleetwood Mac swims without him in new formation on a success wave.
Her album "Rumours" published in 1977 sold over 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not get a bigger comeback until he started with a group of friends in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returned to the earth.
With the Peter Green Splinder Group, Green released some albums free of drugs until the band was dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was a blues-leighing at lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists in the past decades.
