Fire deleted in French chemistry
The large fire in a chemistry plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is particularly dangerous, has been deleted. This told the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire was broke out in the night on Thursday. No one was injured at the incident. The firearm was in use with about 200 deletion vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainers were invited not to leave their houses. Buildings in the surrounding 500 meters were evacuated, schools and children's gardens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the shores of the Seine are manufactured additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
In the work, around 400 people work. In the past, the chemistry factory provided headlines - for example, when a leak in 2013 the methanthiol gas escaped and the environment widespread after faulen eggs smoked. In 2015, after an accident in operation, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's waste water system.
Ms. quits her job to look for 57 days after her disappeared hat
For two months, a woman from Washington looked for her missing dog - and announced her job for it. The seven-year-old Border Collie had been taken out of the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days from the Hündin missed any trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got bad," said Carole King the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Then, when they returned to the hotel, Katie disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "It's gone about four, four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie would be thrown out immediately. Probably a loud thunder had put the dog into panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But from days they became weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a post office to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flew"
57 days after Katie disappeared, Carole King got a call: A man reported himself and said that Katie started in his courtyard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her hat under a tree. "I just embraced her. I didn't want to let her go," recalled King loud "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flew. People stopped in their vehicles, rised out and embraced us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found them."
Losses in the Federal Army: Machine weapons disappear squeezelessly
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six machine weapons of type MG3 have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Federal Army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shot ammunition. Among them are three machine weapons. In most cases the retirement is unclear. The opposition speaks of a "angry" scale.
At the Federal Army, weapons and ammunitions are always disappearing - many of them have been unsuccessful so far. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has booked the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and nearly 20,000 shots ammunition. This is the result of a list of the Federal Defense Ministry, which the German editorial network reports.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, one armed part and 3474 shot ammunition have so far been reappeared. The still disappeared weapons and arms parts include six machine weapons of type MG3, eleven weapons of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal weapons and two P8 guns. In addition, 30 weapons of type MG3 are missing.
The volume of weapons and munition losses in the Federal Army was "anxious," said the left federal government member Martina Renner. This was all the more so, since in the course of investigations there was little to be found again. The left politician spoke of a "third balance". Racinger criticized that the listing was not clear whether under the disappeared ammunition the one was found in connection with the investigations against the underterror suspected German military officer Franco A. "And that although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian harbor
More than two months after its adoption by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data of Refinitive showed, the tanker was moving and left Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but first he remained in Iranian waters. The shipowner said that one wanted to wait for an official report from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" was imposed on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the Hormuz Sea Road under the charge of violating security regulations. However, it was assumed that Iran reacted to the controversial, temporary fixation of an Iranian oil tanker before the Gibraltar belonging to Britain.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil export is shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have been enormously sharpened over the past few months. The trade ship has been moved into the conflict between the USA and Iran. It has come to several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciatives the courage of people in the freezing revolution
Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel acknowledged the commitment of the people in the DDR who went on to the road 30 years ago during the fruitful revolution. In autumn 1989, courageous citizens had brought the then German regime into the defeat of the Thüringer CDU Group to the nearest day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor reminded, among other things, of the occupation of the Stasi Centrals. "The state security was taken the terror," she said.
Music aims at delivering records
Teslas Quarter may hold record ready. Despite delivery tree, there were recently losses in the electric car group.
New York.Tesla Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company with the view of new record numbers strongly on the stock market. "We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliverys," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musks Rundschreiben. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customership. To this end Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked that: Teslas shares went out of trade with an added of over six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered more than 95000 cars, thus reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records in order to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be made in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Puzzles solved: That's why we can't kick ourselves
A type of brake in the big brain prevents people from being able to kick themselves. This was found by scientists from the Humboldt University in Berlin, using experiments to rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress was also made in the question of why children are so heavily opposed to kitzeln, just to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why the approaching of a knitting hand triggers laughing before touching. This lies on a deep layer in the big brain, which already triggers laughing at the expectation of kitzeln.
According to previous research, rats have shown that when they are knitted by humans, they react with "smile" in the ultrasound area. This "smile" is conveyed by the part of the large brain cord which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Lachen is suppressed during self-contamination
So far, it has been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-consolation and touching by others – so people cannot knit themselves. The Berlin researchers have now found that in the experiments at the rats, the laughter as well as the activity of the area in question of the big brain cords are suppressed during a self-attack. This is also true when living creatures are cleaning themselves. During the foreign touch and kittle by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse was strengthened to laugh.
However, if the self-contamination and touch of others at the same time, the laughter should also be suppressed. This suggests that the rat's brain could not be distinguished between self-attacking and touching by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot kick themselves because the self-contact activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats were also trained to knit themselves. Thus, sometimes in the experiment, they broke off this initiation in advance, showed escape behavior or terror. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the kittle is a behavioural reaction that is similar to rats and humans.
Catastrophe Disposed: Great fire deleted in French chemistry
The large fire in a chemical plant, which is particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen, has been deleted. This told the prefecture of the Normandy of the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire was burst in the night until Thursday.
According to public authorities, no health hazardous substances should be withdrawn. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the incident. The firearm was employed with about 200 deletion vehicles.
Schools and children's gardens have been closed
Residents were called not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and children's gardens stayed closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in Parliament after revoking the compulsory break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU without agreements on 31 October should not respond to Brussels's requests for amendments to the Brexit Agreement, but as he wants to achieve this, it is unclear.
The Prime Minister said about Cox, who used to stay in the European Union in the United Kingdom: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's thinking and to re-establish this country would have been to carry out the EU exit." Cox had been murdered by a legal extremist during the referendum fight in 2016.
Mahnmal to attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a monument will be revealed in Norway on Saturday to honor the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of some 1,000 iron rose reproductions. They recall the roses that had been deposited by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Dom in Oslo.
The same place is now to reveal the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. It is expected to open among other Kronprinz Haakon and Kronprinses Mette-Marit.
On 22 July 2011, the legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first fired a car bomb in Oslo's government district and subsequently shot dozen participants of a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Labour Party. In total 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN general debate did not resolve the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Immpero" held in Iran could steal back into sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iran's President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Stena Bulk shipping company reported.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now drive for medical investigations to Dubai, said Reedereichef Erik Hånell. By noon, the ship left the Iranian waters. "Beautiful that it's over," he said to Swedish television station SVT.
The Foreign Ministry in London referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a model of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain the ship and international law," said a communication on Friday.
On 19 July, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker under the accusation to have misconducted rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They would have acted professionally in the face of the difficult and ripening situation in the past ten weeks. The shipowner is now working to bring them together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected that after the "Stena Impero" definition, a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar was placed on the chain in Iran at the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been intended for Syria. According to the authorities, the supply was violated against EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The ship had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Measurements, it was a exchange business to release the "Stena Impero", as London vehement back.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world's oil export is shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have been enormously sharpened over the past few months. Trade ships have been moved into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There were several incidents with tankers and drones.
Under the tensions between Teheran and Washington, the nuclear conflict of both countries stands. The Americans propose the Iranian leadership to want to build nuclear weapons. Iran declines this. In 2018, the US had rose out of the international nuclear agreement, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put the leadership in Teheran under pressure with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter and expanded agreement. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the USA is working on a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the street of Hormus at the UN Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protection forces, wants to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is developing a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war winner". In view of the penal duties imposed by the US President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to redispose. Finance chiefs of Asian companies considering to put their production from China to another country, call India in a survey of the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This has, of course, not only to do with the inconveniences of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pole of young workers and a internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be a more important role in the globally branched production chain.
But now India itself has been in Trump's focus. From the Haudegen in the White House depreciatingly called "Kingdom of Customs", America has withdrawn from the emerging country at the beginning of June the trade advantages for 2000 products. The United States claims India prohibitively high duties and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and others.
On the world map of trade wars, the rivalry with India is of course a side view. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's power claims in the South Indian Ocean. In this context, an American salve must be unlikely to oppose India. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term of office, should therefore be in security.
However, the problem lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a severe stand in the socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. Its reform zeal is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic error, which has been embroidered in the multi-popular state for too long any entrepreneurial spirit. Companies now receive faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more aggressive insolvency and bankrupt law creates conditions for liquidating seeming companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In India, economic optics has turned much to better in the first five modes years. However, this is not true in trade policy. The national conservative government even created new barriers to protecting companies from foreign suppliers from internationally less competitive.
In the West, the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who renews its country economically radically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows all too well what vocabulary western managers like. But in the core of the "India First" advocate was never deprived of a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to dispose of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Business people surviving thanks to the abolition of their industries are among the main selectors of Modi nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and complain this short-looking policy.
Replacement of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac is to be confiscated in Paris the next week. The former Head of State will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, reports the news agency AFP on the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the narrow family circle. On Sunday a public celebration was held in the Paris invalidity, as media reported.
The competitors wore to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Light Athletics World Cup
The world’s peak was long in the goal when the cooled Khalifa International Stadium played heartwarming scenes. In the first advance of the men over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby started to swallow from Aruba. He could hardly keep 300 meters in front of the target, ran in unhealthy attitude when Braima Suncar Dabo from the western African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly undershook him and put him back the last half stage to the destination. However, the forces were still enough to stop the running bracelet watch after the finish. As if the scene had not already been curios enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he had quite unexpectedly attracted the attention of the gathered journalists. It was just ashamed that he wouldn't want to talk about his hero's deed at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only one suffering fellow. And yet he would be just proud to represent his country, which was invited by the World Association for the World Cup. In normal circumstances, he would not even have started. "I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this with emphasis on the evening - and much more intense than he would have thought of it. For this hero's act will be remembered. Zumal Dabo even left his competitor Busby the precedent in the goal and voluntarily took the last place - well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this advance. It had nothing to do at the end, because the busby came to the goal with much help was disqualified precisely for that to the end of the World Light Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, was approached to set up a personal best time at the Doha World Cup, according to official data at 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millions: Egyptians are ready for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been reinforced in advance of possible government critic protests. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir platform were locked.
In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to protests. Hundreds were arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, protested with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, accusing critic corruption and mismanagement. There has been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian operator and actor Mohammed Ali, who put the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called a "Million Marsch" in central places in the country for today's Friday. Ali demands a "Volksrevolution". The man is also not a "Guter for most young Egyptians, because he is a subcontractor for the army millions, but he arrives for his messages.
According to two observers groups, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had increased more than 1.570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures were not confirmed. The government also confirmed and commented the figures.
arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "willingly arrested", "only because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time', HRW told arrestors on appeal to lawyers. The accusations against the arrested people range from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association" according to their lawyers. In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, and searched security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW statements also arbitrary passers.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government blocks in Cairo websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: Shipping dealers should be able to spend return more easily
For online retailers, a lot of items that have been returned are lost. About 20 million returnes land on the waste. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate back-mailed products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be liberated from the turnover tax on contributions, the Ministry explained on a question of the Green-Bundestagsfraction, on which the newspapers of the Radio Media Group reported on Friday. However, dealers could use the market value of the unrecommended returnes so low that they would not have to pay any or just a few turnover taxes.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg have determined that the German citizens would return each sixth package in orders on the Internet. Some four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then landed in the waste. They would additionally cost the companies according to current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate the amount of donations such as turnover, which then applies to turnover taxes.
Green-Fraction Chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Ministers of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decision that companies cannot evaluate non-profit products accordingly and donate freely to non-profit organisations. The companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This is not only valid for online trade but also for other shops from the fashion shop to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underscores "the reconstruction of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic attitude of animals and tribes". From Saturday the painting at Sotheby's in the British capital will be exhibited until it will be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated to be 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29th. On this occasion, the work called "Fragestunde" was renamed to "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million.
Lastly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard exchange with the opposition at the first meeting of the suburb after a compulsory break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit that has already been postponed twice on 31 October, if necessary without agreements with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes with the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture representing a man that breaks a star of the European flag with a Meißel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors daily on the entrance to the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "Space in the Park"
The fierce verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top advisor. The current controversy is a "spaziergang in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy this. We will exit (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the last few days and, among other things, called "treatment" to the people. Announcements that he could put the MEPs at risk because they could become a target of murder threats, he dealt as "Humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to leave rest is if the Members would finally respect the British decision to withdraw from the EU, and it is not surprising that the people are upset about the fact that Britain has not yet left the EU three years after the referendum.
Even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for retention on Friday. "We should talk with respect," said a statement. "And we should listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, once again asked the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the Uno Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear forces of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. "If this is going bad, one hopes for the best, but is prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kaschmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial domination in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers dominate part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn autonomy status from the Indian Kashmir region, thus increasing tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the fall of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It makes the population shoot with a sharp ammunition, more than 2000 arrested in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who already sit there. Protesting in Egypt has never been dangerous. However, since the power of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario like at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspectivelessness and the feeling of being embroidered by its own government driven millions on the road. And this is a problem that does not get the regime of el-Sisi, no matter how hard it is against counterparts. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, each third lives under the poverty limit in Egypt. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also for the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stages, produces food and much more. This was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critical it will always be when large parts of the population have difficult to do a bottle of water at all.
Tüv Tests in Terminal: BER-Chef: No "Showstoper" for Capital Airport
Two months has been examined whether the complex plant flecht works in the BER-Brandschutz team. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not ready at the BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the future capital airport terminal, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is safe, said Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control board.
The airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful test, but also said that there were still defects in the terminal. "We have many detail topics, but we don't have a real show stop." He assured that the timetable until commissioning still contains buffer.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reserve is no longer too large. The construction production indicator is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year it was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of lack of power cables are still to be resolved; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for entering the flight operation, it is still necessary to work intensively on the processing of defects," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is no release for all the droughts to which the cable tracks hang. The airport chief expects it to be available until the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal still does not work satisfactory. The problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking cutting down at a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They are going too far down. 36 engines must therefore be exchanged. Then, at the beginning of the year, there are new attempts with hot gas smoking.
Problems with fire protection and other tree defects as well as planning errors delay the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was expected to operate in 2011. Since the beginning of 2006, the cost increased from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros for opening the next year.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have risen significantly since, the controllers plan to expand the airport. Therefore, a special meeting of the Supervisory Board will take place on 18 October, as the President of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial Chief Heike Fölster switches to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Staff Chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen retires next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Automates for Drugs - Police arrests
He needed money for drugs - and he was chasing several automates in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator finally sits in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of sprinkled cigarette and parking bill carmates in Chemnitz and the region has risen strongly. It has been a million damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police took a 33-year-old German on the civil road and on the further road in Chemnitz.
Police speaker Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations on the introduction of explosive explosions in action unit with particularly severe case of theft led by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, not only confirmed this suspicion against the 33-year-olds."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer was now a total of eight acts.
The police speaker: "With the prey, he apparently funded his defence dependency." Only four times, between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomber had sprinkled cars on the civil road.
The total damage caused amounts to at least EUR 60 000!
The automated bomb is now under investigation, and the police investigations against him are continuing.
It can be imagined that he was also responsible for further automated spreads in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is turning its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the middle of the pricing struggle with cheap airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa daughter AUA "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna" confirmed a press speaker of Austrian Airlines to the APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa-Billigflyer Eurowings is de facto dissolved. From the current seven Eurowings aircraft remain four in Vienna. This AUA takes over from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg, three Eurowings-Jets will be stationed in the future, which are intended to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AAUA cross and network planning, the speaker said. The flight times should be tailored to connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the turning cross of Vienna and, on the other hand, to expand decentralized traffic from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, the Eurowings in Vienna are only used as a "Production Company" for the AUA group sisters. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight managers are from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights launched under AUA flight number are according to the report no longer in terminal 1, but as the AUA in terminal 3.
After the Niki flight, a prize struggle broke out at Vienna Airport. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced that the fleet in Vienna would increase to 16 planes next summer. The Irish Billigflyer sends four Ryanair Machines, along with Crews, to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which criticized the trade union as a violation of the collective contract.
The fighting announcement by Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overwhelmed the AUA in five years, replied on Friday AUA boardlor Andreas Otto: "We stay the number one at the location, in five, six or ten years".
Queen Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) should have stopped around the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are delighted to be able to announce our engagement. We both are so delighted to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be married in fact," said the British media reports in the official communication.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us in the coming years full of love and happiness."

However, it is sure that the number nine of the British throne and the real estate mogoule becomes a celebration similar to the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what does a heart weakness or an attack really trigger? Hamburg researchers now want to look at the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to trace more detailed the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) informed on Friday. The Kühne Foundation promotes the project with 12,5 million euros. From Switzerland are the High Mountains Hospital Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the essential influential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known. Now the scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients in the UKE University of Heart and Vegetation.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease caused changes of DNA - so-called mutations - were known, it was said by the clinic. Every year about 200 would come.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac rhythm disorders, heart weaknesses and heart attacks. The data could also benefit from the research of other folk diseases, such as Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University of Heart and Containment Centre. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer are possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a strong will to use the data for research of other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos has so far treated allergies. Now, at the medical camp there, a center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created and a professorship for bioinformatics. To explain his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur in Switzerland said that he had been operated in the open heart of Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The bio samples of healthy participants are from Hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 volunteers, according to the clinic, this is the world's largest local health study. During the heritage encryption, strictly respected the protection of anonymous data, the scientists assured. It is a petabyte (1000 terabyte) on data, said Holger Moch from the University of Zurich.
According to UKE, a human heritage can be decrypted today within 24 hours. The pure cost of the property is 1300 euros. The first gene sequence worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study will begin on 1 October, all 9000 samples will be analysed at the end of 2020, and the first results will be expected in the following year.
Nigerian police free hundreds of maltreated boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to the evidence of residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims who were still minor, as police speaker Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them indicated that they were raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys were held under the pretext, being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the guards were held by their teachers under "deceptive and most inhuman" conditions, Sabo said. Some a hundred students, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small room.
According to the Qur'an School, residents had been aware of repeated irregularities in the institution for about ten years. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the state of the Qur'an school, Sabo said. They would have not responded to the sufferings of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the most Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often lacking state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed bands. According to the UN Refugee Fund, more than 40,000 people fled over the border in the neighbouring state of Niger over the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
Policemen in a school in northern Nigeria have released nearly 400 students from horrible conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police speaker Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
There the children had been discovered in a Islamic school on Thursday, where the conditions were "human unworthy". The officials arrested the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, including boys, were kept in their school like slaves and were placed in chains. Some were sexually abused. TV images showed poor and injured pupils in an apparently bad health condition.
World Football Selection: Further Announcements by Messis and Klopps
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa marks the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honour and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted at the World Footballer's election, other countries come announcement to the Fifa. Egypt was not appreciated at all - with a curious justification.
In recent years, much of the fifa has proved incredible: the World Cup grants, the dubiose plans of their President Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt functionaries. The Fifa World Footballer's election has not yet been suspicious to run unclean - if one rejects that the voted national trainers and national team captains of the member associations often voted for sympathy rather than for objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, there are further inconveniences: Egypt complains that the votes of National Trainers Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible summary of votes.
The fifa apologizes that "the signatures on the choice forms were issued in uppercase letters and were therefore not valid". The Egyptian Association has been contacted several times in order to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's Trainer also amazed
There is also a cry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is perceived, the Sudanese association states that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally appreciated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. However, Fifa said that the vote had taken the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera also raised: "Don't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details of my voice are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan football association has just voted in his name.
From the Association came the message on Friday: voted, but of course was not intent. The filled election documents were "unwittingly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, said it in a communication of the Association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually chosen. "We assume the responsibility for the administrative error," said it. Both Rosas and manship trainer Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "also as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases now allow the fifa to examine in an investigation, but emphasize that the election process was externally supervised by the advisory company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains uncontroversial winners of the World Footballer Wall - and Jürgen Klop World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine affairs: Ranghohe Republicaner expresses itself for official investigation
Two rank-high Republicans have spoken openly for an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where that is from here it is determined by the facts that are found". He wants to know more about the Whistleblower office before taking measures. An impeachment procedure can lead to the postponement of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the revealings, which showed that Trump had repeatedly asked the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to examine the activities of the democratic president and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott observed Trump Biden "since years".
To date, the Republicans have refrained from criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower affairs, only few have shown discomfort. Scott's comments are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already reversed several times against Trump's policy, such as the elimination of environmental legislation and the strengthening of immigration rules.
As another ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the convention is now to investigate the matter and go to the ground."
Scott and Baker, governor of the U.S. states, have formally not spoken in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided at the Congress. Therefore, their statements are especially symbolic. Nevertheless, first senators of the Republicans also expressed critically about the situation. With Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing".
The affairs could be in the introduction of an official anti-dumping procedure against Trump, the democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation. They suggest to him power abuse for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefits.
There is no exact timetable for the procedure for retirement of office. With its majority in the House of Representatives, democrats could endeavoure a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual official inquiry fell in the Senate where Trump's Republicaners have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. No US president has yet been exposed by an impedance procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily and have been raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had unauthorized the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Lybian refugees on board. After severe protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was revoked by an Italian judge after a few days.
Now new heavy accusations against racket are being loud. Thus, three men who are provoked torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been taken in a recording camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had re-established their tortures in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but do not have any secure information about it," said "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben Neugebauer der Deutschen Presse-Agentur.
In mid-September, the police said that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically shaken and brutally exposed – through repeated and constant physical violence," said the notice.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. Therefore it is very likely that there are also offenders on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed."
Italy's former Minister for Immigration, Matteo Salvini, asked Rackete immediately to apologize against which aid for illegal immigration was still found in Italy.
Musk aims at delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company with the view of new record numbers strongly driven on the stock exchange.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliverys," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks Rundschreiben. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customership. To this end Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked that: Teslas shares went out of trade with a plus of over six percent. So strongly, the course has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered more than 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be made in the current and coming quarter of the year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
US-Budgetry: Once again only a bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in the expenditure ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States have once again reached the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October without expenditure plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided to finance the transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, it would have come to a shutdown on Monday midnight, a partial conclusion of the Federal Government. President Trump has to enter into force the decision.
Shutdown turned off
The Federal Government will now be financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 which will end on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 expenditure laws, which will assign the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Government cannot first of all benefit from the budget for the new financial year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio.
The democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the expenditure laws reflect the priorities of the democrats, which have little chances in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. In turn, the Senate also has ten of the twelve expenditure plans more or less prepared, which are hardly multiplicable.
In the Senate, the Republicans are obviously trying to force $12 billion for wall construction, one of the great priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are disturbing the plans of the walls and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute on wall construction was escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the building of the wall, the spirits separate themselves
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement with all twelve expenditure laws over the next seven weeks, an extension of transitional financing is beyond 21 November, and a shutdown is not excluded.
In the light of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve expenditure laws in time, and the risk of shutdown, which is associated with it, gains ideas to automate the process of popularity. Template S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the financing of the Federal Government would automatically continue at the previous year level, prevent the travel activities of Parliamentaries and retain their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are presented.
France allows artificial fertility for reading and singles
In France, artificial fertility is to be open to women and lesbians in the future: The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government's legislative document, which allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which would significantly increase the demand for anonymous seed donations.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that many "children without father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the renewal.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that defended health minister Agnès Buzyn as a "chance" for society. It represents the modern family in which children with only one parent or with homosexual parents are given. According to them, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women is to be borne by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm by dead husband further forbidden
The National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an amendment which would give widows access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial fertilization of "post-mortem" is permitted. In Germany, in the past, there were cases where women were in vain for the release of the sperm of a deceased man. The opponents of the incident in Paris argued that a so-bezeuged child would bear a "severely heavy fate".
On the other hand, numerous members of the Government Party La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and opposition members had spoken for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow was "double grief" imposed if her husband was still unfulfilled by her child's death.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unjust that a widow can be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner in the future.
To date, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that the nursery was still banned.
In Germany artificial fertility is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples it is often difficult.
Compensation payment for climate: calls for flight charges for unis become clearer
There is a lot of flights to the universities. Therefore, the country wants to have a climate tax in the future, and the rectors say they don't have money for it, but now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also be limited to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on a climate issue on universities and universities flights before the summer break comes back in the vibration. After the national rectors conference had sceptically responded to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctorates of six bath-worth-temberg universities and a Pedagogue University for a compensation of service flights are calling for a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, it is said in their opinion. The originally planned cabinet decision is therefore on ice because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the greens.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the arrested fishermen were supposed to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. At that time there was a change of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered his severe injuries. This time, however, there were no injuries, said it.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food deficiency. The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian high-risk waters. Russia's coastal guard drives, according to its own information, to protect its marine biological resources patrols.
30,000 ink fish confiscated
30,000 ink fish were discovered and confiscated on the boats during the re-checks and three fishermen and two motorboats were confiscated and brought to Naodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's fishing authorities had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year after complaints of local entrepreneurs. According to thousands of fishermen from North Korea, the media have already been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries companies in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with closely synthetic networks banned in Russia. With these small living creatures would also get out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
Next only 18.000: United States decreases asylum upper boundary
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is deteriorating against protective seekers: As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington confirms, the ceiling for legal refugees' entry will continue to be lowered. The next is to receive mostly threatened believers and Iraqi asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low border for the inclusion of new refugees once again. In the financial year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, up to 18,000 people are to be left into the country, as the US Foreign Ministry said. In the nearly overseas marketing year, the limit is still at 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the reception of protective seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, far higher levels of reception have been applied.
The estimated ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the US as "the most generous and generous nation in history", a formulation which strongly reminds of the language use of the official US president.
"Responsible dealings" with refugees aimed at returning refugees to their home countries to help reconstruction there, said Trump. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives much encouragement from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border to Mexico, which Trump wants to lock. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump has imposed national emergency. Whether there is a temporary connection between the current action and the current domestic developments in the US capital, Trump is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially threatening procedure for reconciliation.
The U.S. government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqians who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as the Declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows. However, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be included from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "normal triangle" of Central America apply for asylum in other countries. In this context, the United States have only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to reduce migration at the US-south border to Mexico.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An orang-Utan female has been transferred to a capture station for human affairs in the United States at the request of the Argentine jurisdiction from the former zoo of Buenos Aires. The "Sandra" born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986 was granted the rights of a "non-human person" because its release was forced. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight, but not as a passenger, but in the freight room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human affairs are not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, it will live in the free hike of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 shimpannes, among them "Bubbles", formerly pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before the entry into Florida, "Sandra" has to endure an approximately 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" in 2014 has contributed to the conversion of Buenos Aires' zoo to an ecopark. A research and educational site for the conservation of biodiversity is to be created there until 2023.
Record for Swiss extreme mountain climber: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountain climber Dani Arnold has succeeded a new Husarenrit at the nearly 3000 metres high Great Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without network, double soil or other aids, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Zinne in a new record time.
Clothed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus, he underwent the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Regardless of the trade conflict with China, the US sports goods manufacturer Nike has made a significant profit surplus. Net profit rose in the past quarter to $1.4 billion (approximately EUR 1.3 billion). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year period, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is especially the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor turns directly to its customers.
The turnover increased to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August. Nike sales figures increased by an added of 22 percent in China, thus profiting from Beaverton in the U.S. state of Oregon from its approach to direct the consumer via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial Chief Andy Campion announced that Nike, with strategic investments, would continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer and thus increase its competitive advantage. The investors responded to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus from AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been polluted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialalasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Pride to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who played with AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted late Thursday. He reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma trailers should never visit a game of the club again, wrote the club on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian soccer. Regularly Italian fans scan racist malignations against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The occasion of the statement were racist songs at the firstliga party between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florenz on the previous Sunday.
However, there had recently been discussions about the adherents of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now proved 38 Randal fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them should no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed. Accordingly, for the rest, the bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are connected with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra-Fan Groups in the area of Juventus. The twelve are challenged, among other things, severe expression, money laundering and private violence. The club had taken the investigations with an advertisement last year.
The ultra-leaders are supposed to be "militaryly controlled" by Italian media reports behind the black trade with tickets. They would have been "militaryly controlled" tickets for the fancurve and have forced Juventus employees to get cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennials are narcissical, generation Z is political - whole years are devised with delicate names. See more precisely, the awards are full of contradictions. How well do these labels describe the respective feeling of life of young people?
"The crabs come!" On September 21, this call officially launched the crab catch at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, whereby the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival was announced as the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee department announced.
Gaochun, which forms the southern runner of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions in ecological terms with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, people in Gaochun have started crab farming. In the course of the time, the crab industry has developed into a striking sector, which ensured high income and became an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years Gaochun has actively endeavored to a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as a technically based crab farming. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has promoted a reform on the distribution of power, optimization of administration and public administration services, with care to build the service network for "approvals under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for credit granting". Thus, the city wants to optimize the environment for approvals, services and development.
Gaochun fully exploits the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a sign to set up intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health sectors, and ecological farms leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all areas of tourism and tourism of national importance. Gaochun's ecological and cultural resources have been involved in the landscape of Gaochun, the state of the buildings for civil service and public service, the areas of "Tourism +" and "+ tourism", and the development of cultural tourism to a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer from the United States to withdraw sanctions. In return, the United States had put an end to all sanctions for discussions with the Teheran leadership, explained Ruhani on its official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian officer on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had forced a meeting to take place. "And America says I lift the penalties," added Ruhani. The kind of penalty measures that should be completed have stood for the debate. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions."
However, this incident was not acceptable, criticized Ruhani. In view of the current criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure" no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with US president Donald Trump, like Merkel on the edge of the UN Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 descendants
After western Turkey was shocked by two earthquakes within the shortest time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured at the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the phenomenon in the previous day there have been nearly 200 retreats, the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This increases the concern for a catastrophe.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. On Thursday, the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropolises. Now the government wanted to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
During the last 20 years, Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for shaking, Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the late danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built housings are crashed - among other things, murmured by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shaken Istanbul.
For years, city planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have warned that large open areas, which were registered in the centre as refugees, have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of Gölcük in August, Istanbul's building engineer chamber had warned that an estimated million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of the earthquake of Thursday was located in Marmarameer in the Silivri District and in about seven kilometres of depth, as the Afad Disaster Protection Authority reported. A smaller post-shake caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu notified on Twitter, injured or damage had not been reported at first. Staatssender TRT showed people who ran panic from the houses. Students were brought out of the buildings for security reasons in the district of Silivri. Some students wept as they had seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly dangerous. Under the marmarameer is a section of the so-called North Anatolic disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most fatal was the quake in 1999 near Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of thickness may threaten 7.1 to 7.4. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. At the earthquake on Thursday it already met the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have completed so-called Go-Bags with all the necessities being packed next doors, and schools teach children how to conduct when the earth wakes. When the next big shake comes, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu pursued the developments of the Istanbul Catastrophic Coordination Centre (Akom). Accordingly, two minarettes of mosques crashed into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of retirement in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings wackeled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines were interrupted. It was more severe than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Moon, Kerem Klinik, warned about Twitter for retirement. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to the time of the quake, official data are given at 13.59 p.m. (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a precipitation that was indicated with a thickness of 4.0 on the Judge scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of thickness 4.6 shaken the Turkish marmara region - it was to feel until Istanbul. Also its epicentre was located in the Marmarameer west of the million metropolis, the Afad Civil Protection Authority already informed on Tuesday.
It wasn't the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there might be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually cause damage - and massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It had become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to the sender. "In the past or later, the great quake will also come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the shaking also caused great concerns in Istanbul. Moreover, in Albania there had only been a fierce earthquake a few days ago - there were 68 injured people. Also at the lake of the ground this year, the earth had poured.
Parliament: New ignorance in Ukraine
Two brilliant documents provide for new ignorance in Ukraine's affairs for potential abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible procedure of official inquiry, the US democracies are strengthened: The complaint about Trump and its controversial telephoneat with the Ukrainian president is a key point for investigations against the President. Trump itself sees itself more than the victims of a "hexe hunting". He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
United States: United Airlines air passenger locked in toilet - airplane redirected
Because a passenger had been locked in the board toilette, a flight has been redirected from United Airlines. The WC door had been blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline was informed according to US media.
At an out-planned intermediate landing in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time) the woman was finally released from the narrow cabin. About an hour they had been imprisoned in it, U.S. media wrote to other passengers. For further flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to switch the machine.
In a video spread on the Internet, which, according to US media, is supposed to come from flight 1554, is to see how several people try to liberate the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We'll soon get you out, okay?" says a man. The airline apologized at all passengers. Open was first if the woman received a compensation.
The Cakerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous narrative "The Conversion", British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book on the Brexit Chaos in Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on 27 November, the Diogenes Publisher (Zurich). In this it is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but now is the most powerful man of the UK. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people in action and is determined to be held up by nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment when ministers lie as the Soviet leaders once, when Brexiteans in high positions are right to give up the catastrophe of a No-Deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write". By McEwan, only in the spring of the novel "Mashines like I" appeared on artificial intelligence.
The first story published by Kafkas in 1915 is by Gregor Samsa, who is awake one morning and sees himself "as an immense scatter" and is gradually excluded from family and society and finally goes underground. "Ian McEwan is necessarily necessarily in front of Kafka to describe a world that stands the head," said the Diogenic publisher.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austrian railway infrastructure
11.200 cars in Austria and Hungary receive fleeting brakes to reduce noise load by freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna's New Town and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
According to EU authorities, this aims to make travels more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds are from the EU infrastructure pitch "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels canceled until 31 October
The German travel organiser Thomas Cook has canceled all the trips a day after his insolvency contract until 31 October 2019. Travel could not be "insolvency-law" for reasons", the company informed on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travels, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Travels and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As it stands for travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further approach was examined.
Thomas Cook in Germany was joined by the British Mother Group's pledge and had made an insolvency application on Wednesday. The company, among which Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Bucher travels, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer hotels immediately again money
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels in the abroad who currently host Thomas-Cook holidays will receive money from the Zurich insurance. Payments to the hotels are linked according to Zurich to the condition that holidayers are no longer asked for extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without submission of separate invoices, hotels in the resorts are now expected to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as one Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and with the condition that Thomas-Cook travellers from these hotels will not be prompted for individual payment of hotel accounts or otherwise required," said Sprecher Bernd Engelien.
Insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay their accommodation on site themselves. Some therefore had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had criticized this sharply.
How many hotels are affected, the insolvent travel provider will be voted on Friday, said the insurance speaker. According to the Thursday, 70 000 Thomas-Cook-payers were travelling from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured holidays and returning the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by the Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are still on the way. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly in the holiday, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening the company informed that all travels would be canceled until 31 October. This is also true for such bookings that have already been paid.
As it stands for travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In line with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined. In principle, the insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the Kaera company. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about possibilities of returning the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry Destroyed Sprengmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry continues the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa, he now walks directly on the traces of his mother.
The British Prince Harry was clothed with a blue splitter vest in Angola and destroyed a spring mine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trusts at the town of Dirico on Friday morning before running TV cameras he created the ignition circle. In a safe distance, the sponge bodies exploded in the Savanne landscape, without any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields threatening the population.
On the fifth day of his journey in Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same sponsor who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to relocate the way she went at that time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious minefield in 1997 were around the world. She also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day journey in Africa that has begun in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town since Monday.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The risk of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly defined that there will be no guarantee of a third withdrawal of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are in the polarising British of eternity? The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain sweves like a damocle difficulty over the Blondhead. Its suspension of Parliament to carry out its Brexit course until the date of departure was canceled at the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral discussions in the event of failed negotiations with the EU until 31 October. However, this had always been ruled categorically by Johnson.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass to Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he made an indication that he supported an extension of the negotiations by the end of October in the event of a non-compliance:
You know, we'll comply with the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that this works.
And the time is gradually running away from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. Some six weeks later, the EU and the British retailers have time to prevent the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union without agreements. However, the recent discussions have not yet achieved a breakthrough again. A agreement until the end of October appears more difficult to imagine. The British Prime Minister does not break the law, there is a renewal of the date of withdrawal. However, the opposition does not hold the words of the Prime Minister. It fears that Johnson could, in the event of a No-Dealing the Brexit.
U.S. authorities: Other deaths caused by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of E-cigarettes in the USA has increased to twelve. In addition, 805 confirmed and likely injured in this context, the US Health Authority informed CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine" there were already more than 900 affected people, around 500 of them. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage is known in Europe so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
The fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Mohammed Ali's videos were divided millions of times in online networks. The Spanish builder and actor demands a "Volksrevolution". For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which accuses critics of corruption and misconduct. Ali hopes for mass convictions with a million participants at central places in the country.
In any event, security authorities are alarmed. In the center of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir platform were locked. In recent days the police had strengthened their road controls and partially searched for pedestrian phones for news and photos related to protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir site.
Over the past weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there had been protests with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), the security forces responded hardly. Since last week, almost 2,000 people were arrested. Many of them were arbitraryly arrested - only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW was communicated under appeal to lawyers arresters.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government blocks in Cairo websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he had crashed the democraticly chosen Islamist President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of government, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs by Greenland expedition back
The Polar Researcher Arved Fuchs returned from its Greenland expedition on Friday. He was welcomed on his arrival in the port of Hamburg, among other things, by the Skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg over the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has examined and documented the consequences of warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future Movement is a blessing, said the Polar Researcher. For years he had waited for the young generation to speak. For decades, one knows that the earth warms up. Yet many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of the warming up and the confusion of the seas. Among other things, the expedition was measured by a drone greenlands glacier trip and was fished by networks for microplastics.
The Polar Researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "Seadevcon Award for a Sustainable and Respectful Use of the World Seas" in the context of the Hamburger Climate Week. "For all of us who are at the heart of the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have been made in the Arctic in recent decades."
Dear Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for nodles 430 Euro
430 Euro for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Englishburg in Rome: this seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. Included invoice with 80 euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the closure to Facebook, which caused hot reactions.
"Some cases harm Rome's reputation. We call on the police to examine whether this is a fraud," demanded a speaker from Federagit, the association of travellers in Rome according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messaggero (Freitagsausgabe).
Prompt came to the reaction of the restaurant owners. The Japanese had ordered not only Spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be taken from the invoice. A drinking fee of up to 20 percent of the invoice is also normal, said the host.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could, after the turbulent revealings of the past days, actually face an official refusal procedure, the democrats want to examine this with their investigation at the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is from weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephone is supposed to be public with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of whistleblower, who finally brought the conversation to the public with his complaint from concern about national security and democracy, is monstrous: The president has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for influence on the election of 2020. He has exploited Ukraine's dependency in this process and thus forced them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also reflected in the now published coupon of the conversation with Selenskyj, even though it does not reflect the complete text. However, the 25th of July is only an episode of a much larger history, in which its center next to Trump is primarily its personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes its beginning from the view of the public in May 2019, when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans report to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very precisely that his intentions are delicate. "We don't mix ourselves into a choice, we mix ourselves into an investigation for what we have the right," he says the newspaper. You might think it's inappropriate, but "there's nothing illegal". Giuliani wants to pursue investigations in Ukraine for which there is hardly a basis - "because these information will be very, very helpful for my clients and could prove to be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former Mayor of New York seems to have infected itself with right conspiracy fantasia fixed on Trump's counter-kandidat at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspirated with actors in Ukraine, critics at the time said to construct an occasion for Russia's investigations in the USA. However, this accusation was never taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigations about which Trump will speak so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giulianis and the President is: The former Vice-President and presently prospective candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, had, as the Ukraine officer of the Obama Government, urged Wiktor Schokin to release the then Ukrainian General Prosecutor. To stop the investigation of the gas company responsible by him, in whose supervision board his son Hunter Biden worked.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian prosecutor-general should go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Schokin was also provoked very deeply corrupt gestures, and the US government was far from the only Western partner who urged his release. Moreover, the Obama government expressly supported investigations against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions at Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, Germany, the UK and Spain are particularly affected. On the website all disturbances.de users report that Facebook has not always been charged since about 15.30 p.m. Also Instagram reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disturbance, even if not in the same range.
Instagram and co. more often affected by disorders
It's not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, the services had fallen out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also use Twitter this time especially to make their anger air.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been saved from the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were travelling with a hose boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in the calamity - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue screwer for the storage.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean air brigade:
"By 9:30 a.m. we received the message, just 10 a.m. we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the hoseboat."
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station , 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers have certainly been brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NOT load wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Lastly, as several new smartphones have come to the market, which support and sell themselves very well - all ahead of the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the univerity of Warwick's findings, this is extremely harmful to the devices. For this reason, the significantly larger heat development is. If you are charged a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. On the other hand, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees at perfect orientation of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the cell phone is somewhat next to the spine, the temperature increases even higher. In addition, the Watt strength of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives the power consumption to high.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor. Each degree plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery not only reduces capacity, but also does not last so long. Thus, the lifespan is lower. Therefore, the researchers recommend that the smartphone always be charged by cable. Since a battery exchange is always connected with high costs for modern smartphones, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of an battery exchange even again - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely comfortable: simply put the device on an appropriate charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is unleashed cable salad and tired plug fumlei. Since Qi (is for inductive energy transfer) uses a global standard, with exceptionally Apple, there are little restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Nepalesian mountain climber has, according to its own information, reached 13 of the world's 14 highest mountains within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, informing his expedition organiser.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight thousand people in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He already made international headlines: A photo of mountain climbers on Mount Everest Snake, which came from him in spring.
The image of the mass and ran a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest summit of the earth. In May, eleven climbers died at the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th thousand: Chinese authorities are currently locking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. Among other things, it is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a powerful elephant cow, a police speaker informed on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police speaker, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers in whose land the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This usually happens when the animals move through their habitats.
According to estimates in Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants live. Theoretically, the death penalty stands on their killing.
Maintained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas, more than two months after its arrest by Iran. This was announced by the Bandar Abbas Maritime Office, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the tanker travelling under British flag on 19 July under the accusation to have disregarded the rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Critics
The responsible economic committee of the sub-house wants to examine the pledge of the traveller Thomas Cook. It is intended to cover the salary packages of the Executive Board as well as the question of why the British government did not have to contribute financially to the survival companies. "Our interest is to supervise in the company as well as to control by external accountants," said the Committee president Rachel Reeves in London. "Of course we have to do with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of genes in the increased family risk of intestinal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. According to this conclusion, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg have come in a current study. Other risk factors such as family nutrition habits are likely to be more serious than before. This has consequences for calculating individual intestinal cancer, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk increases Tesla shares
This was written by Musk in a email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to rapidly bring the cars to the sponsorship, with the need to offer Tesla as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Teslas shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered more than 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver up to 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be made in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Will British Government deal with Brexit Law? Johnson reluctant
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson deals with whether he is looking for an unregulated Brexit on the basis of the possibility of a violation of the last law adopted by Parliament. On a question he just said on Friday before journalists that his government would comply with the applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the date of withdrawal should not have been reached agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "Capitalisation Act" which is difficult to negotiate with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political trembling" to avoid the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that shifts the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said he strives for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Iran seems to drive high uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on European contract partners in the conflict about the rescue of the historical nuclear agreement. "Leider the European States show inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the edge of the United Nations Assembly in New York. In case they do not stand to their promises, he gave "more steps" away from the agreements of the 2015 hardly negotiated agreement.
Background is the conflict between the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, as a counterpart, contained the commitment to normalize economic relations to Teheran. The US rose from the agreement in 2018 alone to force Iran with a "maximal pressure" to a course change in the aggressively considered Middle East policy. The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with stronger charges and is now re-establishing severe sanctions against Teheran. Iran reacted lastly with a resume of the uranan-riching restricted in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses the centralifugen installed at the beginning of September with uranium or at least prepared for use. Iran also prepares the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges according to IAEA.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians with the costs and the burden of US sanctions alone, thought Rohani. However, there will still be further discussions that hopefully breach a solution.
Rohani continues to dispute Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the quantity has changed: Germany, France and Great Britain followed the US assessment that Teheran is responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran in Yemen were aware of the attack, but what the USA considered as a false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such accusations must provide evidence for this," said Rohani. However, that would not have been the case for the European leaders in the discussions with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would only have called on the rebels in Yemen to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met in recent days with Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible conversations with U.S. President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the U.S. administration had to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He urged the government in Washington to reverse a policy of "dialogion and reason".
Comet of other star crossed Sun System
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the deep of the world. This has only been achieved before. The comet allows conclusions on other solar systems.
What was at first only a suspicion is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized to 2I/Borisov after its discovery and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The wider comet was discovered on August 30th by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters diameter. Following observations of various observers confirmed not only that it was an unknown comet, but also that it was not from our solar system.
After 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object that has been seen on a flight of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get insights into a foreign solar system from the area before it disappears on re-establishment. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canaries. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is clearly above this distance above the typical speeds of objects that circle the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Authority in a message.
According to the comet, the analysis is on a so-called hyperbel track that leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honour of his discoverer, the interstellar swift star, which was initially led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, received the name 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name showing that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in flight. Thus, the researchers will stay for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," explained Farnocchia. "Then it will only be seen by October 2020 with larger professional telescopes."
Several observers have already taken the sight of the visitor. Thus, a team of Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already guided the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the sky object at 2 to 16 kilometres. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear float of the comet.
Researchers from the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar swift star that offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of comets of our solar system, and that indicates that its composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets could form themselves in other solar systems through similar processes as in ours, supplemented the León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to investigate certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such stippvisites are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors might have a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
The Agency wants to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres from the earth (e.g. comet-seat hunters) until 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is supposed to wait on a still unattended, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the People's People's Republic, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines is landed at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be made annually at the new airport, and in 2025 they are already 72 million. China's president Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's latest prestige project is also called "Sestern" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four start and landing trains, which are to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-Bahn transports passengers to the city center of Beijings in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly reported that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the - and much smaller - capital airports in Germany since 2006 has so far been relocated. In Beijing, however, a first passenger machine has already landed after four years.
New overall airplane is to fly in 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours - the British Space Agency UK Space Agency dreams. It is possible to make this flight, which has been targeted for the 2030s, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which is developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US sender CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish this," said Agent Graham Turnock to the station. "We speak of the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
The British Space Agency aims to cooperate closely with the Australian Space Agency. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis is currently about 20 hours. As the only overscaling aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the New York Paris route from 1976 until the end of its operation in 2003 and used three to three and a half hours for it. In 2000, an accident occurred at the launch of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Paris Airport, where all 109 inmates died. Last year, the US aircraft builder Lockheed Martin announced that it would develop an overshooting aircraft with Nasa, the "X Plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport", writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient journeys with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. Furthermore, such aircraft are also available outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "nearest generation of truly reusable radiation equipment".
Involvement in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tippers in Ukraine's affairs
In the Ukraine affairs for possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to find possible unlighted places in the White House.
"I want to know who has given the information to the whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday before U.S. Employees at the United Nations in New York. The affected person is almost "a spy" and in the past one was "a little different" than today.
This was regarded as an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. Several US media, however, spread audio media from the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted to the President's statement.
On Tuesday, the democrats of the U.S. House of Representatives had announced preparations for an official investigation procedure against Trump. Their accusations were based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence worker who raised serious accusations against Trump and its government centre. On great public pressure, the reporting of the advisor had been published on Thursday.
As part of his work, Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government staff, which the US president "utilizes the power of his office" in order to achieve that another country is interfering with the US election in 2020.
The centre of the announcement is a controversial phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate, which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. In doing so, it concerns former businesses of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his spearsling from the Ukrainian judicial regime. Biden is in front of the democratic presidential candidate for the election of 2020.
The whistleblower accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine telephony also of confusion: leaders of government would have tried to keep the exact text version of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic text protocol was made. This was removed from a database that was normally planned after the discussion by lawyers from the White House and was stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a gross conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the advisor is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was to be a CIA staff member of the foreign secret service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called whistleblower has spread information from second hand that would have proved incorrect. Therefore, there may be no tippers or spies at all.
Trump expressed himself in New York about those who were supposed to have played information to the Whistleblower, but displeased. The president of the U.S. representative house, Nancy Pelosi, reacted and complained that Trump's statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several committees have been carrying out several investigations against Trump and its environment for months. In view of Ukraine's predictions, democrats are now moving forward investigations with new weight in order to initiate a possible procedure of official withdrawal against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a schedule for our investigation," said the Head of the Secret Service Committee at the Representativeshaus, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, challenged him a false representation of things and again demanded the resignation of the Committee Chairman. Trump cheats ship regularly and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government staff from the security and external policy sector, who were mostly active under democratic but also under republican presidents, were backed by a statement published on Friday by the democrats initiated an investigation for a possible procedure of termination of office. If the accusations were true, the "scrupulous abuse of power" by Trump would be said.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the democrats could put forth effort to a so-called impeachment process. However, the decision on an actual official survey fell in the Senate where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. No US president has yet been exposed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Business Council: Jobs are "slow" down
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce the cost of production could go at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. These concerns drive the car manufacturer's operating council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by EUR 10 billion to EUR 2023 by EUR 2 billion, which will be saved by EUR 500 million this year.
A key key to this is the staff costs. The "Pact of Future" negotiated between the company and the operating council in 2016 already provides for the degradation of 14,000 jobs alone in Germany by 2020. In principle, a job can only be degraded by the automobile manufacturer if it is proved to be no longer necessary for the related activities. In addition, employment assurance is valid until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from operating councils, however, jobs in production, which are not actually being dispositioned, are "slucking" over another way - so they pass the official course. Thus, free regular bodies would often not be renewed.
In these cases, the Board of Operations has no possibility to force the restoration. In the meantime, staff lacking in many places to increase the compatibility of work, the concerns about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would increase. This also means that the fear that the vehicle production could be gradually deducted from Germany and Europe because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW said only: "A adjustment of the volume of employment is done as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production board Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "In unsafe times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crises."
There are already successes in this way: For example, this year the production costs per vehicle were to be reduced in 2013 compared to the previous year. Before journalists told Tostmann that the production time for the Gulf 8, which was to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on production time does not call VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is at the Golf 7 round.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg family is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the Faust rule that there are 800,000 cars to be built annually, so that the plant is satisfyingly profitable. In 2018, however, the load in Wolfsburg was only 700,000 vehicles - due to the sinking diesel demand and the problems in the conversion to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas test methods.
However, as production board Tostmann announced last year, in Wolfsburg "perspectively" one million cars are supposed to roll from the band. This is intended to allow the bundling of the golf production in the stamp - because the work Zwickau gives the golf production through the retrofit to the location for the E-auto production.
Moreover, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales numbers of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Gulf 8. He is supposed to remain first of all the bread-and-butter car of the Wolfsburgers, despite all efforts to build the e-mobility.
Forced by Voodoo to prostitution: condemned human dealers
Young women from Nigeria have been occupied with sulphur, swallowed into the Ruhrgebiet and forced to prostitute. Six suspected human dealers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected human dealers from Nigeria were sentenced in Bochum on Friday for prosecution and imprisonment sentences of up to eight years and three months. The accused women from Nigeria had been swept into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitute. In order to force their obedience, the Niger women who were elected had had to put a ritual sword in the home before a Voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean by libyan sleusers in hose boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they were distributed to various boards to finish the alleged sleeuser costs of an average of 25 000 euros. The wage was therefore completely deducted.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of young Nigerian women on boardel. "The work made women physically and psychically difficult to create," said judge Isabel Hoffmann at the judgment pronunciation. "Some of the women were properly opposed."
The judgments are based on commercial and strict involvement of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, addiction and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the long-term dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the Ufo flight companion company threatened again with strikes.
If the company would not return to the negotiating table, the trade union would "notify on 14 October about the work fighting measures in the LH Group", Ufo Tarif Board Daniel Flohr informed on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have refused to take the Ufo Tarifverhandlungs for months, as well as the question of whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
In this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to show that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the requests. The company confirmed the decision and examined, on the other hand, the appeal. "I think that a second court sees the matter completely different," said Ufo Board Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application to the Federal Labour Court of Frankfurt to allow the status of the Ufo as a trade union to be legally verified. The company argued that the trade union has not set up a representative board for months and could therefore not fill its role as collective partners.
A strong leadership dispute was preceded in the Sparten-Gewerkschaft, in which many members of the Executive Board and the Advisory Board resigned, including the long-standing trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. Ufo had suspended an original agreement on strikes of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July due to the doubts of its leadership.
Easy entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is now to change. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa destinations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and local visitors to increase to 100 million a year, the tourism Commission informed.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is one-historic moment for our country," said the Chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult to access to tourists. Visas are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrims or visitors with members of the desert state. With the new rules, the kingship of Archconservatives hopes to increase revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery of the country in Abkaik and the oil field of Churais. In the fold, national oil production drastically broke in, the oil price shoots to the height. It should take several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom again reached its old level.
Justin and Hailey Beeber are sitting in preparations for wedding festival
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for her wedding festival. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in her Instagram Stories several party photos on which she can be seen in the white wedding view. Reality Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others, according to the People's magazine, had organized a young girl's departure in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful, including banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "May me choose my smoke for the wedding." Media reports suggest that the promi pair wants to marry churches the next weekend.
A year ago, the beavers had given themselves the yes word in a New York standing office. There had not been a major festival at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in aeroplane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died during the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. On Friday the wreck was discovered in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metchin), the police informed. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had issued an emergency signal by GPS. The search was also a military helicopter in use. The calamity cause still needs to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened by extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, non-resident species, non-sustainable wooden stocks and urban growth are causes of threat, the IUCN World Nature Protection Union reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe. 265 of them are not present on any other continent. 58 percent of these 265 were threatened. 66 were already at the highest level of threat and thus before extinction.
The IUCN shares endangered species in six categories: from "potentially endangered" via "highly endangered", "highly endangered from extinction" and "dood out in nature" to "did out". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species and plants worldwide than threatened.
Ebersche and wild Rosskastanie threatened
In Germany, Eberesh (Sorbus) was particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are anyway small or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
Bad looks also like the wild rose scatters. Since 2017 they have been regarded as "hazardous", stage two of the IUCN scale. Largest threat next to a mushroom is the Balkan minier moth. It has spread from South East Europe across the continent since the 1980s and has hardly had natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Roscastania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account are trees in cities, parks and only.
Species of smoking and moose also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European red lists for weekdies, shrubs and mooses. More than a fifth of the weekdies and mooses and almost half of all shrubs were threatened, according to the IUCN. This lies mainly with the destruction of the wilderness, with drifted species, agricultural practices and climate change. Weighing animals like snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the ground and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the Europe Bureau. "We need to limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 Injured Reported
During the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. There were no dead, according to the data. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have therefore been damaged. Since the precedence of the day, there have been nearly 200 descendants. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropolises.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for shaking, Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Istanbul is considered particularly dangerous. Under the marmarameer is a section of the so-called North Anatolic disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth plate.
One of the most severe shakings was one of 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. Over 17,000 people died.
On Tuesday a quake of thickness 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira will take place in the mid-term show
The Latin Pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the mid-term show of the next American football film Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers at Twitter. "Sizer is not," Shakira wrote about a photo of herself and Lopez. She is madly excited to stand on the super bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of taking up at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying to heaven at the mid-term show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL exists 100 years and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She could hardly expect to "show what we can do on the largest stage in the world".
Shakira pointed out in an explanation that she feels honored to stand on one of the world's largest stages next to another artist and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "kings" were together on one stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents came from Puerto Rico.
Fight against sinking spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the mid-term show are among the most viewed TV transfers in the United States. Even though you have recently dropped spectators: In this February, the spectacle in the United States attracted the least spectators for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still nearly a hundred million people in average.
Around the mid-term show of the previous Super Bowl, there had been an incidence: in the fight about dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepenick, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to occur in February. Finally, the Pop Group Maroon 5 introduced the mid-term show - the criticisms were little friendly.
Kaepenick, then Quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, went to the knee in 2016/17 before NFL games at the National Hemisphere from protest against police force and racism. With his protest, Kaepenick triggered a movement, many players took over the gestures. This ensured great excitement, US president Donald Trump attacked most African football stars sharply. Kaepenick itself has been unconnected since March 2017 and has no more NFL party. He suggests that the associations do not want him for political reasons.
Cook pilot: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are expected to face the pledge of the travel provider Thomas Cook. It threatens high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans. This also affects the credit suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the credit suisses would have to make depreciations of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report. This has shown estimates by the consulting company AlixPartner.
The creditors of bonds would have to buy depreciation from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually depreciated should be more likely to be at the top of the bandwidths, said one expert to the leaf.
The amount of the losses of creditors at the end will show itself after the insolvency procedure has expired. One of the near-rising persons did not spray too much hope. For example, the around 40 planes of Thomas Cook in Great Britain are "old" and many of the properties are in bad situations. Most money could be extracted with the sale of the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it continued.
Rackete has supposedly brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who should have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any secure information about it," said the spokesman of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of rapeing, tortured and killing people in Libya. The suspected offenders were arrested in the recording camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, racing a ship of the Italian financial police. The day the three suspects had also arrived there. Against the captains, investigations were carried out for aid to illegal immigration.
United States Warn Federal Government Before Huawei
The head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government against trusting the Chinese network driver Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large," said Pai to the "Trade Sheet" with a view to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which requires each company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The applicable law also forbids the company to inform third parties about such requests," continues the FCC Chief. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "confidential declaration" by suppliers.
At first Berlin wants to try to control the risks, such as with technical solutions, reports the "Handelblatt" on the basis of its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It was "very difficult to imagine" that a governmental authority, "whoever could be able to check every single update in real time to find security risks," continues the FCC chief.
He presents close contacts with the Chinese State apparatus to the Chinese company Huawei:
The property relationships are opaque. The employees company, which is supposed to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai to the "Trade Sheet".
The U.S. has presented insights that government employees are placed within the company. Pai has recently been for conversations in Berlin to advertise for the position of the USA.
Chemical factory in Northern France burnt: Schools closed
At night residents hear explosions. A gigantic firewall lights the sky over a North-French chemistry factory. The fire is erased after hours - the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemistry factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's crabs remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open precautionally on Friday, the competent prefecture. The Ministry of Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not stop smoking. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals in, protect their food and stop the harvest first.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. It still poses the risk that after the deletion of the odor spreads, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 police and gendarmen were used at the fireplace.
From the chemical factory, a huge black smoke pillar had previously risen. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizole, the additive for oils repairing. The production plant is located a few kilometres from the city centre.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous locations that are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in the Italian Seveso in Milan.
The prefect of the Normandie region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news sender BFMTV that it was not initially found a "high toxicity" in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river, dams were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire was broke out early morning at 02.40 o'clock, the authorities reported. At first the cause remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister for Finance: "Germany must invest now"
France's Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire called on Germany to increase investments in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest now, the earlier the better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the euro area was weakening, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation becomes worse to make the necessary decisions."
Acting would have to be done by those countries who would have budget playrooms for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these playrooms, added to the minister and referred to the high state debt of his country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French government debt must be "stabilized" and "senked", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to make more public investment in order to live the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly asked France to control its budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides for tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
This means that the French government reacts, among other things, to the protests of the yellow-west movement. The new debt should be reduced to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent of this year.
Does he still try to trick?:: Johnson deviates question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes the "Capitalisation Law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could use a slump hole. However, the Tory politician deviates on this possibility.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson deals with whether he wants to carry out an unregulated Brexit, despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which is to prevent exactly this. On a question that Johnson just said before journalists that his government would comply with the applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the date of withdrawal should not have been reached agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "Capitalisation Act" which is difficult to negotiate with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political trembling" to avoid the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that shifts the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said that he strives for a contract with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Johnson's Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings said in the meantime that he feels the political controversy about Brexit as a "spaziergang in the park" and showed confidence that the desired EU exit is still to be achieved: "We enjoy that, we will win, we will (on the other hand, Red: from the EU), no concern," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the "Vote Leave" campaign in front of the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as the head of the British government seat Downing Street. He is supposed to sit behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister to a clear situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very great rock photographers. But it does not always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) is deeply immersed into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who married her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was apparently proud and touched when he presented the band "The Polaroid Diaries" in the mid-September of September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrated guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders Frontfrau Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting view of the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as an engaged artist and the immediate mass of the polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, some hundreds of them are now released in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "They wanted real moments," writes the artist Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, they are always in the centre of one: Your husband Paul - as you may never have seen him.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, phoned in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wearing unshaped moon boats. Surely, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the headlight on their farm in South England or Scotland also led a very normal life. So said Mary McCartney according to BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had brushed out of old potatoes. And it has not always been clear of the McCartneys.
How hardly a other medium the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the decision click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you, and then you have to cut it in exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you know two seconds later or two before, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift to catch the right moment always. "She just knew that she had it," said Paul in Eshun-Essay.
The light, the composition, the image cutting and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining image book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in all anecdotics, where landscapes have already worked like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the just newly imposed Beatles album "Abbey Road", which has appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
In spite of the US sanctions imposed against Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel the import of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems with importing Iranian petroleum oil, as some companies had "drawn away because of US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran especially in this question and in many other questions," said the Turkish President, who repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its exit from the International Atomic Agreement with Iran, the USA has pursued a policy of "maximal pressure" towards the Islamic Republic. According to the USA, Iran has pursued a nuclear programme in secret and does not comply with the Agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the breakdown of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months the tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
U.S. government wants to restrict the inclusion of refugees
The U.S. government intends to drastically limit the inclusion of refugees. On Thursday, the US Foreign Ministry stated that the annual ceiling of a relocation programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the US would continue to be obliged to support refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
The US government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqians who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger as shown by the Declaration of the Foreign Ministry. However, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be included from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected and relocated in the USA. The limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. The currently existing ceiling of 30,000 is lowest. As the predecessor of the US president Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was nearly 85 000.
Aid organisations reacted disgustingly to the announced reduction of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The USA would thus continue to damage their leading role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration into the US - legally and illegally - and the US government expects 350,000 applications for asylum for the next budget year. These figures are separate from the relocation programme.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a peak"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused the clue of spying in the whistleblower office. Anyone who has sent to the informant who suggests power abuse to him, "comes close to a tip," said Trump according to a record of a private event in New York on Thursday. This reports several U.S. media consistently.
As a result, Trump spoke before employees of the U.S. mission. When he was asked for the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial activities in the White House, he replied: "This is coming close to a peak." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did in old times when we were clever? Right. The spies and betrays, we used to handle it a bit different than we do now."
Observants evaluated the latter remark on a possible response to the death penalty. The democrats exerted sharp criticism of Trump's statements and challenged him intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to hinder a conference examination of a possible official remedy procedure against him, the chairs of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory Affairs in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower, in a complaint that he had abused his office in order to interfere with another country in the US-Wahl 2020. Concretely, it is about, among other things, his controversial phone call with its Ukrainian co-college Wolodymyr Selenskyj in summer: In the conversation, Trump urged him to initiate investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump challenges any misconduct.
However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of CIA's foreign secret service.
Refugee boat cemented: Drinking baby and babies in Aegean
On a regular basis, people try to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The often too small boats are often known. Seven migrants have now died, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants died during the fall of a hose boat. Among the death victims were also a baby and four other children, the Greek coastal guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be saved from the floods from the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims should also be a slumber, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inouses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not known from which countries the migrants originate. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in much to small boats. Over the past year, as reported by the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNHCR) 174 people died on this route.
The Who breaks concert
A U.S. Concert of the Rockband The Who has found a hurry end because of an inappropriateness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the event on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. At the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it is still running."
Lead-Gitarist Pete Townsend asked for apologies and added that Daltrey could "now not speak". Townsend promised to come to his expense at a reconciliation concert. However, an appointment is not yet established.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who said that they should be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rentation suddenly stopped: WeWork lets real estate markets tumble
In New York, WeWork has rose as the largest office owner.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from small startup to driving force on the world's most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis. Rentners must fear billions of revenue.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork threatens to disturb the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set off the founder Adam Neumann as the boss, postponed the planned stock exchange course and launched the sale of subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives to win financial space for the coming weeks and months. Among other things, the British "financial Times", WeWork has stopped the completion of new rents with immediate effect, among other things, the largest tenants of office spaces in New York and London suddenly from the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces in the long term and rents them in partly small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or whole departments of large companies. WeWork burns money with this business in a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company entered a loss of $11.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion. This year alone, the renting costs are supposed to have increased to an estimated $2.5 billion. To limit the loss, the new company management should now pull the emergency brakes and stop renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now concluded rental contracts with periods of up to 15 years of commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could not only be a problem for the company itself and its investors, but for all real estate markets.
According to WeWork in Manhatten, one of the world's most expensive real estate markets, in the past 24 months, weWork's new contracts have been renting nearly 300,000 square metres of office space. Without WeWork's expansion, the US metropolis would have increased in this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". Similarly, in London, where WeWork is now operating several dozen office locations in the best position.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could be noticeable without any further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is main rental, in a last year Deka office house purchased by the Sparkassen funding provider for nearly 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have rebuilt their property for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would have to declare some of the hoped billion revenues. Access to the - yet scarce - reserves of WeWork do not have in spite of the long-term rental contracts. Because the renting of the individual locations of WeWork is usually done by any additionally founded subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is liable only in narrow limits.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coastal Guard has again taken place against North Korean fishermen. Over the past few days, more 262 wildlifers who had been illegally fished in the waters had been arrested, the Russian FSB informed the Interfax Agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. Previously, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it said.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian high-risk waters. There, according to their own information, the coastal guards of Russia drive to protect their marine biological resources patrols. During the new controls, 30,000 ink fish were discovered. In addition, the data were confiscated by three fishing and two motorboats and brought to Naodka and Posjet at Wladivostok. According to the Ria Nowosti Agency, the coastal guard in 2018 established over 8,000 infringements.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans, even after claims by local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries companies in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with closely synthetic networks banned in Russia. With these small living creatures would also get out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be broken. The ships themselves do not comply with the hygiene and technical requirements.
According to Moscow’s three members of the Russian Coastal Guard were injured during the previous week's arrests. According to a also wounded North Korean, the FSB later died of his injuries. Russian border guards first established a North Korean boat and then a second after this opened the fire.
United States prohibition of entry against ex-president Castro
The United States has banned entry against former Cuban president Raúl Castro and his children. The American Foreign Ministry founded this in a communication on Thursday with Castros' participation in "great human rights violations". As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he presupposes a system in which thousands of Cubans would be arrested arbitraryly and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As president of the military forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary director Fidel Castro is also guilty of human rights violations there by supporting President Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disrespect of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the persistent crisis on Cuba and Venezuela," said American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had proclaimed a ban on entry against members of the Venezolan government and the military. For months in Venezuela, a bitter struggle of power between the government and the opposition. The USA have imposed a whole range of sanctions against Maduro’s government to force him into the knee and to help the opposition leader and self-president Juan Guadió power.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allies of Maduros. The Socialist Caribbean Island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services sent by doctors. According to the U.S. and the Venezolan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government with the oppression of government opponents.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go to the street for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement plans again action and announcements in dozens of countries around the world. The start should be made because of the time shifting New Zealand and Australia before the protests about Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large announcement in the Canadian Montreal. Even before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather.
How great the global commitment to this Friday will be after the recording of the previous week, it is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday have spread over four million people for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, in the context of the strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
A good third of all the world's demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had been involved in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates of Fridays for Future. This time, a list of demonstrations in at least 65 cities are planned. Among them, in Metropolen, such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, as well as in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go to the street for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to demand the politicians of her country for a stronger use for climate protection. In a short time, the Fridays-for-Future movement has emerged. Climate protests are mainly involved in students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition from policy in the fight against heating and the threatening climate disaster. In particular, the Paris Climate Agreement requires a reduction of global warming to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial time.
Thunberg had arrived nearly a month ago after a two-week transatlantic door with a high-sea racing yacht in New York, where she had last taken part in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she held an emotional speech to the UN, in which she utterly spoke to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home, Stockholm, she was given herself for her use for more climate protection of the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
People in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This means a change in fire protection. "This is also true of smoking," said a speaker from the Ministry of Emergency in Moscow on Thursday, the Tass Agency. The ban will enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who still smokes must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should release a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry's prohibition, even burning candles fall under the ban. It is no longer allowed to grill meat on the balcony.
Stamp against cyber criminals - investigators lift up servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time lifted out a large server provider for illegal businesses in the Darknet.
A total of 13 offenders are suspicious to have hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel, which have operated their crafts by international criminals.
Seven suspects were arrested at a large action on Thursday evening. The Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Customers of the deceit suspects should have been among other things the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", who had broken investigators in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the cyberbunker, according to the prosecutor-General.
Such a hoster had been eliminated in Germany for the first time. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
With the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and in the neighbouring abroad. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. In the afternoon, the investigators would like to inform about more details.
New World Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement planned again actions and announcements in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale community in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests ▶ Who are actually Thunberg's behind men?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. The more amazing that a 16-year-old girl keeps the powermen of this time the mirror ahead of the nose. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or wise marketing a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for himself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in motion and brings young people to rise for a better climate-friendly world. It is not historically the first time in Europe that a young man manages to win a gathering of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt elected to use a more righteous world. At that time, he has also been able to win a crowd of young people for himself and overwhelms it to cross the sea to get to the proclaimed country, as Greta Thunberg has recently done on the journey to America with a sailboat.
But there is a shadow side in this? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? Greta Thunberg also has rich PR managers on her side. In addition, her mother has published a book that has sold itself far-reachingly thanks to the daughter in the Rampenlicht. Also old-profit followers from Greta Thunberg were a little disturbed over the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably also too thick. This is not unfounded, because the action came very well in the media worldwide and it flows a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
Here, the spirits are now divorced: Is it morally correct to achieve financially in rescuing the world? Is it still authentic if certain people are working together with stock exchange brokers during the world's rescue action? No matter what position it is ultimately involved, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democraticly characterized society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. That is why it can certainly make sense to critically question seemingly vicious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet is crossing our solar system at the moment.
The astronomers have confirmed: A foreign comet crosses our solar system at the moment - he is only the second of his kind.
Garching/Washington - The researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet of another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and is currently busy astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow in Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and other post-observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of his kind that was seen during the flight.
The great chance for astronomers is now to haze insights into a foreign solar system from nearby. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical Institute of Canaries. The comet is clearly interstellar according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbel track that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before flight - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, the astronomers can observe it thoroughly. As opposed to its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that it can be examined from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia by the US Space Authority Nasa. "Then it will only be seen by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers of diameter. At the same time, the celestial bodies appear to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it out, the spectrum of the floating star is similar to us. This observation suggests that comets in other sun systems could form themselves through similar processes as in our León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids repeatedly employ the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid passed the earth and came dangerously close to her.
"Absolutely disgusting": Rachel Johnson is disgusted about brother
For Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister crushes the warrior language of the premier as "smellless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitalisation", "Betrug", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson stands under pressure and is constantly reared up - at least verbally. At the questionnaire at the suburb on this Wednesday, this was due to massive annoyment of the opposition, and in the meantime, more critics have reported themselves: Dozens of Bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author said to the Sender Sky News that her brother was using words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, longened, quarried, toughed and feathered". She considers that very disgusting. You do not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had arrived at the elections to the EU Parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
She was particularly concerned that her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly sub-house member who had been murdered by a Neonazi, had said Boris Johnson in the sub-house just a few days before the exit referendum in 2016. It is very tasty to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," now criticized Johnson's sister. The offender obviously came from the legal extreme camp that feels "through this kind of language". For all those who mourned them, it is very tasteless.
The widow of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jos name is used in this way," he twittered. The best way to honor them is if one enters passionately and determined for what one believes - no matter which view one is. But never should one "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen which had become more likely in attacks.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had set up his office as State Secretary and his mandate as Tory deputy. "I have been crushed between loyalty to family and national interest - it is an insoluble tension," Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson's language also found sharp criticism in the church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "this country is not worthy." In a common statement, they explained: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside the Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez take place at Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year existence: In the mid-term show of the coming Super Bowl, two women with Latino's roots appear. They promise "a explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the next final of the US football Liga NFL. This was announced by the organisers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because this has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira reported in a video.
The final of the American football liga, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, takes place in Miami on February 2nd. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") is from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a parrot-rican origin.
"I love the super bowl to stage two women this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-olds were born in New York after their parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the "Hustlers" drama from November onwards in German cinemas.
Shakira became known as a star of a Telenovela and singer in Colombia. She created her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first two-language album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of half-time guests is expected in the USA each time with tension. This year many are also becoming the choice as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a gigantic spectacle of advertising. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones provided Furore. Usually over 100 million TV viewers watch the NFL-finals, it is also extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, political controversy occurred in advance. The dispute about the Quarterback Colin Kaepenick, who had refused to rise from protest against police force against blacks when playing the National Hemisphere and had, among other things, been attacked by US president Donald Trump. From solidarity with Kaepenick, some musicians had refused a super-bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the Rock Group took up Maroon 5 was finally criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber assigns Egypt's ruler: Mohamed Ali would prefer to stay abroad.
The two men who have influenced whether blood flows on the streets of Egypt have spent both abroad last week. One of them swooped again at the airport of Cairo on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The Ex-General, who put off the Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisis' action against political Islam and did not lose any syllables about human rights violations at the Nile - a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had "no reason to worry," said Sisi at the airport in the microphone of the State's television. "The Egyptians don't let go into the error."
In the wrong way, the President of the other man, who is currently determining what happens on the streets, attempts to do. Of course, Mohamed Ali stayed abroad, where he escapes the access of the security forces that would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian ground. Week ago, the 45-year-old actor was known as only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tonnic voice that prevails the political discourse in the cafés, the living room and the tarpoons of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets" Ali calls his countrymen to raise up against Sisi.
He goes on to the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people hung, the president swallows in luxury and let himself build beautiful new palaces, it says. The army leadership on which Sisi bases its reign suggests ali corruption and enrichment. Because he made in his second profession as a builder for 15 years with exactly these men businesses, it seems to be quite accurate to know what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egyptians, as shown by the precisely explosive click numbers.
After being arrested for the first time last week since Sisis Griff had demonstrated thousands against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, Ali called for this Friday to be a "million march". However, there was an unlikely number of people in the streets. But there were small protests, for example, in Giseh at Cairo and in the place of Kina at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants rejected Al-Sisi corruption and demanded its departure. At these protests, the police also introduced tear gas and rubber floors. These videos did not initially be verified independently. From security circles, the police said that the protests ended.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators last week Banner with the portrait of the President, was reported on Friday massive police presence. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the exit streets. In Cairo several metro stations were closed in the city for "conservation work", most streets around the Tarir Square, the heart of the Revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, where in 2013 followers of the crashed Muslim brother Mursi were shed, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another action should prevent that unpeoparded: Sisis's future party would in fact hold a great gift for the president here.
Mohamed Ali caused these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be the Tarir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us collapse with police officers. But as a retreater it is not to be understood: "All Egypt is the Tahrirplatz".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than the provider has requested, there are various testing options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not need to be blindly trusting the speed details of the providers. Customers can verify how much of it is actually achieved in case of notices.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a component of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Centre.
If the connection always appears to be much slower than requested by the provider, there are different testing options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed by the contract.
"The tests of the providers, however, are carried out according to the specific requirements of the provider and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively", says the Bavarian consumer centre on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of 14 days in order to produce the promised performance. This is best done by the person concerned by writing in writing.
This does not affect anything even after multiple calls, customers can cancel and may also demand compensation. However, in the event of persistent success, only help the appeal path.
First ranking Republicans for investigation
As the first ranking Republican, the governor of Vermont has spoken for an impeachment investigation against US president Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that is from here it is determined by the facts that are identified," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affairs before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the postponement of the President - can be taken.
Scott said that he was not surprised by enthusiasms that Trump had repeatedly asked the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by the democratic president and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. For Trump observed bids "since years".
To date, Republicans have refrained from criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower affairs; few have shown discomfort. Scott's comments are a first sign of this in Trump's Party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy several times, for example, against the elimination of environmental legislation and the strengthening of immigration legislation.
Spider-Man stays in MCU: Next Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separately in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avenger" universe. It was quite unclear how it should continue with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives a further final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) according to "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This report is consistent with several US media. Accordingly, the cinema starts: The film will start in the USA from July 16, 2021 onwards.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidey's way will be continued in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue working on it ... He is the only super hero with the ability to play in various universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verses. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel is supposed to have presented an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of Spider-Man-Movies. However, the message is not confirmed.
So Duke Meghan and Prince Harry show up in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "suits" in the United States has now reached the big finale. In the last episode there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked in the series for many years, has been taunted in a charming way. Attention, the following sections include spoilers for the series final.
One way ahead: Duke Meghan did not return in the final for a last abschieds greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospects showed again the most memorable scenes with today's Duke. For example, the moments of the failed and happy wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his detention sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) goes straight towards Altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a fascinating remark about his suit. Whether he actually thrown himself over a cord, the spoiled Harvey of the Brigadegroom wants to know only to notice, "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Aegeans: Baby and four other children drown at boat accident
A baby and four other children are drowned when a refugee boat in the Aegean. Overall, seven people died in the calamity, as the Greek coastal guard reported on Friday. The nationalities were still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Over the past year, according to the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNHCR) 174 people were killed. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced to want to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the competent EU Commissioner, he wanted to "inform in Turkey about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. He then wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens to help meet the situation.
On Friday, a spokesman of the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip to Seehofers with the EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusually many migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people were transferred to the Greek islands, said by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still function?
The increased figures have recently led to doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey Agreement, which provides that the EU can return all refugees and migrants who are illegally coming across Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deferred Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult on the Greek side because of the lack of staff. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, nearly 29 400 people are experiencing. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 migrates are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
It has never been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, the state radio reported.

Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, older people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photo pan
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election struggle - was manipulated for this reason of the cup?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in hand on a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw halm has never kept in hand Elizabeth May, the chief of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website she was on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and there was the cup still a snouter (pap) cup, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green chef has to be responsible for photo pan
The National Post then challenged May manipulation and that the Fake News Party produces to appear more credible in the theme of "Environmental Protection". And that in the middle of a election to the Unterhaus-Wahl, in which Trudeau is increasingly difficult because of a bribe scandal.
The photo went into the social media viral and argued the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a counterover of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen in order to hide their movement cups."
May showed herself shocked and reiterated on her blog, not knowing anything about this action. To underline this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, the one who put her right, was from Bamboo. She always had him. A spokesman of the party said that it was only about to store the party logo in the picture and not to hide something. From the photo is only a section on the website.
May writes, it is her pity for the staff who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said to the Guardian and at the same time asked something from her overgiving team: "If they want to work a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens also came to Shitstorms because of their use of uncomfortable plastics or for flight trips, but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the chief of Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, at holidays ice with plastic spoons, as Merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free-upgrade: lifetime flight prohibition at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng was guaranteed an upgrade by Cathay Pacific by mail. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to board - and she should never fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get an upgrade for the Business Class - of which many passengers dream. Sometimes they have happiness, and the staff at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class free.
However, this case shows how to not do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng is following more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she returned from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the way, Jaqueline refused an upgrade, although she had shown a mail in which her Cathay Pacific claimed to have an upgrade. The letter wants to have received the influencer from a marketing worker of the Airline. However, the Airline accuses Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time, the woman should have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they hacked up at the central. And actually, the employee from whom the mail claimed to have dismissed the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the news did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about €2,280) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had refunded the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay the influencer has committed fraud, it remains locked for future flights. Furthermore, the airline's terms and conditions state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now set up a lawyer.
According to the report on the ceasefire in Yemen, oil prices indicate
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday noon. Lastly, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dropped by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The launcher of the course was a report from the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia was said to have approved a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had caused five percent of the global oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels in the civil war country of Yemen, together with Iran, had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US Government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would deteriorate the political tension in the region.
If an agreement could actually be reached, one could concentrate on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the Department of Raw Material Strategy at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices continue its downward movement over the past days. One week ago, a barrel WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Lastly, Bloomberg, called on Insider, reported that the repair of oil plants in Saudi Arabia has progressed faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. Accordingly, the production volume has reached a volume of eight million barrel per day and is moving towards the original amount again.
Recently, there were several press releases called on insider, reporting on the rapid progress of the Saudi Aramco State Oil Group in repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco was currently trying to plan a stock exchange and avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation occurred in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently issued release on the way to leave the harbour. The crew now prepares the departure, while the ship continued to lie before anchor, Reederijk Erik Hånell informed the Swedish radio in a SMS on Friday morning.
However, the US announced to move defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian Erzfeind to Saudi Arabia. The fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the USA and Great Britain had temporarily increased oil prices in recent weeks.
Announcements against Trump aggravate
In the affairs for possible abuse of power by US president Donald Trump, confusion claims have become loud against the White House. Several leading government workers had intensely tried to prevent access to the wording of the conversation by the end of July after a disputed telephone between Trump and the Ukrainian president Wolodymyr Selenskyj. This explained an anonymous advisor. The speaker of the representative house, the democrat Nancy Pelosi, expelled the White House "dreasy".
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has made doubts that in the nuclear dispute, there will soon be a third summit of powermen Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of success of such a meeting would be questionable for lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said Spitzendiplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the Agency KCNA.
The US hadn't done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the consultant of the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticized stronger US sanctions and the common military manoeuvre of the USA and South Korea. But he hopes for a "wise" and " courageous" decision Trumps to get closer again.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was supposed to bring to Hanoi since the failure of the second summit of Trump and Kim in February. In June, both of them met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to re-experience the discussions, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers are supposed to help clean up mines
The British Prince Harry, in Angola, is a blue splitter-protected vest, symbolically fired and destroyed a springgmine. Near a camp of the British Halo Trusts near the town of Dirico, he created the ignition circle. In a safe distance, the sponge body exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola free from mine until 2025, he later asked before running TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but they have not helped to get away from them for help."
Pounds under pressure - Interest reduction expected
British pound under pressure
Given a rapid reduction in interest rates, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on a short-term interest reduction of the Bank of England (BoE) increase the pound sterling. The British currency reimbursed up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars on Friday.
The triggers of sales were statements by the note banker Michael Saunders. This brought an interest reduction into conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be reversed, as the insurance would affect the British economy at the foreseeable time. This statement was surprising, since Saunders were the defender of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens for the economy by the Brexit hick hack without signaling a direct reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wishes to lead his country, if necessary, from the EU on 31 October without a divorce agreement.
More: With its provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay for him, according to trade sheet editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated – this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Athletic Association (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity.
New details about the Doping Scandal in Russia are coming to the start of the Light Athletics World Cup - and they destroy the few of the credibility that the Russian sport had recovered at the beginning of the year and also only as an asset. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered the desired samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports had been unveiled. The Wada had locked the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee read about 270 athletes from the country under neutral flag after individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, during the winter games in February 2018, were 168 Russian sportsmen and athletes at the start. Also at the world Cups in the various sports, they were allowed to be in the summer of Russia even the football World Cup with the host.
Positive findings are missing
In the following September, the Wada resumed the Rusada bann, but called for access to the laboratory and the samples mentioned. The data should provide information on the extent of the confusion of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Leichtathletik World Association (IAAF) has confirmed, however, that the Doping Data was manipulated from the Moscow analysis laboratory. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check if the Task Force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have detected numerous discrepancys between the data that the Wada has received from a whistleblower, and those who received it from the Russians in January." Many positive findings that have been mentioned in the McLaren report.
The WM is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Leichtathletik Association holds as the only organization on the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train out of the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already put into the room and requested Russia to answer the accusations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the re-locking of the Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
