Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusions with the Muppets
The proposal to amend its title to 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) is disturbing in some Members of the National Assembly.
For this reason, plans are to change the name of the National Assembly to 'Welsh Parliament' (Walish Parliament).
National Assembly members of all political directions fear being the target of the spot.
One member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’ are ripening.
For non-visual readers: In the Welsh, 'twp' stands for 'doof' and 'pwp' for 'Aa'.
A national meeting member of the Plaid Cymru Party indicated that the whole group was "not happy" and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name, but pointed to the great similarity between 'MWP' and 'Muppet'.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Board), which is currently drafting a law for the change of names, said: "The final decision on designations for the members of the national assembly is of course with the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Board published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which provided broad support for the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
With regard to the titles of the members of the National Assembly, the Committee on Welsh Parliament Members (Walisian Parliament members) or WMPs preferred, while the option 'MWP' was the most supported in a public hearing.
National Assembly members appear to propose alternative options, but the ringing for a consensus for President Elin Jones, who is supposed to present a draft law within weeks, could be a problem.
The Act on Reforms will include further amendments to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of national meeting members and the design of the Committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may vote definitively on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonian votes in a referendum on a change in the country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country is to be changed to 'Republic northern Macedonia'.
The referendum was appointed to set up a decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the same name of Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim raises the Greek territory and has repeatedly expressed itself against its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the people's vote on the change of name, said that he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
"Today there is no more both."
He said that the disappearance of the bars was traceable.
"The social life of people today looks different," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, in which people find themselves regularly."
In the church he fears that the money from the sale of assets is not enough as long as the church leaders accept, and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with dwellings in which people live who do not support the remaining refugees.
"The overwhelming majority of people buying residences in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and so that the complete closure of these churches is accelerated, as it is unlikely that most of the people who enter into these property dwellings will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a Boykott of retailers in 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to stop or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's community members planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, the bell game proudly referred to as "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who called the bell game in July, used other words: 'A cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also found that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was 18 years ago turned to the larger bell game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been added partly by the lay leaders of the Church and part by the Bishop Diocese.
In July, the municipal board – the leaders of the municipality – expressed written concerns about the Diocese that the Diocese would try to pass the costs on to the municipal board, although it had not been involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some members complain about lack of transparency on the Diocese sides.
Hai injured in California 13-year-olds diving after Lobster
In California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy after the diving of Lobster.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the broadcaster KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy's help cry and padded with several others to the boy to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy was happy to have caught a praiser, but then he realized that the boy cried: “I have been bited!
I have been bited!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire key leg was pulled up.
“I shouted that all should come out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was fought to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Captain Larry Giles said to the media that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier in the area, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
For research purposes and for security reasons, officials blocked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans advance to the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks boats, superdrugs and Debenhams with charming cosmetic departments that are specialized by specialist assistants.
As part of a large project on the 2.8 billion British pounds of comprehensive cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, while fashion and household goods turn down, the larger cosmetic departments in 11 branches are tested throughout the country. If they are successful, they will be extended to further branches in the next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for possibilities to use store spaces previously used for television equipment, microwave equipment and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the scope of its cosmetic offer doubles for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket performs a relaunch of its "Boutique" makeup series, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the parfum dealer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury's branches. The first sales site was opened last week in Croydon in South London, and a second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the further course of this year.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local supplies business means that supermarkets need to do more to cause customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales offices will increasingly look like shops, as the supermarket chain with more services and non-food products tries to fight against the discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has set up a number of habitat sales offices in hundreds of branches of Argos sales offices and also in addition. This has increased food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
At the beginning of the 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats, which ended after a dispute about the distribution of revenue from the branches of the drug dealer in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sales of its 281 branches of comprehensive pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan as an extended range of luxury home care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy are added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetic departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brands range is tailored to all needs. Due to the tempting environment and the cheap locations, we are now an attractive goal for cosmetic purchases that challenges the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones "angry" after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million British pounds
"Dragons' Den" Star Peter Jones is "angry", after TV moderator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby annoyed "Dragons' Den" Star Peter Jones by her very short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connecting contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was supposed to have been "angry" when the "Golden Girl" of television admitted to the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly not enough time due to its new businesses – worth up to 1.5 million British pounds – during a tense discussion on Tuesday in the central of his business imperial in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have probably doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left Britain on the way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly had by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should ensure their future in the long term over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw was totally surprising for all stakeholders.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so shortly before the launch of the market.
In the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" moderator, which is one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear and potential further delays in market introduction.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, came as Chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a share of 40 percent in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is supposed to be a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as a moderator of the ITV broadcast "I'm A Celebrity".
A Jones nearest source said last night: "We don't comment on his business affairs."
Hard words 'and then we fell in love'
He summoned the criticism that he expected of the news media for a comment that some would regard as 'non-presidential' and for so positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news-moderator:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, denuclearisation negotiations have been launched.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the highest diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a 'according reaction' to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the United States held sanctions that should maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were in front of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of the missile tests, support in the release of hostages and re-transmission of the mortal remains of American military members.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people who stand outside and try to enter this overcrowded arena would stand here about 200 people," said Trump and showed the crowd right before him.
Tsunami and earthquakes ruin an island in Indonesia and costs hundreds of human lives
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said they would not be used.
Although more than 10 percent of the population were displaced by Lombok, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilisation of international aid.
"In many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international support, so that's a little difficult," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children set up a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet sure whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, speaker of the Civil Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu whether international bodies should participate in the aid measures.
Given the shocks that Indonesia has constantly to fight, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While building in Aceh Tsunami protection accommodations, these on other coastal stripes are not an everyday sight.
Despite a warning in force, apparently missing tsunamiwarnsirene in Palu has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is a challenge in the best case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lazaret ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new catastrophe in the earliest three days.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of the affected Indonesian infrastructure the core part of his election campaign and spent abundantly money on roads and railroads.
However, the government of the next year's re-election yoko suffers from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure by persistent confession tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes and homes when bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machets, arrows and bows, as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation hit against Chelsea
On Saturday, Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 backstand of his team in about 27 meters away from the gate of Chelsea.
He targeted the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the back pist.
The shot sailed high over the penalty room and drifted into the right upper corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the network.
“I have just tried to get myself into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for me," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edge and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just accepted the shot."
Chelsea followed a hit in the 25th minute through the Belgian Star Eden Hazard at 1:0 in the mid-term.
The Blues storm returned a pass with the heel to Mateo, then turned around near the middle field and sprinted half into the Liverpooler.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good steep pass, so that Hazard came into the penalty.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed with a left shot at Liverpools Alisson Becker passing back into the network.
Liverpool plays at the group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 in the San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea is opposed to the UEFA Europe League videoton in London on Thursday at 15:00 p.m.
Number of deaths of tsunamis in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the civil protection authority reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were supposed to be trapped in the debris of buildings that had been crashed by the earthquake of thickness 7.5 from Friday, which had caused waves up to six meters high, reported the government speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was overseas with the debris of crashed buildings.
Police arrests man, 32, because of suspicion of murder after a woman was invaded
After the discovery of a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with stich wounds in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for suspicion.
The police call on the residents to report if they have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early phase, but I ask all those who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all persons, especially taxi drivers who may have taken up some contact with a Dashcam. They may have information that is of utmost importance for our investigation."
A police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Today's afternoon friends who believe the woman have arrived at the place of action to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations run, and the police informed that she was in the process of informing the victim's next members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but the police was informed that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The inhabitants are now informed that it will take hours to enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that now the whole area is treated as a deed.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
It repeats repeatedly, 'that is so terrible'.
At 14:00 a.m., two police vehicles were in the lock and another vehicle in front of the lock.
Within the locking, several police officers were watching the residential block.
Persons with information shall be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call the number 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and refer to the 247 protocol entry of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue before Parliament will be a new monument to the debate on the rewrite of history.
Their ban would be poetic justice for its destruction of the Taliban, which is reminiscent of so many cultural and religious art products of England by its fanatic puritanian followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as 'Tority' and 'Recovery of history'.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the present debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s statue was aimed at the palace of Westminster.
The picture storm in the English civil wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the acts of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th-century opinion and part of the history writing of a figure, which many believe still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today than anyone who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, of course, by the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully appropriate presentation is the subject of continuing historical debates.
Certainly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this gap.
His services as Lordprotector are also worth celebrating them and reminding them."
Killer swine bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer on a market in the southwest of China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the surname was called 'Yuan', was found dead in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China, is prepared to inject vaccines for pigs.
He was reported on Wednesday with his cousin from Yunnan's neighbouring province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a neighboring pig.
He said that in the stable a large male pig was found with blood on the snail.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 pounds of heavy pig had been killed by the farmers.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and mutilated," the cousin called "Wu" was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager said Evening News that the pig had been imprisoned to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the crime site.
According to Yuan's family and the market authorities, they negotiate reports on compensation for his death.
It is rare that pigs attack people, but such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 pounds of heavy pig tied a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could leave the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as “inducers”.
"They're just playing.
They like to twist and are very curious, ... they're not trying to hurt someone.
You only need to treat them with the right degree of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread strong rain into the southwest of the USA
As forecast, hurricane Rosa is weakening on the way over the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring flooding rainfalles in northern Mexico and the southwest of the USA.
On Sunday at 5:00 east coast time Rosa showed wind speeds from 136 km/h, which corresponds to a hurricane of category 1, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough over the Pacific begins to form, moving towards the east to the western coast of the USA. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported northwards to the southwest of the USA.
Rosa will trigger up to 25 centimeters of rain on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity produces strong rains in the southwest in the coming days by interactions with the attracting trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous floody flooding, water-driving shoes and possibly earthruth in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to rainfall rates from almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall is expected.
Due to the spread of tropical precipitation, there is a possibility of fluid-like flooding with rapid deterioration conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical precipitations, it is urgently refused to walk into the desert.
Strong precipitation can lead to ripping currents from canyons, and thunderstorms locally bring windbows as well as wind that leads dust.
The nearest trough brings locally strong rain in parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total lowering amounts may be over a centimeter, which can lead to low-speed water-driving shaving and smooth roadways.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first single tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widespread.
On Tuesday, strong rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and lasts Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the USA, as the Arctic cools off while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the USA.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the ongoing summer warmth tries to develop and expand.
For a large part of the center and the east of the USA, a warm October beginning with widespread temperatures around 27 oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of excess temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the USA.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
At six television networks on Thursday, more than 20 million spectators saw the fascinating statements of the Board Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual attacks in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political Patt situation stopped. On Friday the television stations interrupted their regular program because of a turning in the last minute: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, to carry out a weekly investigation of accusations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, had been in need of her and had tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average number of viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audience numbers in offices.
To move this into the right perspective: This corresponds to the spectators in a play-off football game or in the Oscar award.
According to Nielsen, the channel Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the whole-day hearing.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After publishing a statement for Kavanaugh, the office of the moderate Republicaner was filmed by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as protesters in the elevator on the way to hear the Judiciary Committee loudly in need of words.
He stood for minutes with reduced view while he was scraped. The scene was transferred live at CNN.
"I stand here right before you," said a woman.
"Do you believe that he tells the country the truth?"
"They have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said that his office had published a declaration and supplemented before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say in the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks were sent live hours later, when the Judicial Committee on the forwarding of the nomination of Kavanaughs should vote to the entire senate.
However, Flake said that he would do this only under the condition that the FBI, as demanded by the democratic minority, would examine the accusations against the candidates next week.
Flake was partially convinced by talks with a friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a talk with coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has caused a FBI investigation of the accusations raised against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May accused in an interview with the Sunday Times critic of her plans for the withdrawal from the European Union to use the future of Britain for political purposes and to undermine the interests of the nation.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives on September 29, 2018 on the Party Day of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In an interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called "Chequers-Plan" for Brexit by calling a proposal that provides for the mutual engagement of customs duties by the UK and the EU as "completely absurd".
Killing shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrests suspicious Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained by Baton Rouge's police for killing.
The authority published video recordings of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As reported by the CBS partner station WAFB, the police secured the glasses in the Tatort and said that the brilliant DNA of Simpson had been found.
After a survey of Simpsons, the police reported that he had stood the deadly shots on Wayde.
The Advocate reported that the deposit had been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shot on the neck.
The police thanked the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the criminal laboratory of the Federal State Police, Southern University Police and citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU-Sport Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement authority for "their care and their pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season, he achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball trainer of the LSU said, Will Wade, that the team was "fastly shaken" about Wayde's death and "stand under shock".
"There is always fear of such a thing," said Wade.
Volcano feeds ashes on Mexico City.
Out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday, after the activity in the crater had increased and within 24 hours 183 gas and ashes were registered.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of shakes and shocks.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windscreens of cars in quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics, since in September 2017 an earthquake of 7.1 Central Mexican has shaken, have established increased activity on the 72 kilometers south-east of the capital volcano.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona six persons were arrested on Saturday after collapse between the readiness police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held by the prepared police, collected it with eggs and swallowed colour powder, so that dark dust clouds were created in the streets normally populated by tourists.
In the further day history, the police, who used their pockets to stop the fights, also came to hand convenience.
For several hours, scanned pro-independence groups 'No forgotten, no forgiveness', while they faced Unionists who called 'Lang live Spain'.
The local press reported that fourteen people were treated for smaller injuries in protests.
One year after the referendum dated 1 October, which Madrid saw as illegal, but was celebrated by separate Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had decided by an overwhelming majority for independence, although the vote was low, since the splitting opposers had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent collisions before the elections.
Pro-independence groups had camped outside on Friday overnight to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electricist who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said that he no longer saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence with hope.
“Last year we have experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they were able to choose, but now we hang fast," he said.
Despite an important, though scarce, victory at the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulty maintaining the vibration. Many of their most famous leaders are either in exile or in detention, where they wait for their procedures for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest for the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been violated by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in charge of investigation since the end of last year, announced his candidate for the election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European election, the best way is to condemn the degradation of democratic values and oppression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was trapped by car
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been arrested several times by a car.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
In addition, a armbrust may have been shot on the car.
Menga-Treffer means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first gate for Livingston secured the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hits proved to be crucial for Gary Holt's team in the second half of his life with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team stays in the premiership in this season and stands the next Sunday opposite the Hearts, which lie back eight points.
Previously, the Rangers are hosts for Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase its victory series in the division to six games, i.e., chef trainer Holt has no defeat to record since his acquisition of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against freely playing guests
Holt's team had to have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness presented the Rangers to the most different problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but became slower in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he was ingenious to meet Craig Halkett's head shot by the gate.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of themselves, knowing that they could hinder guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive gate was established.
The Rangers allowed a free shot, and Livingston prepared a chance to bring Menga together with Declan Gallagher and Robinson into shot position. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the penal room.
In this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but could not overcome the defense of the hosts, and the gatekeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unexplained.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced to defence.
Scott Pittman was fired by the Rangers Tower Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow slipped the ball by another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanken returned to the penalty of Livingston and were regularly taken out of the danger area, while two claimed penalties – one of Halkett’s against the alternate Glenn Middleton and one because of handmade – were refused.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have overlooked the expectations of this upward trend.
Their way of playing and their team has hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt pays great praise for the way in which he has woke up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on track throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as they were temporarily under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Her last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the team of hosts – and this is something like a alarm call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Received Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), smiling faces and blue skys reigned when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO associations.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterwards Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security reasons for keeping a 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many fans found themselves near to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurden – also heard. They condemned Erdogan’s policy as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German Turks as a hero and reproached by others as a carcrat.
Transport accident in Deptford: cyclist dies on collision with car
During a collision with a car, a cyclist died in London.
The collision took place at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic-rich road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and he cared for the man who died in the accident site.
Months before the accident another cyclist had died in an accident with an escape flight in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from the accident from Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his next family.
Road barriers and redirections for buses are set up, and the drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officials injured in trouble
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in a high-security prison for men.
The unrests broke out on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still stop.
Specialized “Tornado” officials were added to end the disturbances involving eight inmates who are limited to a wing.
The officials were treated on site for smaller injuries in the face.
One speaker of the Prison Service said: “It was specially trained prison staff used to fix a persistent incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to clarify that the police officers will be handed over to the police and may spend a long time behind grids."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader was treated by a prisoner in the hospital after an attack.
In October last year, employee officials were called to prison in order to combat severe unrests in which the staff had been attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floody floods (drough areas may benefit)
It rarely occurs that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what will probably happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the southwest of deserts and bring the risk of floody flooding.
The National Weather Service has already published warnings of flooding floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west from Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and pass through Phoenix on Tuesday.
In a Tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix informed that “only ten tropical cyclones have come near as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres from Arizona's border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall with a singled up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest of deserts, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5 to 5 centimeters and a total of up to 10 centimeters.
For those who do not have the risk of floody flooding, the rains associated with Rosa may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although flooding is of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in some cases, since there is currently drought in the southwest.
According to the U. S. Drought Monitor, there are at least 40 percent of Arizona’s extreme drought, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. The hurricane will then move north with 19 kilometres per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will meet on colder water and thus weaken.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will meet in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
The precipitation may fall greatly in parts of Mexico, so that there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitations are expected from 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters being possible," weather.com reported.
Afterwards, Rosa will move as a tropical storm northward over Mexico, on early Tuesday morning as tropical depression reach the border to Arizona and then move up to the south of Utah until late Tuesday evening through Arizona.
"As a major risk in connection with Rosa or its remains, very strong rainfall is expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the southwest of the USA, which is characterized by deserts," the National Hurricane Center informed.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening flooding floods and water-driving shoes are expected in the desert as well as in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with stich wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of attempted murder.
The teen was injured on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. British summer time in the Excelsior Trade region by Midsomer Norton.
He was brought to a hospital, and his state is "stable".
According to the police of Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two-18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the wheelstock area.
The officials asked all those who have records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered 'under the community, the anger' of democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unattended tactics of the Democrats," Trump said in a statement in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered during the entire nomination process 'under the community, the anger' of the democrats.
Kavanaugh resigned to the convention on Thursday and rejected the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually harassed them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also expressed its accusation at the hearing.
On Saturday the President said that the American people had seen the brilliantness, quality and courage of Kavanaugh this day.
"A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for confirming one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the public," he said to the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our life.
I'm not going to do it, but in reality I'm going to do it," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the democrats saw their mission to "provide and block resistance".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place at the Senate at the latest on Friday, said a high staff member of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, victim numbers rising
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were flooded as a result of a strong earthquake and a tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi striking huge waves on the beaches.
On Friday, hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when, at the invasion of the darkness, waves of up to six meters high hit the beach, killing many people and destroying everything in their way.
The Tsunami had preceded an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the threat came up yesterday by the tsunami, people still went on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they fell victim to him," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Civil Protection Authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, he swimed cars, tree tribes and houses, he met everything on land," said Nugroho. He added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he met on the coast.
Some people were climbing on trees and had survived on the escape from the tsunami, he said.
Some 16.700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centres in Palu.
Air recordings published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and crashed bridges as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town was shaken by further predators.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released in the massive phenomenon of Friday was reflected in the 200 phase of energy of the nuclear bomb thrown down on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown larger, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as 'indefinite' and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were crashed.
According to his information, the bodies of some victims were found under the debris of crashed buildings. 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damages along the coast could have been higher 300 km north of Palu, in an area named Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a Declaration by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and his employees and volunteers are on the way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse," said the statement.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticized that it had not been informed that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived officially at the time of warning.
Amateur recordings published in social media show a man in the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the street under him against the close tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall on the shore forces and swimms buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not check the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
Due to the shaking and tsunami, there was a massive power failure that interrupted communication around Palu and made the authorities difficult to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending cargo aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and was opened only for relief measures.
For Sunday a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo in evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala have securely reached the city of Palu, in which the employees in tent accommodations in the courtyard of their office are housed, but, according to Dosebas, passed by scenes of devastation.
"They told them that they had seen numerous destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the auxiliary groups began with the hard task of initiating disaster aid, some confirmed that expert foreign helpers would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and staff from abroad are only possible if the location of a disaster has been declared to be the national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened until now.
"At the moment, it's another disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but this status is not valid until now.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, over Palu, friends and family members hoped to be missing for them on one of the miracles that illuminated the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was drawn from a sewage channel.
On Sunday, rescue forces liberated a woman who had been clinged up for two days under debris next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paraglider for the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Other of the prisoners in the Roa-Roa Hotel, as Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior at paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after he sent news from the crash of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders, WhatsApp news desperately to the competitors from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His news, however, led to gray question marks instead of blue hacks.
"I think that means that the news have not been sent," he said.

Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name – in Ye.
During the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has used the nickname Ye for some time and as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change precedes its appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the publication of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
It appears in the consignment as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, which, according to the producer, has failed for 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not only a shortening of its current professional name, but, according to its own, it has a religious significance for West.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘yes’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with Radio Moderator Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only’, only ‘Ye’ became – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, of everything.
The album reflects more what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West earlier, has already written his name with and without a binding and uppercase.
Mexico's AMLO promised not to fight the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador praised never to apply military violence against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country.
On Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised that "the military should never be used to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers had fired on a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people. At that time, left-handed student movements were in establishing throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador praised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training have led to criminal bands for young people.
USA should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
Given the increased activities of China in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double its research expenditure in this field, says investor and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow KI announcements of various areas of the US government, even if the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
"The double of the budget for the AI research would be a good start in view of the fact that all the other countries are behind the US so much more. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough," said Lee.
The double of the financial resources could double the chances that the next big AI success in the USA would be achieved, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest ranked American Othello player. Later he was leader of Microsoft Research and President of the Google Decree in China.
Lee appreciated previous technology competitions by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked for the date of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
After reading words, researchers in the USA often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China takes away the academic top forces, but the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up Koryphäen from universities that are supposed to work on CI in recent years.
According to Read, an amended immigration policy in the USA could also be beneficial for US AI efforts.
"I think that people promoted in the field of CI should automatically be offered Greencards," he said.
China’s State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan) in July 2017.
According to reading words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations granting money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Ministry of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to be involved in industry and science partners. In addition, the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million annually in the AI research.
In the meantime, U.S. institutions have done nothing about the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonian votes in referendum on a change in the country name
On Sunday, the population of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to ‘Northern Macedonia’, a decade-old dispute with Greece blocking the requests of Macedonia to enter the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is raised to the Greek territory. Greece has therefore put a veto against the inclusion of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June. However, nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum. A boykott campaign doubts that the vote will reach the 50 percent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the vote table was: "Are you for a membership in NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, which is the Prime Minister of Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, the inclusion in organisations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the Schirm of the European Union, as this means a safer life for us all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would comply with the result so that it is crucial.
The change in name would require a two-third majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said that there had been no reports on irregularities by 13.00 p.m.
However, the vote was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of the registered voters voting.
"I am here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will vote in Strumica, Macedonia, in the referendum on the change of the country name, which Macedonia would open the way to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, presented a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the elevated heads, not through the rear entry," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead to urgent investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be for this because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
In his words, a 'yes' result would be a 'firmification of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote with 'yes'.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the vote must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow for the prowess government's policy since its acquisition of power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvers through the entire Brighton defense to achieve gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defense at Manchester City's 2:0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his hits ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defense players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green tricots.
He played around a defender and then overcame several other defenders at the edge of the penalty of Brighton.
Then he shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penitentiary to play the ball back to Aguero, who crossed with his right shoe Brighton doorkeeper Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero fights with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We had talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he achieved a gate at this moment."
It was Sterling, however, who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier-League-Duell.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker targeted the ball in the net shortly before he slipped out.
City plays in the Champions-League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the rockies the game
Since the nationals have been excluded from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force further use.
However, the ever-performing Scherzer hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies that have a game leading to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The rockies achieved at least one wildcard with a 5:2 victory over the nationals on Friday evening, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, we can at least throw it, as we know the atmosphere of the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The nationals have not yet announced a start player for Sunday but are, according to reports, inclined to throw Scherzer in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th start player, exercised on Thursday in the  Bullpen and would throw on Sunday on his normal day of rest.
The Washington legal hand has a statistic of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 Innings.
Trump stops announcement in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in connection with the board of Kavanaugh selected for the Supreme Court when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our life.
This is one of the great, great – I don't take it, but in reality I'm going to act, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happen now.
And they are determined to take over power again with all means, you see the community, the disgusting.
It doesn't matter to them who hurt whom they have to pass over to receive the power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The democrats, he said, saw their mission in ‘to afford and block resistance’.
"And you see this in the last four days," he said and described the democrats as "wrathful and mean and disgusting and dishonest."
He called the highest democrat in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud bohrufe at the audience.
“Remember their answer?
Did you let the document get out of here?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour does not apply all opinions anymore.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Departments who are said that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had energeticly raised against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the appeal that I had a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, on similar issues, on which Jeremy with former politicians was not an opinion.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday announced that 'the meetings should all be involved and productive'.
Mostly, the Friday evening GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour Deputy were exactly that.
Today, most of the meetings have not been characterized by this sound, and the promised "friendly, humble" policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It becomes more and more clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that every opinion is assessed whether they are accepted by the party's tip.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views were now expecting me to take a turnover and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to – whether it were with regard to national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – wherever it doesn't matter what I say – a shamptirade in the social media who calls for my detachment, condemns the political center and says that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of the colleagues who face a flood of sexistic or racist malignances every day and never give a small contribution.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that migration has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn demanded last week that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we do not have any opinions any more, and with every question of mistrust and any change in the rules of election, the party becomes more enthusiastic.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to take my head and not express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have no problems.
But I didn't go into politics.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, caused by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom literally differed in the overall school, I have joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need it the most urgent – as municipal council as well as as as as cabinet ministers.
I have never made a haunt from my political views, even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unclear about my political positions and about areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday request: In view of the fact that the country is racing to a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I do not address this a message to Nottingham momentum, but to my voters, regardless of whether they are Labour Members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many threats or political intentions will not prevent me from acting in my opinion best of all of you.

Ayr against Melrose 38:17: Unbeat Ayr team rises to the top
Two late trials may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams unbeat at the table tip.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as to their better use of chances, and Trainer Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still unshaked, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Account for Ayr, they have better valued their chances than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, Melrose was able to speak the numbers due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released from the warriors for the game, and Jason Baggot caught an unincreased attempt.
Climo expanded the leadership of Ayr with a criminal step before he reached a hit directly in the mid-term and then achieved an increased attempt at all, so it was at the break 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose, however, began the second half-time well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Afterwards, there was a longer interruption due to a severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was worn by the field. After continuing, Ayr expanded his advance through an attempt by Climo by Stafford McDowall.
Then the Blair Macpherson acting as a captain of Ayr received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase, Melrose made enormous pressures pay the additional man by an unincreased attempt from Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for Tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson achieved a touchdown behind the forwarding Ayr package from the penitentiary road.
Climo increased as almost since the interruption after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's Boxkick and Flankenspieler Gregor Henry sent off for the fifth attempt of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
"Still Game" Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the guest industry after it turned out to be called the managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC broadcast, in which he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the mission, and K 00 seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Krue was interested in entering Glasgow's "florating restaurant business".
“The sea belongs to us”: the country-included Bolivia hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific
Matrosen patrol before the marine headquarters decorated with diving in La Paz.
On public buildings a lake-blue flag weighs.
Flotten support points from the Titicaca Lake to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legal property.
Recovery is a duty."
Everywhere in the country-included Bolivia, the memory of the coastal part of Chile lost in a bloody conflict on resources in the 19th century is still as alive as the desire to go back over the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as for decades since Bolivia is waiting for a judgment by the International Court of Justice to be held on 1 October after five years of discussions.
"Bolivien has the vibration, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Throughout the country, many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the IGH on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague decides in favour of Bolivia's demand. According to this, after decades of sporadic discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate on a sovereign access to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is in the next year facing a controversial struggle for his re-election, the judgment on Monday is also at stake.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court decides in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would also make little changes.
The U.N., headquartered in the Netherlands, is not authorized to speak to Chilean territory and has established that it will not decide on the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that the judgment of the IGH is already in place six months after the final plea, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, suggests that the case was 'non-complicated'.
Far from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has raised the question of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' warrior rhetoric embroidered any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue their conversations, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the judgment of the court had been extremely rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia has 'an extraordinary opportunity to bring about a new era of relations with Chile' and a chance to 'end the 139 years of disputes for mutual benefit' he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivien will never give up his right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to recognize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament only takes place if it could trust the USA
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation would never relieve its nuclear weapons first if she could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the Heads of State of the Rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be shortly opposed to reintroducing solid nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit with the North Korean Head of State Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri referred to the idea that further sanctions and the resistance of the US against a declaration of the end of the Korea war would ever force the north into the knee as a "Hirngepinst".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the declaration without taking substantial disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pjöngjang seriously refers to the refusal of an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjöngjang for next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion views in Paris show the latest collections for huge head covers that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely protect the sun, you don't have to look for any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy over-size head covers for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Very unpractical hats have flooded instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their spectacular creations over the stroll.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant coloured hat with a feather-like wide edge, which just suppressed the heads of the models.
As other overdimensional accessories, watermelons with jewellery, a magic hat and even ananas were shown. However, these are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were fitted with lips and had more similarity with Hannibal Lecter than with skin coutures.
One creation resembled a dive equipment, including snorkel and diver glass, while another looked like a melted ice suit.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Mode observers predict that the huge head covers might find their way in shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional hats follow directly “La Bomba”, the straw hat with 60 centimeters wide edge, all wearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractical hat that hit large waves into the social media sent another great creation over the treadmill: a beach pocket made of straw that was almost as large as the model of a bathing suit that held the bag.
The bast bag in reddish orange with bast franses and a white leather shirt was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' Summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris fashion week.
Prominent Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach pockets to be available in the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has been so excited that the demand for over-dimensional accessories will hardly be ignored."
John Edward: Language Knowledge for World Citizens Essential
Schottland's independent schools continue to be characterized by academic excellence. This continued with further outstanding examination results in 2018 and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sports, art, music and other Community businesses.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to maintain their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for training and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As a sector of education that can create a customized curriculum and implement it, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools as election vessels.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you get his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, then you reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year’s audits show that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the pupils who learned foreign languages achieved note A.
From the data collected by 74 SCIS member schools, 72 percent of the students in Mandarin achieved note A during the higher exams, while 72 percent of the students who learned German, 69 percent of the students who learned French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish also achieved note A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are regarded as elections today as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the teaching plans of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons that employers called for the problems of occupying open jobs were related to a lack of language knowledge.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open places require languages, these knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Depending on the job selected, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such lifelong ability.
If you can communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically give a lead to competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a good enough foreign language to conduct a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason it is important for the children of today to invest in language education now.
Children who speak several languages, in particular languages of developing countries, will have better chances to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom in terms of 2020, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever the interests of your child are, in independent schools, there will always be a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers.
Schottically independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and furnishes them with the skills necessary for their success, as the future looks like.
At this time in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be considered as 'international communication ability'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this possibility of choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut by le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James standing for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, waiting soon ends.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game of the preseason against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet firm.
"There will be more than one and less than 48", said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twittered that James will probably play a few minutes.
In the beginning of this week, James was asked after the training for his plans for the six games of the Lakers's pre-season plan.
"I do not need any pre-season games in this stage of my career to prepare myself," he said.
Time for Trumps Kundgebung in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election campaigns.
This is the first of Trump's five plans for the next week, including well-being places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the floating vote on the confirmation of his choice for the Vakanz at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections in November, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress.
When does Trump's congestion take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see online?
Trump's coinage in Wheeling, West Virginia, is planned for today, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19:00 (east coastal time).
You can track Trump's Kundgebung in West Virginia as a livestream online at YouTube.
Trump will probably address the hearings of the Board Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, to accusations of sexual misconduct that have been conducted this week in tense atmosphere. The expected senate agreement on the confirmation remains in the sweat until one week while the FBI conducts investigations.
The main objective of this series is, however, to support Republicans who have to make a difficult choice in November.
Therefore, President Trump's electoral team to Reuters suggested that these five announcements the next week serve to "mobilize volunteers and followers, while the Republicans try to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and the Representative House".
"Congress control is so important for its plans that the President will travel to as many states as possible, while the operating election season is near," said a Trump-Wahl-speaker who would not call his name to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the "Ohio and Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania" announcing pendants in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could take part in "Ohio and Pennsylvania and report media from Pittsburgh".
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to support the republic Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, in surveys.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the President has to come to try to give him up in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, Politologist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows the fighting willingness to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three single-sided rounds, the four parties may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging pendulum of the momentum is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one in which the players really believe, and that especially in competitions like this.
So where is the momentum of their opinion now?
"They were in leadership with six points, and now it's four, so I think that means a little moment for us," said Jordan Spieth when leaving the place of play.
Europe is of course in the advantage and has four points ahead, while twelve others follow.
However, the Americans, according to Spieth, feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show three of four points each.
Spieth was extremely strong from down to green and goes forward with a good example.
The well-tural enthusiasm screams became louder in the further course of his round, when he lowered an important Putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both, after he and Thomas had relocated after two holes with two points.
His Putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for them, triggered a similar scream that suggests that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"I really have to knock in and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have achieved more points than Spieth and Thomas as the only player in the last two days and thus undoubtedly write the story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's uneven, but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and cannot make anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple that had not hit Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine holes on Friday morning Bogeys.
This series and the seemingly between them and the exhausted amount of flowing energy undermines that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who seal a possible European victory when the sun falls over Le Golf National.
Preferably both on different holes at the same time.
Speaking of European glory, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the four hero of the morning who played with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spanish and Sweden into a terminal that they could not almost overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the clamp.
The four and four pairs are so fascinating from nearby because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or do not, and the way in which a strategy can quickly change.
The Europeans have played better as a team until now and are clearly in leadership on the last day. However, this four-round has also shown that the U.S. team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, had doubted.
Europe is leading the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is in front of the United States after the four-parties and four-parties from Saturday with 10:6 and goes with a solid advance to the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The ingenious Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went forward with two victories over the difficult tiger woods and was able to book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the four in the morning compared to the defective American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the United States was more opposed and won two matches, but the residue could not be recovered.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve individuals played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood, the first European newling, won four points in succession, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend "Molliwood", won four points in their four opening matches only as a second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After they hit Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized excellently and struck the enchanted Woods and the American Neuling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who had slipped through two matches on Saturday, occasionally made his brilliant lightning, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four parties and seven in succession.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played the four parties as a partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris did not run everything according to their ideas.
The three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the mess for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a tough 2 & 1 victory in the fours over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-party 4 & 3 after they had lost the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it was only twice that a team came back after it had gone into the single with a backdrop of four points. However, as a title holder, Furyk's team has a choice to keep the trophy.
After they have been in second place for two days, it doesn't look like they could start a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
On Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister told the United Nations that continuing sanctions would deepen their mistrust to the United States and that the country would not give up its nuclear weapons by any means unilaterally under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the Annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "essential measures" last year. For example, it stopped nuclear and rocket tests, demolished nuclear testing grounds and committed itself not to increase nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We see, however, no corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the USA, there is no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances we will not first rely on one side."
While Ri trusted North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a 'phase-wise' approach in denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant when it did not reject a one-sided denuklearization from before, as Pjöngjang had done in the past.
Ri pointed to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an official US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In this, Kim had assured that the 'deluculearization of the Korean peninsula' would work, while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is aiming for an official end of the Korea war led from 1950 to 1953, while the United States said that Pjöngjang had to give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposes demands for a loosening of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States consists of "first denuklearization" and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve their goal by force and even against the "Declaration of the End of War", said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into the knees is a brain spin of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not refer to plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of State had highlighted at the beginning of the week with the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Head of State Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea would be the other party in the denuclearization issue instead of the USA, it would not have come to this silence when the Korean peninsula was deuclearized."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris speech was enormously different from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles to the mainland of the USA after "the evil president" called Trump Kim on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened with the “full destruction” of North Korea last year, lobbed Kim with the United Nations for his courage in the process of disarmament. He said, however, that there was still a lot of work to do and that the sanctions should remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he has no time frame for it: "Whether it lasts two years, three years or five months – plays no role."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pjöngjang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must definitely continue to be strongly until we have reached complete, final and verified denuklearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to dry Pjöngjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes financially.
Pompeo met Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjöngjang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, at the departure from Pjöngjang, he said that progress had been made to be accused of only hours later by North Korea that he had made 'previous claims'.
North Korea praised this month at a meeting with Moon, demolishing a rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took 'according measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'according measures' aimed at being security guarantees that Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at the University of Harvard ensures that all students get more sleep in the basic study this year. This is a measure against the widespread Macho culture of keeping up with caffeine and learning all night.
A scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention to themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, and was according to his opinion the first such course in the USA.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I only learn about it now, in my last year?’
In her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, and that surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The first course this year explained to the students how the foundations of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve the general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep withdrawal during the week.
The one hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the students see the image of a room in a home and click on coffee bags, curtains, training shoes and books. They receive information about the effect of caffeine and light, as well as about the effects of lack of sleep on the sports performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged to think about their daily routine with the help of a map of the university site with interactive symbols.
“We know that students’ behaviour will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a night layer is still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the constantly increasing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
Enough to ensure good sleep, the 'secret weapon' of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, a weight increase was avoided, as sleep withdrawal turns the brain into hunger mode so that they were constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. Last year he had one of his courses in Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push to a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar study programme before they take up their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, the students should have a clock for sleeping time and awakening time and be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' that comes from electronic screens and LED lightings and can bring the circadian rhythm out of the clock. This leads to problems in sleeping.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor convinced Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another outward game when the hit of Dolly Menga for Steven Gerrard's unanimous team meant a 0:1 low position at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book its first outward victory at St. Johnstone since the 4-1 Triumph, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard the first second defeat in 18 games as a manager, so his team relies eight points behind the premiership of the Ladbroke.
Menga met seven minutes before the mid-term, and the inspirational poor Rangers seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers fall to the sixth place now, Livingston rises to the third place and lies only behind Hibernian at the Tordifferenz.
The Rangers also threaten further anger, after liner Calum Spence had to be treated because of a head wound by an apparently thrown object from the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, the Ayr obsolete and reached the half-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players who took the hearts a point last week, and would have to be enthusiastic about how his well-trained team kept their opponents on step and tread.
The Rangers dominated the ball ownership, but Livingston reached more if they had the ball.
After only two minutes they should have reached a gate when Mengas first delivered Scott Pittman to Allan McGregors gate. However, the middle field player missed his chance and shot.
Then a long release from Keaghan Jacobs reached the captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot by the back of the pens.
The Rangers took control, but their game worked more hopefully than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos obviously felt that after a quarter hour he should have been confronted by a collision between Steven Lawless and Steven Lawless, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not apply the complaints of the Colombian.
In the first half of the season, the former Ibrox-Torhüter Liam Kelly had hardly difficulty with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a narrow shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hits may not match the game in the 34th minute, it is not to be denied that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers could not deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the rest and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted in the mid-term and pushed Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediate effect when the wing player put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly raided from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to play exactly the game they were lying, with Lithgow and Halkett received one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded her leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stopped well and resisted Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also demanded a late criminal offense after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson saw away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the violin counter
And now a page from our “Sunday Morning” Almanach: On 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, future physicist John Wilhelm “Hans” violin was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of identifying and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as a violin counter.
Since then, the violin counter has become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: “This is a violin counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “I do, I'm listening to a boy.”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name remains.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' decorated cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy degraded cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect degraded cells as part of the treatment.
The method is used to extract immune cells that are modified in the laboratory.
These cells can see a lot of cancers common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system is decorated cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is used to collect immune cells that are modified in the laboratory in such a way that they can “see” the many types of cancer common protein HER2. The cells are then again injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, egg stock, lungs and intestine cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells has helped in treating leukaemia.
After his appearance at SNL, Kanye West released a Pro Trump Tyre and wore a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was buried in the studio at Saturday Night Live after he had proclaimed far-slow US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to join as presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title, "Ghost Town", and carrying a make-America-Great-Again cap, he continued with a shimp canonade against the democrats and stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the mission with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywoodstar made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Justice Committee on the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of Wests Schimpfirade was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by comicer Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had difficulties behind the stage because of his head coverage.
“They shaken me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go out with the cap."
You shaken me!
And then they say I found myself in a falling area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Would you see the shaken area?" He said he would be dressing "my supermancape, because that means that you can't tell me what I have to do. You want to go ahead with the world?
Try with love."
His remarks triggered at least twice the audience, and SNL-members were embarrassingly touched, reported Variety. One person said to the magazine: "It was still dead in the studio."
West had been obliged to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many with a lecture of the title "I Love it", in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the Conservative Group TPUSA. She twittered: "To one of the most courageous spirits: DANKE, THAT YOU HAVE THE MASSE ENTGEESTED."
However, the Talkshow Moderator Karen Hunter twittered that West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes a harmful ideology to my community and gives himself (by buying his music or his clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same is true of us," she added.
Before the shipment, the Rapper had announced at Twitter that he had changed his name and now was “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His Rapper College Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the deceased music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" (the former Prince-known artist).

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington attacks toxic males
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword swinging Jon Snow in HBOs by violent medieval fantasy series 'Game of Thrones'.
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of Machoheld. He said that such roles on the screen would have resulted in the feeling that boys often had to be strong to be respected.
In the conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said that he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculine in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also involved in 'Game of Thrones', also 31 years ago, admitted that he was the solution to the problem 'very important'.
"I personally think the question is very important at present what has been wrong with maleness," he said.
'What have we taught rising men about the problem that we are now observing?'
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculineity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that boys feel like having to embodie this particular side of a man?
I think that is really one of the great questions of our time: How do we change that?
For with the young men something has clearly gone wrong."
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series, he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of 'Game of Thrones' after the end of the summer. He had 'good of battlefields and horses'.
From November onwards, Harington can be seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the history of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he had been the best in 'Game of Thrones' for him that he had met his wife Rose.
"I have met my wife in this mission, so in this way I have received my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslies family affairs in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Contrary to the past, the transfer took place in the majority of the new cases through sex.
HIV has been rapidly spread in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV had been almost reduced to zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In the year's comparison, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination between LGBT community members should be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men were finally marrying women.
Many of the disease transfers are due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised, inter alia, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters contends that employees have allowed the data of the GOP senators to search, criticizes "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, Member of the U.S. Representatives' House, argued on Saturday that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MEPs.
The democrats from Los Angeles believed that the claims of “ultraright-oriented” experts and websites would be disseminated.
"Learning, lies and even more horrible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information should contain the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of an Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual infringements of an unknown person in the government district against the Supreme Curt candidates Brett Kavanaugh.
The publication took place after the three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the contributions, was Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," said Waters.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for the searching of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly triggered criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This dementi is angry," wrote Fleischer.
“This concludes that she does not have the right temper to be a Congress member.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
They must not be disdainful.
You may not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They must be quiet and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the criticism of the democrats to judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of acting angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who joins the mid-term elections to solve waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that is true," he twittered.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the offenders are revealed," she continued, "and that they are drawn to account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for all the members of my staff."
Criticism about "Johnny English – Man lives only three times" – weak spy parodie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in any British-coloured new film. This seems also to apply for this revival of the "Johnny English" action comodition, which started with "Johnny English – The Spion that revived it" in 2003, and in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now just right."
Is an ironic self-parody about the subject of how we are obviously insulted to be a new export chance for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glowing, grimasciating and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comical creation for cinema visitors in the non-English room.
Of course, he is again the confused secret agent, who bizarrely thinks himself cool and world-wide, while, in reality, he has contributed from something clouseau, a prize Mr. Bean and a lacquer of this burst, which at the opening celebration of the 2012 Olympic Games in London has contributed a single note to the title melodie of “The Hour of Winner”.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos of travellers and international secret agents who played Atkinson in the now forgotten barclaycard spots.
Johnny English's last adventure has one or two nice moments.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor leaves stabbed shortly to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comic occurs, but the humor seems quite weak and strangely obscure, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" meanwhile offer self-sufficient comicing elements.
The humor seems to be more addressed to children than to adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy misbehavior is not as intriguing and focused as Atkinson's stupid film gag in the role of Bean.
The Eternal Premises is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker infiltrated the supersecret British spionage network and revealed the identity of all British agents in use, very to the failure of the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, a blasted and impressed figure that is already ahead of the complete collapse because of her political impopularity: Emma Thompson gives with this quasi-Teresa May-Character her best, but the script does not give much to work with
Their secret service advisors inform them that all active spiders have been detached and therefore need to get someone out of retirement.
This also includes the tolpatschige Johnny English himself, who is now working as a teacher at an emerging institution, but is unofficial teaching in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spionage academy reminiscent of “School of Rock”.
English will be brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested Kupan Bough, who is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-Boot commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a little vain.
So Batman and Robin, who in the secret service of your Majesty always make everything terribly wrong, are back into action. They meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful femme Fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister becomes dangerous in the ban of a charismatic tech billionary, Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of the UK.
English and Bough start their Odyssee of the great fun: As a cellar they dress a nice French restaurant in fire, they care for chaos as they smuggle on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house using a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the topic is already discussed in the children's television in detail.
Very moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself: “Cann’t the British film industry Rowan Atkinson give a role that really meets his talent?”
Labour affairs to work on a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan that presupposes that the British work four days a week but are paid for five days.
The party claims that managers of the company share the savings generated by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to the workers.
This means that employees would have a three-day weekend but would still receive the same payment.
According to the sources, the idea of the Party's economic agenda and its plans to move the balance in the country for the benefit of the workers.
The changeover to a four-day week was supported by the Trades Union Congress as the opportunity for workers to use the benefits of the changing economy.
A high - ranking source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “A directive examination is expected before the end of the year.
'A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that corresponds to the party's approach to the recovery of the economic balance for workers and to the general industrial policy strategy of the Party.'
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party is currently not in favour of the overall approach.
A speaker of the Labour Party informed: "There is no party policy for a four-day week and it is not considered by the Party."
Shadow Chanceller John McDonnell conceived his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy last week at the Labour Conference.
McDonnell said he was firmly determined to recover the power of 'anonym directors' and 'profitmakers' in public supply companies.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retain their entire share, as a Labour Government could make 'deducts' due to supposed misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to call workers to the boards of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees, collecting annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy commented in the newsmagazin "60 minutes" whether the investigation of the FBI in the case of Kavanaugh could change its opinion
The FBI investigation on the accusations against Richter Brett Kavanaugh postponed a final agreement on his appointment to the Judge at the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Republican Senators Authority could influence to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60 Minutes Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could show something, which could eventually change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I told in the trial that I had spoken to judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, that claim was expressed, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and indispensable."
But Graham's voice seems to be blended in stone.
"My opinion is firm as to Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to burst a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Board has disputed this," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all who they called could not confirm it."
It's now 36 years.
And I can't find any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has been contributed to reducing poverty in the context of this festival?
This Saturday, in New York, the Global Citizen Festival will take place to fight an annual music festival with an impressive lineup on stars and a similarly impressive mission – poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place for the seventh time this year, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to intensify the awareness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place in 2012 for the first time, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group tries to fight poverty by motivating more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteer work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal of combating poverty.
How successful is the project when one considers that Global Citizen remains 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of looking forward to a cool free concert a meaningful way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think to change something by signing an online petition or sending a Tweet?
Global Citizen noted that since 2011 the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions by its supporters and achieve different goals.
These actions should have contributed to stimulating world leaders to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least 10 billion US dollars have already been paid or received by Fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the guaranteed funds have a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important obligations are the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom, who have committed to supporting children in their optimal development and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million to fight undernourishment in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of underfood a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, informed the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also noted that after more than 5,000 actions which were called on to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the project The Power of Nutrition, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, the question of what are the reasons why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
they replied: “It will be a long and hard path with heights and depths.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will have success, as we are together stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who take place at this year's event in New York. Also with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as fashion consultants.
The US could use the Navy for blockades to hinder Russian energy exports – Interior Ministry
According to Washington Examine, Washington can react to the Navy if needed, so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, the US Minister Ryan Zinke informed.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is a pretext for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legal government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for the use of Russia in the Middle East is the negotiation of new market markets in energy, just as in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to do this.
"The United States can, together with the Navy, ensure that the sea roads remain open and block them if necessary in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he informed.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group, which understands itself as the "stimm of electricity consumers" in the USA.
He made a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he described Russia as "One trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was expanding the export of liquid gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump themselves, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unreasonable" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became the "Feeding" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Nord Stream 2-pipeline is worth $11 billion, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to be 110 billion cubic meters, which is an exclusively economic project.
The Kreml argues that the massive resistance of Washington to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exercising pressure and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said the Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The USA has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has asked the USA to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a major problem if a third country is interfering with our energy supply," says BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to ‘examine’ a presidential candidate in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
On Saturday, the Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced that she would ‘examine’ a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a Town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she considered a candidateship.
According to The Hill Warren, it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to 'examine precisely' a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump leads this country into the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy," she said.
Warren did not take a leaf to her mouth when she criticized Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a Tweet on Friday she announced that a FBI examination is of course necessary before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of the Warren voters do not believe that it should be candidate for 2020.
According to the survey of Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts claimed that the Senator should not compete.
32 percent of the voters supported such a candidateship.
The survey showed more support for a candidate for the former governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent who support a potential candidate and 48 percent that are against it.
Among the other names of prominent democrats, which are eligible for a possible candidateship in 2020, former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders are among them.
According to Associated Press, Biden informed him that he would decide officially by January.
Sarah Palin expresses himself on the Donald Trump-Ralley to posttraumatic stress disorder, under which track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening.
"What my son perceives what he is going through when he comes back, what other families can feel like, feeling the effects of the PTBS and a part of the wounds with which our soldiers return," she told the audience at a ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as 'elephant in space' and said about her son and other war veterans that they came back changed, that they came back to the brave, that they came back and wondered if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military gave to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, says Dannett, a spokesman of the police authority of Wasilla.
18 States and D.C. support a legal aid to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal aid to the new US policy that refuses victims of band activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District submitted a jurisdiction-declaration in Washington on Friday in order to support an asylum applicant who challenges politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace-gegen-session complaint submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not announced.
She informed that her partner, 'and his violent band sons', abused them, but US officials rejected their asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace referred to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people make a request for asylum in the United States, as nations who are facing major problems with criminal bands and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy abolished a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014 allowing illegal immigrants to request asylum on the run from domestic violence.
The Federal Advocate General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “Isnteenths of legislation at state, state and international level” was ignored.
‘The Federal Law stipulates that all asylum applications are assessed based on the respective facts and circumstances of the application and that court violates this principle’ was stated in the Court of First Instance.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that policies that immigrants refuse access to the country have an unfavourable impact on the economy in the US, as immigrants could be more active as entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary workers.
In June, Jeff Sessions General Federal Prosecutor ordered that immigration victims who flee from domestic violence and the violence of criminal bands should no longer grant asylum.
"Asyl is available for all who leave their home country because they are persecuted or from fear due to racial, religious, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," said Sessions in his announcement of politics of 11 June.
It was never the plan to uncover all the problems by granting asylum, even all serious problems people face every day worldwide.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles by time
For survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It's all very tense," says the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma and calms her little feathering son in a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to gather their most nested possessions and goods and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of hospitals who were damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5 were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured ones, including Dwi Haris, who drove up breaches and a broken shoulder, remained outside the military hospital of Palu, where patients in the outdoor area were treated because of the persistent strong post-shakes.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the fierce earthquake shaken the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“ Everything went too fast.
I think I was stuck under the invaded walls," he reported the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“ I heard my wife’s help calls, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
US Ambassadors charged tyranny with “Propaganda Advertising”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper had placed a four-sided display in an American newspaper, in which the mutual advantages of trade between the USA and China were announced, the US ambassadors in China accused the capital of Beijing to exploit the American press for progaganda purposes.
United States Donald Trump was referring last Wednesday to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of mixing into the United States convention elections on 6 November, a charge against China.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere with the U.S. elections correspond to the communication of US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn advertisements on the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an outward trade war, with duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retribution duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassadors in China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, who exports agricultural products to China, informed that Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and companies.
China, says Branstad in a position in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now double this tyranny by activating propaganda advertisements in its own free press in the USA.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the tradition of free expression and independent press in America by switching the country's paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast to this, you will find only in limited numbers of oppositions in Beijing on newspaper skiosks and do not find any real reflection of the different opinions the Chinese might have about the disturbing economic development of China, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer for the publication of his article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans pretend to voters before the interim elections with the debakel around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several offences of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the forthcoming intergovernmental elections, which could be especially from women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already indicated that they continue with a vote.
“These things can’t be reversed,” explained Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of the Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that the last minute incident of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was sufficient for an FBI investigation to sensitize angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning demonstrators called “November is coming” in the hallway of the Senate, when the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to hold the nomination of Kavanaughs and that, despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an inpartial political observer of the news page.
“The people say it is already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially in the suburbs and in the younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the President, often do not choose."
Even before the public statement of Fords, in which their accusations of sexual attack against the candidates of the Supreme Court, were detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could result if the Republicans prioritized the confirmation.
"This situation is a tremendous deal for the GOP," said NBC News, Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee.
"It is not only about the vote of the Board, the final vote or the review of Kavanaugh's; it is also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of democrats, the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be disagree with whom they should believe due to the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were definitively or likely convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they gave Kavanaugh faith definitively or probably.
38% also indicated that they believe that Kavanaugh probably or definitively lied to his statement, while 30% reported the same about Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford and at least one other applicant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an edict declaration last week before the Senate's Judicial Committee that it was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had dismissed her genetics when they were at a party during her study period in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans the launch of a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, currently brings a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee gave the best idea that the intention behind Inrupt was the 'world domination'.
"We need to be active now," he said on startup.
'It is a historical moment.'
The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, tasks lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and business sector.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content are available in a browser and at the same time.
The special feature of the personal online data storage is that the user alone can decide who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal strengthening and development on data.
According to the CEO of the company John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate abilities to ensure that Solid is available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been set up for work on this project, as well as a community volunteer programmer. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee informed that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made, in which their entire business models are completely redesigned overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a media contribution published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berner-Lee has been significantly involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, the leader of the Viktoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Viktoria Cross during World War I, was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Oberstleutnant and priest Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 due to his use in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a shaft protector and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandsons revealed a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroes act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918 Oberstleutnant Vann led his Bataillon over the Canal de Saint-Quentin, through dense fog and under severe fire of field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he pushed forward to the fire line and led the line forward with the “greatest trembling” before hurrying forward with a field weapon in the single entrance and switching out three of the military units.
On October 4, 1918, Oberstleutnant Vann was shot by a German shielder; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's deeds were something he could never do, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid a crane after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann indicated that he was very honoured to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the pamperability of a real hero becomes particularly visible by the support of many people.
MMA fans have stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine that you've stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The bill of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom to channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, the audience in the United Kingdom were not astonished as suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained unaffected after they stayed awake until the early morning hours to see the battle specifically.
A fan described the change to the trick film figure on Twitter as a somewhat bad joke.
"On the basis of a regime by the government, these content are classified as non-punctual, so that it had to be switched to a child's broadcast at 6 p.m.," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the field of marketing and communication at Bellator when he was asked for the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The Executive Board at Bellator, Scott Coker, informed that the company will process the process plan to take into account viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think that the problem could have been solved during the repetition game," he said.
“But it’s 6 o’clock in the morning at a Sunday with the viewers in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay there.
During the change, quite much was communicated. It was very nice and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and we have assumed that it is a technical disturbance.
What wasn't the case, it was a problem of the government.
I promise that this will not happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in normal case, and we have tried to offer the fans best experiences.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'submit' on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who took part in various Olympic games as a water jumper, says that he grew up with the feeling of being submissive of all others because of his sexuality, but this feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at the secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he has spoken about the issue of Schwulenrechte in order to encourage others.
He also said since he became father, the victory in the Olympic Games is no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses disease condition for a few months.
In Laverne's first mission, he said that he used to view himself as inferior in comparison to others, as love for boys and girls was totally unacceptable.
He said: "Today it is the feeling of being submissive and different from the others, reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-fold bronze medal winner in the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and has used its appearance at the this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to promote the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he has expressed himself on this subject because he can happily live without restrictions and without discrimination and want to encourage others.
The three-fold world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The knowledge of in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner in the previous year, but he shared that the age difference had never been a topic.
He thinks that if one had to endure so much as a child and adolescent – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have a son who has been named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley thinks that his whole vision has changed since then.
Last year, he'd have turned everything around gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympia Gold Medaillen.
His son Robbie is now his main gain.
He has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father didn't accept the close death, and one of the last things he asked for were the tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be in front of it.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only afterwards I finally realized that he was not invincible," he continued.
In 2012, Daley won the bronze medal in the Olympic Games.
"I only knew that it was always my dream of diving in Olympic games before local audiences – that was the madness," he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced. He heard the song in front of the Olympic Games and still cared for gänsehaut.

Mickelson, currently not in form, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must make a great effort so that it doesn't become a debakel.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the event, the five-fold Major victors spent his day putting others on fire and working on his game in the hope of fixing the problems that burden him.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misleaded balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself was not discouraging enough, Mickelson met in the ninth game on Sunday on the perfectionist British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, Neuling in these tournaments to win all four games this week.
If the Americans have four points behind the 12 single games, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
"He was perfectly clear about his role today, gave me a clip on my back and put his arm around me and meant he's ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is one of the world's well-known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I wouldn't have thought he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it's been, and that's what we've expected.
He wants to be there like anyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most of the Ryder Cup games performed on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup driveway that never matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 victories, had to set up 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk told that his presence alone has enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, originally and likes to make a couple of fun, and he's a great person who's popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to meet him a little closer this week. It was fun to watch them.
He is a truly interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can be over with the jump soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advance that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a jump of five points towards the Americans, but only came over the target line and went into leadership with the smallest possible advance and a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The idea remains that we had a great jump in Valderrama, we had a great jump in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we have won, but that's just scarce," said Bjørn (pictured in the photo), after he had seen the victory 5–3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all team members that it's not over.
Tomorrow it's going right.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is over only when the points are on the display board.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and just there is our focus.
I've always said I've been concentrating on the 12 players on our side, but we're fully aware of what is standing against us on the other hand: the best players in the world."
Bjorn continued to say: “I would never overtake it.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow, individual services are in the foreground, and this is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things run well, but if you're out there alone, you'll be tested as a golfer up to the limits of your abilities.
You need to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also needs to get the best out."
Unlike Bjorn, his versus Jim Furyk will make sure that his players cut out better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that big turning on the last tournament day. He stood in Brookline on the winner side before he stood on the side of the losers after Europe's "Wonder of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question like Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum strikes in a direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send out our boys as we feel, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to pick up for the counter, he had to join the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as another European in the upper half of the ranking list.
"I have decided for the boys in this order, as I believe it covers everything," said Bjorn about his choice for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship retarded
The latest fregatte of the German Navy should have been put in service in 2014 to replace warships coming in the years from the Cold War. However, according to local media it is delivered due to defective systems and rapidly growing costs only early next year.
The operation of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the headship of the brand-new fregattes of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that called for a military speaker.
The ship should have been employed in 2014, but the ambitious project had been plagued by disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were already ordered by the Marine in 2007, are to replace the old fregats of the Bremen class.
They should include a powerful canon, a number of flight defence missiles and sea destination aircraft, as well as Tarn technologies such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest fregats do not have to return to their homes for up to two years.
The persistent delays, however, may lead to the obsoleteness of the modern warships that are supposed to represent Germany as a sea force at the time of their commissioning, says The Time.
Fregatte F125, who was persecuted by the calamity, went to the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the yard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship after its delivery to the shipyard.
There was little known about the reasons for returning, but German media called a number of major ‘software and hardware errors’ that would have made the new ship unusable in a fighting situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 metres, only half as many as on the older fregats of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too heavy, which leads to performance losses and prevents the marine from carrying out retrofitting measures in the future.
The 7000 tonnes heavy Rhineland-Palatinate was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, became a problem.
Apparently, costs rose to a breathtaking € 3.1 billion, compared to €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest fregats are particularly significant in view of the recent warnings that the power of the sea of Germany is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, German Federal Representative, confirmed that the Navy “going out the operative ships”.
Bartels said that the problem grew over time, since old ships were taken out of service but no substitute ships were provided.
He complained that none of the fregattes of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the Marine.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research works are being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will enable further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help to guide future natural protection activities.
The study conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will detect dwarf and mucous bats as well as the brown Langohr and water fledermuses in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
During a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of fledermaus calls is determined and determines what species do.
Afterwards, a map and a report of the habitat are created to create a detailed picture of its behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Protection Adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will show what areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of the measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and to demonstrate how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
The stocks of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to a loss of living space.
Wind wheels and lighting can also pose a risk as well as flyers and the chemical treatment of construction materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Fledermuses are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful due to their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a filthy echo to detect insects and obstacles in their airway.
The NTS responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the theme of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who carry out regular investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only fledermausreservate in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Goods Manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for her.
"Here in Threave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there is much we don't know about bats yet, so here and on other goods we will carry out these works that will help us to learn more about what bats need to feel well."
He emphasizes the importance of excluding the presence of bats from maintenance work in the goods first, since it is possible that the impersonal destruction of a single nest place could kill up to 400 females and young animals and eliminate the entire population on the ground.
Fledermuses are under protection and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nest places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: "We still need to learn much about bats and in many of our species we don't know how it is about their populations."
Ronaldo disputes rape claims, while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape accusations against him "fact news" and said that people would like to be "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine The mirror that published the accusations.
The storm of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It was said that he paid her $375,000 to buy her silence to the incident, according to The mirror on Friday.
In an instagram live video of its 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their publication as "Fake News".
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the balloon d’Or in the camera.
“You want to profile yourself by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror because of the accusations they referred to as 'inadmissible reporting on suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for “moral damage at a level that corresponds to the severity of the infringement of law, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was supposed to take place in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After they met in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went into the player's room, where, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, he presumably raped them anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to her knees after the alleged incident and she said that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was "a percentage".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it was unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later entered into an extra-judicial agreement, since she had "anxiety to retaliation" and was concerned to be "publicly degraded".
The 34-year-old said that they are now trying to remove the agreement, as it was still traumatized because of the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged incident, Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid and changed to the Italian Giant Juve in a 100 million euros deal.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘return’ the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would be “rejoicing forever” if, after Brexit, it lost its status as a world-leading manufacturer of cars, Mr. Greg Clark, said.
He continued to say that it was “anxious” that Toyota UK told the BBC that production in the plant in Burnaston at Derby would prematurely be interrupted, the UK should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border on a no-deal broxit could lead to job loss.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota's product lines are produced Auris and Avensis, manufactured almost 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience production stops in our work at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also caused fears of a harsh EU exit without agreement and their influence on cross-border trade.
BMW says, for example, that it will close his mini-work in Oxford after the Brexit for a month.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, are linked with risks within the supply chain with a hard Brexit.
Toyota's production plant is operated on a “Just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered from both the United Kingdom and the EU every 37 minutes to manufacture cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, the limits could be interrupted which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortcomings in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to carry out a stock in Derbyshire, which exceeded a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU “is precisely designed to avoid such controls at the border”.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I said, allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take this opportunity," he explained in the BBC Radio broadcast Today 4.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not specify how long production should be interrupted, but in the long run warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been busy in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest functioner of the Unite Association in the work, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience never returned these jobs once they are gone.
One government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be postponed “by another week”, while the dispute for the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, said it from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has supervised the work of the special investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates the election interferences by Russia, connections between Trump's consultants and Russia, as well as a possible legal disability by the President.
The question whether Trump would fire the Vice Justice Minister and thus endanger Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of a secret recording of his discussions with Trump and the president's official release by means of the 25th constitutional addition.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his supposed resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was at the time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump explained that he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to prevent it from colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate's judicial committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had challenged him sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
On a question of meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for it. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, in view of all the things that are just going ahead with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably object to this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference of the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her for the reason.
Sanders explained that the small frequency of the press conferences does not give rise to a disregard against the 'effect-hassery' of the TV reporters, but admitted: "I wouldn't deny that they operate effective harassment."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President makes more question and answer rounds than any President before him," she said without any evidence: "We have seen these figures."
Press conferences will still be held, says Sanders, but if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States but is far better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do this often, and you have seen that we have often done this in the last few weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he took a bizarre appearance from the row before collected reporters.
Health Minister writes on account of the Brexit considerations to EU employees of the Scottish NHS
The Minister for Health is addressed to people from the EU-Austria who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the gratitude of the country and to express the desire that they remain in the country after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared ready to carry the costs of requests for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued during the summer, and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the disturbing times that must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express again how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of health services and thus benefit from patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Aberrombie was subjected to an emergency surgery after a head injury
The linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie, according to data from Mike Organ of Tennessee State, was undergoing an emergency operation on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, Chief Trainer of Tennessee State, explained that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainer and medical staff provided butcrombie on the side line with oxygen before he was placed on a wearing and transported for further investigations.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville,Tennessee that Abercrombie left the OP at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "not yet any details of the type or extent of injury" are known and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Butrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays at Tennessee State in his first season after he changed from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, rising to 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for property purchase in the United Kingdom
For the purchase of property in the United Kingdom, foreign investors will have to impose higher stamp taxes in the future and additional revenue will benefit from the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This step will end the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in stamp fee will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects more than 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce that foreign investors have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with the need to benefit more homeless people.
This step is an attempt to inhibit Jeremy Corbyn's success in young voters who promises to provide more affordable living space and to take top earners into the visa.
The increase in stamp tax is levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional revenue is to be paid to the government campaign against homelessness.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the two years ago introduced increase to two apartments and homes left for rent could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the step with increased revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 percent newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not located in the United Kingdom. This increases prices and makes it more difficult for first buyers to walk in the real estate business.
Many wealthy areas in the country, especially in the capital, became “spirit cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows just a few weeks after Boris Johnson has pronounced a reduction in stamp tax in order to allow more young people to the first home.
He accused builders of keeping up the real estate prices by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments in order to end Britain's "scalling space".
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a striking series of proposals for housing reforms, ranging from a rental price commitment to the prohibition of remembrances without a trifly reason.
He also wants to grant city councils more powers in building new apartments.
May explained: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream, according to which life should be improved from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be correct for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies with a foreign headquarters, to buy property as well as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too remote for too many people and the invaluability of homelessness remains an too big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that it is his ‘highest goal’ to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old shooter enjoys the challenge to embrace the club from the north-east of England, which stands on the third place in the League One and lacks the three points at the top.
He moved to the stage of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I managed to go to the bank and that was 's," Ross told the broadcast Sports sound from BBC Scotland.
“But as a child, I have often seen Scotland play with my father in Hampden, and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I had been successful in association management."
Ross predecessor in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Chief of Alloa Athletic indicated that he was not afraid to join the footsteps of such established names in such a club after he previously refused to offer Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured with me at the moment by whether I can return the club to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities in this association, he is unquestionably part of the Premier League," he explained.
"It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only appreciate my time here as a success if I brought the club back there."
Ross can present a first three-year management career, after a phase as deputy boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month work as a trainer in Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the margin of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says that he feels better now than ever before in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"That was probably a real separation," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds funny because I didn't make myself bad, could live well and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you need to endure every week.
I still do this through the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now I do it. I never felt so well in my skin throughout my life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30, according to a study
The heat wave in summer has missed the revenue of the UK's crushing pubs, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded a 2.7 percent turnover growth in July. However, the revenue in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA company consultancy, which compiled the figures, explained: “Leveling sunshine and England’s long-term participation in the football world championship meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, in which Pub’s turnover increases of 2.8 percent.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars focusing on beverages showed by far the best performance, with a surface-adjusted turnover development, which rose higher than at restaurants.
Pubs with focus on foods also suffered in the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to go to a drink.
In the Pubs and Bars managed, the consumption of beverages increased by 6.6 percent per month, while the sale of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the analysts for the RSM recreation and restaurant industry, explained: “These results continue the trend we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sports events remain the largest factors for the sales in the out-of-Home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but turnover losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the persistent cost pressure.
The long, hot summer couldn't have come at any worse time for operators of companies focusing on food, and it remains waiting for the more moderate temperatures in August to provide the urgently needed atempause."
The total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the Pub, Bar and Restaurant area in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from his parents
One study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools has found an increase in so-called 'Fake Insta' pages
The message fires fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a 'main account' to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase of so-called 'Fake Insta' accounts, a reference to the Photo Sharing website Instagram.
The message fires fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a clean 'main account' that they can show their parents, but also own private accounts.
One mother who found on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked others to "rape me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes 'stimm of athletes' in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as non-executive member of the Council of the Scottish Athletics Association of Light Athletics at its annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most excellent light athlete and the chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity to benefit from its extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the Leichtathletik Community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that light athletics in Scotland would benefit very much from their choice in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as an athlete's voice and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance of over 200 and 400 meters at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, called a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and today often appeared as BBC experts, could no longer run after a transient transfusion disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can say whether or how far I'm going to cure.
It was hard work, but I have recovered myself completely, have learned to run again and today do movement exercises!
Thank you very much for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps comparing mothers with cows ensures excitement in the network
A dairy pump manufacturer in the net ensured excitement with a advertising clip in which breast-feeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
In order to introduce the market, according to the self-employed 'in the world's first noise-drawing milk pump', the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie published a music video that is not very seriously meant to emphasize the freedom that gives the pump soothing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cow-filled with cows in the background to a song that contains text lines like: "Yes, I milk, but you don't see me a cock" or "if you have not noticed it, these are not Euters but my breasts."
The Refrain continues: "Pumpe it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has triggered a controversy in the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video found on mixed reactions among the audiences, many of whom say that it perseveres the "horror" of the milk industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply this product with cows.
As we do, they must become powerful and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within a few days after birth," said a comment.
The milk pump of Elvie fits dementia to a breast-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “That is traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This is a realistic advertising."
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that you found the song 'urcomical'.
"I think that's a genius idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a genius product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: "This is a funny advertising addressed to mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an advertising for or against the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that all have danced with the discrete pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women using milk pumps indicate that they feel like milk cows.
Elvie’s pump, however, is completely noise-free, has no wires or snails and fits discreetly into a breast-BH, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even exit during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The pump of Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserves a dared and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with milk cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the related challenges and at the same time in a more entertaining and refining manner, representing the incredible sense of freedom that enables the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump got into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared a double mother on the catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were brought quietly and quietly to a tent town on the texan border
The number of internal migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively equal, among other things, as intensified rhetorics and measures of the Trump government have made it more difficult to house children with maintainers.
Traditionally, most maintainers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become even the target for an exposition when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential maintainers and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official of the customs authorities, explained before the convention that the authority arrested the devastating people who had been in charge of the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons had no previous entries in the penalty register.
“Around 80 percent of those who are either maintainers or members of a household of a maintainer are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people," explained Albumce.
In order to be able to process the cases of children faster, the officials introduced new rules, which, according to the staff of the accommodation, require for some children to appear in court within one month instead of 60 days after the arrest, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video switching and not personally to take action before an immigration judge for their legal status.
If negative decisions are taken, the person will be quickly disposed of.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to the information of the accommodation staff and reports known in the last month from the system that they are frightened and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced in a larger institution such as Tornillo, as signs that a child has problems are readily overlooked due to the size.
They also explained that it could strengthen Traumata, where many of the children are already suffering, if they were brought into a tent city without emotional preparation or enough time to adopt with friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called upon the Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces are illegally being treated on Syrian ground with the pretext of the fight against terrorism.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the assembly.
Moualem stated that the “war against terror was almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of other people have been expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned" by both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has stationed about 2000 soldiers in Syria, which mainly train and advise Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 soil troops in the war-run land.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return have been laid down and he accused 'some Western countries' of "distributed anger" to the refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to allow the return of their homes," he said.
'They politify a purely humanitarian matter.'
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid was granted to Syria as long as there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats explained that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel highburg of Idlib represents the possibility of pre-motivating political conversations.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem emphasized that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed its hope that military action against jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front, which is "to be destroyed" with Al-Qaeda, would be carried out.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to summon the first meeting of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and ease the way to elections.
Moualem mentioned the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the committee and explained that its work should be limited to the 'revision of the articles of the current Constitution' and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win its re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope, prematurely end an official withdrawal or a scandal of its presidency.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic final of a presidency ever.
So far, there are no signs that the spectators would have been satisfied.
Since 2014, the switching rates at the best transmission time at CNN have doubled to 1.05 million more than doubled and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBCs "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the switching rates to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is like a fire that attracts people magical because it is something that we don't understand," says Neal Bear, showrunner of the ABC drama series "designed survivor" on the TV broadcaster, via a cabinet member who will become the president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an ancient comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘because he brings me to laugh’’” said Scovell to me.
The chaos is worth entertainment.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike all the things that can be found on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortion Roe v Wade, the possible association of families and the health of the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, it is also possible to be an informed citizen if one becomes aware of having been watching six hours of an expert round that discusses a "coat of clothing" from Bob Woodward's so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive bomber jacket from street leather (laut Washington Post) or the effects of Stormy Daniel's giant description of Trumps, uh, anatomy.
For my part, I'll never be able to see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
"Some of what he does can be felt like a reality show that he presupposes to you every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief business leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "The Three of the Pound House", about Trump's rotating occupation and daily activity (a dispute with the Football Liga NFL breaking from the fence, calling Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a consequence, otherwise you don't come with it anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was 27 degrees sunny before his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crowned himself inside and looked at MSNBC while he recorded CNN at the same time.
He couldn't solve himself from the screen, not if Judge Kandidate Brett Kavanaugh was in a short position to express before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we made all these crazy missions at the time and the people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization’," said Fleiss to me.
"I thought that was a kind of joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Donations flooded the tightest races around seats in the Congress at the interim elections
It is little surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donations, thanks to the new borders of the electoral districts that led to two officials in the race around the same seat.
The newly drawn suburbs district in Pittsburg is the leader of the democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb is opposed to another official owner, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-signed after the Supreme Court of Justice of the State of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were violated and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a strike exchange of election financing between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a renowned special election in March around the 18th district of the state.
This seat was held by a Republican over a decade and Trump won a 20-percentage advance there.
Polit experts give the democrats a light lead.
The USA examined El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then went back
Graduates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized, without having hit great resistance from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners thrown out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the U.S. Foreign Ministry have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign offices from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to 'the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan', said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, El Salvador was only considering criminal measures, which were estimated to receive 140 million dollars of American aid services in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalty measures, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful to the central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, northern and central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar meeting in the previous year and represent a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the US.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively terminated the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now a spokesman at the conference held in mid-October to set a sign of the importance of the government of the congregation according to diplomatic statements.
The three American diplomatic representatives are silent and quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new screwed messages or penalties from Washington.
A government speaker from John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to comment on the internal meetings under the terms of anonymousness.
Their opinions were reaffirmed by one of the government's close external analysts, who also spoke under the terms of anonymousness.
Learning From History
The next great surprise could be the report by the specialist Robert Mueller on Trump's possible disability of justice, for which there are now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is now allegedly also investigating whether Trump's electoral team has conspirated with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the convention majority change, Trump is confronted with an organ that forces him to account exactly at the time when he passes by to stand again before the voters; and perhaps before a jury of jury.
These are many ‘If’ and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trump is inevitable, or that of its European borrowers.
On both sides of the Atlantic we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a state strike against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and had supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and a way to avoid the years of barbari that followed was missed.
The course of history is about such turning points and the incessant march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump leaves deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides about the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein was in Devil's kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he preceded to record the president secretly and speculated whether he was inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein declares the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we answer if the newly arranged FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or it is confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false statement in office?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a convention that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these trials, a long winter is ahead.
But I think we will not fail because of what I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Chechoslowakian Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my home of embassy.
She survived, migrated to America and sent me 60 years later to fire Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.
How can I not be optimistic with this heritage?"

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic in front of the game against Vienna
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive Remis against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put it into a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knees injury Graham Dorrans could not appear until the 2-2 equivalent to Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for larger ones.
"This was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good," says the 31-year-old.
We have gone into the game with the conviction that we can do something from it and we have traveled home with a point.
Maybe we could still have won at the end, but in total, a decision was probably a fair result.
You probably dominated in the first half, but we tried in the second half and were then the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a heavy party because they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can go through this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with all, what happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of sense of well-being.
The team is good and the boys are really good on it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Anxiety for aging leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants of the survey knew exactly how to care for them, few talked about it with their family members.
Approximately half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported to talk to your spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent reported talking about it with their children.
"The people want a family member to take care of her, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of National Insurance Protection.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you would like to be maintained, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: your consultant can also help you find an opportunity to finance these expenditures.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Compensate disputes in the last minute.
If you set up a precautionary authority, so that you order a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals meet your wishes, you should be unable to express it yourself.
Also consider a power of power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your invoices are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer any questions about taking medication or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan, so that you are ready.
"Not only the financial issues play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the drug treatment?"
Who cares about the dog?
Have you already finished this plan."

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami, who met on Friday on the Indonesian city of Palu, the authorities said. The number of dead should still rise.
Because of the outbreaks of communication systems, aid forces were unable to obtain information from the Donggala District of Government, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi, located over a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles).
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, an estimated 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue of the economy Central-Sulawesis, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel lab construction is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
In the last 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis, according to Indonesian civil protection authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West-Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996, with nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific fire ring, and is frequented by earthquakes.
Here some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatras triggered a tsunami on December 26, which met 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of which in Aceh.
2005: A number of severe earthquakes shocked the western coast of Sumatras between the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands on the coast of Sumatras.
2006: An earthquake with the strength of 6.8 shaken the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700.
2009: An earthquake with the strength 7.6 met the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength 7.5 shaken one of the Mentawai islands before Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters height that destroyed damaging villages and demanded about 300 people's lives.
2016: A light earthquake shocked the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people died by crashing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes met the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular to tourists, especially on the north side of the island, and demanded more than 500 deaths.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stretched on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and former candidates for the office of the Vice President, was arrested because of accusations of body injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of the suspicion of domestic violence, the disability of the report of domestic violence and the resistance to state authority, such a report published by the police of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took off the phone to a friend when he wanted to get the police.
Palin is located in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility, according to KTUU, and a deposit of $500 has been collected.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he was asked for his plea with 'not guilty, very sure', the network said.
Palin is accused of having committed three irregularities of class A, which can be charged with up to a year of imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with an unlawful class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin's penalties were raised.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disability of reporting a crime and the possession of weapons under defence influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend threw him to beat her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she reduced her son’s behavior to a posttraumatic stress disorder following his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that the Indonesian island of Sulawesi shocked on Friday.
The quake with a thickness of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been interrupted and it is assumed that the number of dead will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred shortly before the coast of Central Sulewesis, which is located north-east of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos circulate on the social networks from the time the wave met on the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami met on the coast.
Federal Attorney calls for rare death penalty for suspects in New York terrorist attack
The Federal Attorney in New York demands the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the terrorist attack of New York City, who cost eight human lives. This is a rare penalty that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up of the construction market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, in the course of which he ran on a bicycle route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, while passing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the accusers must prove that Saipov killed the eight oven "determined" and "consciously" add serious body infringements, according to the intent of claiming the death penalty filed in the Southern New York District.
Both charges could be punished by death in accordance with the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigation warrant Saipov submitted a letter of charge in 22 points covering eight charges of the murder against the background of the organised crime, which are normally used by state lawyers in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'basic planning and purpose', according to the prosecutors, which described the kind in which Saipov did, as 'horrible, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and loss," says the statement.
Five were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the Southern district of New York has no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to a lifelong sentence of freedom in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York during a federal defence was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been spoken to the conspiracy of spionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, witnessed in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, according to court documents.
He told before investigators to feel good with what he did, the police said.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to act after looking at videos from ISIS on his phone, the prosecution letter.
He also requested, according to police, to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public prosecutors representing Saipov, stated that she was "naturally disappointed" because of the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty will only extend the dream that all involved will suffer, instead of a debt consent in exchange for a lifelong sentence of freedom without the possibility of being released," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the charge not to demand the death penalty.
A Member of the Conservative Party asks NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage sworn to mobilise the power of the people today during a protest action within the context of the Tories Conference.
The former Ukip Party Chief said that politicians must “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, while a Member of Theresa May's Party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative retirement agent Peter Bone explained to the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be “ready outside” if Farage Brexit Minister.
The challenge facing May in reconciliation of its deeply disfellowshipped parties has been intensified by the participation of members of your party who are for a stay in the EU in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping Chequer's compromise plan on the agenda despite the attacks of the Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies argued that despite the counter-reactions, it should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Eurosceptics and the oppositional Labour Party to decide between their package and the 'Chaos'.
Bone explained at the 'Leave Means Leave' demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belonged to the garbage’.
He proposed that farage should have been appointed to a peer and that he should have delegated the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was responsible for this, we would already be outside,' he said.
Wellingborough's MEP added: ‘I’m going to stand for the Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: ‘ We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.’
Bone rejected claims that since the 2016 referendum, the public opinion has changed: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit supporter of Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and explained reporters: ‘I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and in our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure that we are chosen.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a strong message to May, she continued: ‘Premium Ministers keep their jobs when you keep their promises.’
Farage explained in a speech that politicians must feel ‘the pressure’, they should be cheating on the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is a question of confidence between us, the people, and our political class,’ says Farage.
“They are trying to deceive the Brexit and that is why we are here today to say to them: ‘That doesn’t get away from you.’
Before an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is just about betraying the Brexit, feel the pressure.
‘We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which helped us to victory in the referendum and will never rest as long as we are not independent, self-administrative, proud United Kingdom.’
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour exploration in the city centre.
A few activists blew banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on weekends.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
‘That’s the people who tell us that they can ensure that IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ says Adonis.
'That's a farce.
There is simply not the good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine precisely’ presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the elections in November, she would “examine precisely the presidential candidate.”
The Boston Globe reports that the democrat of Massachusetts was talking about their future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a pronounced critic of President Donald Trump, is in the race for the re-election for the Senate against the Republican MEPs in the House of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was Vice Chairman of Trump's election team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the center of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been her 36th meeting with electors in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's office.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to join the Presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women “to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which includes women at the top.”
Detention by death fees on LSU player Sims
The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday in the case of fatal shots on LSU Basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. in the morning Eastern Time.
They had published a shooting video on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen at the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shot injury and died as a result of this injury," said the 247 Sports Media Portal of the Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the place of action and possession of a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any further incidents and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre-sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 start-ups during the last season and could average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great price from Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world champion title after his team has left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Stallorder from Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the Pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost as if he was performing Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel went into the box first and made Hamilton move into the traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton took it over after a short bike-on-rad-Manöver, where the Ferrari-pilot reluctantly released the inner side to endure the risk after two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen began on one of the back seats of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round on place seven.
He was then mostly the fastest of the race, since he held at his tyre to close quickly and pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally went in the 44th round into the box and did not manage to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished as fourth.
It was a difficult day since Valtteri brought an excellent performance throughout the weekend and like a real gentleman acted when he had to leave me by.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump was funny on Saturday at a election event on Senator Dianne Feinstein, who persisted in not having passed on to the press to the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement in front of the Senate Justice Committee was not directly addressed, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are "common, evil and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the miraculous thing that has happened in the last few days in the senate is when one sees the anger when people who are angry and mean and evil and dishonest," says the President.
“ When you look at the leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Remember your answer... Published the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't published it."
Okay, please wait.
Did we... no, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was given the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and was published at the beginning of September. However, Feinstein disputes that the leak originates from her office.
"I have not hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, I have not published your history," said Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret, and I answered her request for confidentiality."
Your dementi did not seem to come well to the president who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his ongoing defense of the Judge Candidate, whom three women accused sexual offences, claimed that the democrats would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to conquer power with all means.
One sees the community, the wickedness, they do not care about who they injured, when they get under the wheels to get power and control," said Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer achieved two gates for the giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat back on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 victory in Dundee's replay on Saturday.
The giants went to the lead early with two gates, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made the compensation for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of the giants.
Francois Bouchard liked to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two gates.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for the men of Adam Keefe, the Dundee struck 2-1 on Friday evening in Belfast.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the giant won the three previous parties.

Flight slots died after he was sure that hundreds of people escaped the earthquake in an airplane
A flight slot in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to have a plane with hundreds of people on board safely.
More than 800 people died and many are missed after the island of Sulawesi was shocked by a devastating earthquake that caused a tsunami on Friday.
Strong descendants are still felt in the region and many people are caught under debris in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan refused to leave his posts in the strongly fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed in order to make sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the starting track at the time, could safely take off.
He jumped out of the Tower when he thought he crashed.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of dead could rise to several thousand. The country's civil protection authority explained that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to rise as many bodies are still under the debris, while others cannot be reached", says the speaker of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Authority.
Waves with up to 6 meters height have ruined Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse."
Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and explained in a speech before the military of the country: “I ask you to work all day and night to carry out all the tasks that go along with evacuation.
Since you've been ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was already shocked this year by earthquakes in Lombok, with over 550 people dying.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini is now reporting of a missing after aeroplane crash in Lagune
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports of a missing person after claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini explained in a message that until Saturday afternoon they can't say anything about the stay of a passenger.
The Airline indicated to cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The Airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
Local boats helped to save the other passengers and crew members after the plane had crashed into the water when attempting to land on the Chuk Island Airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be brought to a hospital.
The airline indicated that on Saturday six passengers were still in the hospital but were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact expiry of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the landing train.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane flew beyond the landing track.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was very flat.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others could wake through deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight companions were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors working near the improvement of an installation site rushed with an inflatable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane was sinking in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
The data of the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 people have died in crashes from airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the passing of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded its evidence in the renegotiation of a case where a man is accused of exiling a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the American Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett said for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said that he received position data from different phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers on the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the period in which he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police talked to Sanford.
Sanford came to witness on Saturday and said that he hadn't been in the city on the day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had said the truth when he claimed to be in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
But phone recordings pointed out that they knew for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis lost his cell phone some time after Chamber's death of their news, calls and contact information.
"He removed them from his life," said Hale.
The defense is expected to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the procedure will then go before the jury this day.

Another black one?!
New Yorker Child Girl sues couples for dismissing 'rascist' SMS
A New York child girl complains a couple because of a discriminatory release after she received a misleading message from the mother, in which he complained that she was "noch a black".
The couple argued to be racist and compared the dispute with a 'pression'.
The two-fold mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her surprise when she found out that the new mother of the day, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEIN, NOCH A SWARZE," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice.
After she recognized her Fauxpas, the "smart touched" Plasco-Flaxman Maurice escaped and claimed that the opened African mother had done bad work and instead expected her to have a Philippine, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a furnace.
Now Maurice accuses the couple of compensation for the release and claims compensation for the $350 a day, which she should have been booked for over six months, for which she had originally, but without contract, and for which she had lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do this," she said to the newspaper on Friday, "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the racism accusations and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after they had insulted them, could no longer trust.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the Post.
“But would you trust your children to a person who was unrepentant to them, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.
Plasco compared the dispute with a 'pression' and explained that his wife expects a baby in only two months and is 'in a difficult situation'.
“You want such a person to be interested?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the dispute continued, the couple were quickly condemned in the public and opposed to the social media, where they were criticized for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speaking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said about the letter: “It is hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's enormous success today."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, would have been rejected his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death last year was "bittersweet".
She explained that your father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she describes as "very important family member".
"He was a very silent man and was not praising," said Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if you had a child that has something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success in this way.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself the responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to adopt her via the phone
After the country, her daughter was brought to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad regularly called to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chances," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to adopt from her.
And I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep their heart on the pump sounded slowly and left their body.
She had just died, and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was mourning about the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers who didn't get anything from what she was through, on board the plane.
"Nobody knew it," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sorrowing women hang on cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost family members by suicide strive to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales cards with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting places.
Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and had an infectious smile.
“Everybody knew him for his smile.
All said that his smile could brighten a room."
However, he terminated his job before his death, since he was “in a truly dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found by his then 11-year-old brother after the suicide.
Davis said: "I always fear that this could have an effect."
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people to whom you can go and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't remain silent: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years together, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he was depressed or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was at the low point. When the children unpacked their gifts, he didn't see them in their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great dream for her, but that it had to say: “It breaks a huge hole into the family.
It breaks us.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the swim while the FBI begins with investigations
"I thought that if we could actually get something that he asked, i.e. a timely and limited investigation, we might have a little contradiction," said Flake on Saturday.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Their opposition can be traced to the timing alone.
The interim elections on 6 November are only five weeks away. If the Republicans were to cut down badly as expected, they would be significantly weak in their attempts to choose their husband to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush took the phonephone to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents his report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide with equal votes, and to confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflowers ‘sinct’ under Kim
The number of North Korean overflowers to South Korea has fallen to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who calls for data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, explained that last year 1127 overflowers were registered compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as main factors.
Pjöngjang did not express himself publicly.
The majority of overflowers from the north are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul suggests that since the end of the Korea War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the overflowers more illegal than refugees and often leads them back with violence.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State met in Pjöngjang for discussions about the deuklearisation negotiations set up.
As a result of the historical meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, they agreed to work on a deuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without trusting in the US, we have no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to waive ourselves first unilaterally," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says that he is not suitable for the Office at the Supreme Court of Justice
The minority leader in the Nancy Pelosi Representatives' House called Judge candidates Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was characteristic of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who had acted so would have been called ‘hysterical’”, said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
In an emotional way, Kavanaugh pointed out all accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost shouted and stood shortly in tears when he spoke of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him a “great and coordinated call murder” organized by Liberals, who were angry about Hillary Clinton’s lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that they believe that Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as she demonstrates that he was predominant to democrats.
"I believe that he has declared himself inappropriate with these statements and the way with which he moved over the Clintons and the Democrats," she explained.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to withdraw Kavanaugh from the Office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not say the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also inappropriate for his current judicial post," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Bundesberufungsgericht in Washington D.C.
Pelosi continued to say that as a democrat, she is concerned about possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision, Roe v Wade, as he is estimated as a conservative judge.
In his hearings Kavanaugh asked whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We don't need a hysterical, preset person who goes to this Court of Justice and expects us to say, 'Ach is not wonderful'," says Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere hatred speech, months and years of overcooking anger and it does not get out without crying.
"We cry when we become angry," said Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped by a woman who was somewhere manager and said that she also weep when she becomes angry but has developed a technique. If she becomes angry and begins to cry, she tells the person she said: “You may think that she is sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just continues to speak.
I found that ingenious."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories is a former job, in an office dominated by men, where I cried one day because of an indescribable anger and was drawn into a staircase by an older woman, an undercooled manager, before whom I was always a little afraid.
"Let them never see you cry," she told me.
"You don't know you're stinky.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with yourself, as they believe you have gone in the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congress member of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship named Monkey Business at an extramarital affair and then withdrawn his candidateship, the most frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason to consider not the idea of the Presidential candidate himself.
"That wasn't a well-thinking decision," she told me 30 years later with a laughter.
They were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation: ‘sneezing and the seven dwarfs’.’
Since the election struggle had already been progressed, it was back in the middle purchase and she swore not to compete if it should not get $2 million together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters who donated men $1,000 supported their campaign only with $250.
"Do they believe that I get a discount?" she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so difficult about her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that made the acquisition of funds and direct addressing the voters instead of the delegates, and the anger about sexism so overwhelmed that she was near to tears.
"You could have assumed that I suffered a nervous collapse," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my gravestone.
"She cried"?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the USA and China
The opening salves of the trade war between the USA and China were deceptive. Although the battle is not over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a long-term grave between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, the American president, fired the first warning fire at the beginning of the year when he occupied important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum, with penal duties.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new penal duties on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
Beijing relapsed in the same way each time and recently raised penalties from five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China swore to answer any measure in the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon kill.
Moving Washington to arrange would mean to give up. However, a public collapse against the US would be much too tasty for China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“In fact, the fact that a rapid political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized," says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee who focuses on Asia in the Denkfabrik Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in the reconstruction of the land ruined by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the circumstances in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to reverse normality.
All the conditions are now laid down for the voluntarily return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their everyday lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomes help in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept any aid provided by conditions of countries who had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated Team USA with a final stand of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost on European soil six consecutive times and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the US.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with a large part of the tournament, lowered his turn on the 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all its rounds and became one of the four players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was hit 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team of Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who possibly played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player ever with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win back the poka.
It is about the team and I am glad to have contributed," says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues to pass the torch on to his countryman John Rahm, who won the American golf-leighing tiger woods on Sunday 2:1 in the single encounters.
I am so incredible proud to have hit Tiger Woods, which I have been following in television since my childhood," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the largest players ever who won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems to find the fairways throughout the weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who made high-quality services throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance of his team, American captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything from it.
Take a hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players made a good performance.
We'll regroup, I'll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be her captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
