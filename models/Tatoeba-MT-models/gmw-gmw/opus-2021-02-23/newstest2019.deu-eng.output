DFB Chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB-President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that one comes into the conversation that one also talks with him about why he apparently felt this as it was laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmaher" of the "Image-Zeitung.
Despite the debate about the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I have also assumed that this would be the case for a certain time," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also founded it that Grindel had not defended him against racist opposition during the World Cup.
The DFB Chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from the football so that if "you leave a team or change a club that you talk about it with your coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not been done so far."
Linz: Garden cottage in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 14.13 a.m., the occupational firefire Linz was alarmed to a fire at Angerhofweg.
Because a high voltage line leads directly through the screaming species settlement, danger was in the absence.
The professional firefire drove out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically for the whole and fireshutt to be cleared to an essential extent.
According to the owners of the burning garden hut, he had set up an battery for loading at noon.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, the charging device was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined, as well as the cause of fire.
However, he should be significant, for the owner had many collectors in his garden cottage.
Wounding mother resents: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What has Lindsay Lohan just driven to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to break out the children from a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") himself streamed live as she apparently wanted to break the children from a family in Moscow.
This reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial average of the stream.
Here you can see "To luck kisses" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip there is to see Lohan rising out of a car and going to a perhaps homeless family that she wants to become a refugee family from Syria.
When the family escapes from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It claims the adults to trade in children.
For all this, she does not provide evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this right now," Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to track the family along the road.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses an ear fig.
Under tears, the actress then regrets how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently completely unclear.

At the beginning, there was a Tweet.
At the beginning of August, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk made an announcement of the withdrawal of the Eletroautobauer.
U.S. stock market supervision accused him of fraud, but now both have agreed.

Party Day of the British Conservatives
Sharp guarded - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a force struggle.
On the party day, it is about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit-Hardlines, at the front of Boris Johnson.
Reference for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been struggling about these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called northern Macedonia in the future, and this Sunday the population agrees - whether it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against legal populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood is divided in the country.
Thousands went to the street in several cities to protest against the legal populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trip of Brazil" gives itself as an anti-system candidate and thus lies ahead of the surveys.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the left working party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" work takes longer than planned
"The diesel taskforce is still available," said development director Peter Mertens to the industry magazine "Automobilwoche".
The detained and imprisoned Audi Chief Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force will be dissolved soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all motor/driven combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said now: "In the beginning of July, we have reached an important stage goal in the preparation of this circulation.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel candal at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "great organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurred again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities shall propose to the Audi Chief to have authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after notification of exhaust frauds.
He knew of the manipulations or consciously ignored them.
Currently, the Head of Sales Board Bram Schot is head of the company as the Head of Commissaris.
Due to the conversion to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there are production losses at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronn voice".
Basically, he sees a sinking demand for Limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment in itself is difficult," he said.
Schot's on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations are already available.
Grindel aims to re-election - Lahm is supposed to go to the DFB presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to return to the office as DFB President, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup out and Özil's office in the following year.
"I make my work and try to make it as good as it is," said Grindel as a guest on the early Sunday morning at the "Current Sports Studio" of the ZDF.
You always have to try to re-election, I'll do that.
And then you'll have to watch if the support is there.
The head of the Association finds it "remarkable" in his own words if he would not have "should be involved in the future project" after the grant for the 2024 football project.
Grindel has been the successor of the Wolfgang Niersbach, who has been thrown over the summer fairs since April 2016.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first complete term of office of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
The future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to cooperate according to Grindel at the DFB presidium.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues at the Bureau agreed that he will also be advised in this role in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, welcome to provide his experience with sporting questions," Grindel said.
In speculations whether lame could become his successor as DFB chief, he didn't want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair regarding the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that a national player should be a DFB’s embassy without a migration background.
This office currently operates the born Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, which has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is one without a migration background that works clearly into society and soccer and says, "the topic is important, then we have to take care of," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on site where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Correct decreasing with half-wise scales
I have a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight but also the body fat content.
It can also display muscle and bone mass.
The body-mass index also calculates the thing, but it's rather for the sausage.
He doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat by muscles.

Erdoğan opens Moschee in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Moschee in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Kanzler Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day visit.
Criticism to Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan urged the German government to deliver live trailers to the Gulf Movement in Germany and proceed against Kurdish Separatists.
We'll protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shaken our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib-Moschee, the city centre of Cologne had been partially locked.
Several thousand policemen were employed - among them also shaft protectors.
The Islamic Association Ditib is criticized because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufs and Terrorism
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in the New York Central Park.
"Engages you wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival at the night to Sunday around 60,0000 viewers.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Also actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations were shown on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a horror sec, when many spectators held the sound of a falling metal locking for shots, became scared and tried to flee.
Shortly, panic emerged, people ran through each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people from the stage.
"Nobody's trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all in security.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as each year.
Anyone who wanted to be a father had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were jubilees and applause for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This one, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake expressed himself as judge at the Supreme Court in the U.S. Senate's judicial committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, and thus pushed many women to the head.
At least three women have raised accusations of abuse to attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which they reject.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations, after two women, who have experienced their own sexual offences, faced him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also like to meet with me at any time in a elevator," said Flake at the concert in New York.
Press Freedom: Federal Government defends rumour from the journalist
Registrar Steffen Seibert has defended the rumor of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had moved a T-shirt with the Turkish and German note "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, wasn't the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption in the process of the press conference.
As a result of the journalist's action, there was a strong disruption, which was not acceptable.
He caused people's guards to bring out the man.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellor Office.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged spy activities or of support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah wave movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed punch attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatening several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also uncertain from the Turkish authorities: First in early September, Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Lastly, the cases of the detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel provided for attention.
Although they came free and were able to return to Germany, they still run processes against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
As fresh and well-looking, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for moisturized conversations at the theke of the Hamburg harbour kneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller, with her guests, attacks some beer, some wine or even more high percentage drinks to lock up the mood and tongues.
Many promises also drink courage for the mandatory vocals.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Menhearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Illegal Day".
The Münchner did not get a good trip to the high north.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely scared on it, the eyes only two small slides.
The bed-selfie shows a totally lulled florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
To his fans he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Line one: never goes to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And spray.
And the round of Eierlikor, the Ina smells around half three, also leaves away.
Alcohol consumption is indeed written to the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips on combating the wounds.
They ranged from instant broths, fish breads or - probably most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the usual attractive cinema.
As Ina Müller survived the nightly surgery, so far is not known.
However, since she has moderated the TV fun at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be more probable...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and unhappiness
The entry into the 36-kilometre road in the Red Coopland in Treysa presents itself hard to find and disguise.
Recipes against aggressive vandalism are searched, but solutions are hardly distinct.
Screws, cigarette chickens, waste and unhappiness, demolished trash and now dismantled signs - so long ago the entrance with a group of seats to the bike path on the Haaße Hill in Treysa has been present.
For the shower object Railway in the Red Coop Land a more than unbelievable sight.
However, the theme has been addressed by members of the local group of the ADFC Schwalmstadt for a longer time, according to the cycling officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling board.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from relocation of the seating group to regular disposal of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the starting point.
"I think that the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been introduced to the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting point on weekends.
It's not only a lot of noise, but the layers are also destroyed: pouring from the earth, wastebasket demolished, skulls knocked down, seating furniture demolished.
Volunteers had already cleared up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drops on the hot stone.
They're angry that the Rastplatz on the bike path in Treysa is Treysa Treffpunkt for surgery.
"With the entire bike path there is clearly the focus on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling officer, who is now also concerned with the new cycling site in goatshain which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it becomes really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance at the hill: "This may significantly increase the threshold of grasping common goods.
This would, however, require a police strip to be over time.
In principle, deserthagen wishes to develop the Haaße-Hügel.
It needs to be more attractive.
With the frequency of the bike path you could be very satisfied so far.
Tourist marketing is still capable of expanding.
Our bike path is very high in comparison to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger site, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Asheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no breach on the Haase hill.
In the case of regular traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but well for older people and especially for children.
Music-Contest at the Cultural Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the Lake
The first call to the music competition was a success, creative and in common.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the town's part-offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music competition for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A competition "with eye weakening in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family companion with coffee and cakes from the honourable officials of the cultural station.
Seven formations occurred, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Himig, a long albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltrup star colors", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the children's garden Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the blackies.
This competition, according to the district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city yet.
What were the texts associated with?
At the places the Hiltruper lake and the market hall were particularly common mention.
Rolf Himig circulated the Allee in his beat-like song to the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also recognized.
It was repeatedly about the experience of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the artists or hints about her creation.
So Humberg was told that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
From the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew to report that he was youngest in Ludwigshafen - at a big event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all the way on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was still something special for the jury's favorites - so that others can also hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann.
Further musicians can record a song: Himig with his Hiltrup camp, who especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland Rudle": "a very beautiful appearance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children came up to the final again - and even sounded "right well" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, initiation of the melody and recognising value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the District Office.
The district office had launched the event on the occasion of their ten-year-old existence.
She appreciated the event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural train station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that are opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords that can be decrypted - the old trick with the red foil - only when you put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything from mistake.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3rd dice.
4. Fast".
These are the terms it has to be used to encrypt.
Because it is not to guess the terms here, but codes.
Alternatively, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" it is not to be advised the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "worms", "feast" and "windows" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible, because that wins the party if it manages to knock the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads loudly: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to the festival; here, of course, something like "Party" would also be possible and "Prag" because he has watched out in school and knows the window turz there.
That's how it's going for round, team for team.
You do not know the words of the opposite - but with any hint given by the encryptor there, they can better unite.
Possibly mysterious, but not to turn off, the descriptions should be so, otherwise one makes it unnecessarily difficult to his team.
The most cryptic to "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players are likely to have to study it quite long and thoroughly until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever has first laid off will be fascinated how much feeling is in this seeming game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as clever as predecessors and genre primus "codenames", which is also a agent theme to a game that is less words, but for which it is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever's only about guessing and not about victory points, it can also easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harassed guests in the Kneipe
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday twice.
First he showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper Town of a passing police strip, later he also fell in the Upper Town in a puppet when he harassed other guests.
After clearly alcoholized, he had to spend the night at the police inspection of Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, it must then also rely on criminal responsibility for the use of statutory marks of unlawful organisations.
Company Pressig was home to the Schubs
For decades, the railway company in Pressig was the rotary disc in the Frankenwald.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffer knocked on buffer, it was heard in all pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the train station.
It didn't raise anybody.
Then the brakes also quietly knatched and the cars knatched.
It was just a clean railroad.
Statements that are symbolically for Dinkels Heimat Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place thus characterized by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep burst line to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 elevators, has its hiking point in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, trains and shocks were needed earlier, who had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway plant with 21 locows, apprenticeship, driving and train championship.
"The heartpiece was the rotary disc, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional trainers.
The Bamberg station (BW) Pressig, which was accommodated in 1968, also operated locomotives for the side sections Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - northern half.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimised the need for train and shock blocks.
From 1977 onwards, they were only used in freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 weights were placed in the month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were canceled, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that one has not taken into account a better use of the site, including in the case of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nürnberg Railway Directorate for the Anniversary "50 Years of Elektrization Nürnberg - Saalfeld" celebrated a pumping station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later the out.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were deducted, the Pressig Rangerbahnhof was history.
"The ranks and brass shoe arms completed the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Every failure had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rotenkirchen station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are available here in the InfranchPlus article.
Kerber with success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon victor Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber victoryed the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the third world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakh, or the Spanierin Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund führte 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian set up at number 13.
The swab now gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
In the context of the series "Kunst und Genuss" a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open ground of the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Rund ums Walberla" under the series "Kunst und Genuss".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large visitor's appeal showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Just as Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as a main organizer and artist.
Somewhat surprising but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his job in proven, young hands with a good prospect for the future.
Both of them have already actively participated in the selection of the artists and contributed to Flyer.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is another 70 cent special letter brand designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "dances out", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high appeal of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler could be won from Nuremberg for the musical framement.
At the way through the generous garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playful expression.
The artworks are made of metal or ceramic, often with colourful accents.
At the entrance of the property, the visitor expects on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, colourfully brightened, playful with 20 wind wheels, 24 hufters and 24 alu tubes as a soundpiece.
With the sun bleaching through the bush in the background, the object works fairly sunny and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, which is preferred in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
Halfway, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heaven Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imaginations of tone, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for the grinding through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festival
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albachtens at that time also made their mischief air.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find partout that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more sinful life in the district.
In the meantime, it has become a legend: at a bank in the tinbush they lifted the MGV 68 albachts from baptism.
It was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It's going to be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
They had re-established the foundation festival for the anniversary.
It was tradition for years, then there was a break.
The festival of tradition was back to the 50th anniversary.
An elegant ball was asked before for festive clothing.

Volleyball: 3. Liga Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The riser marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under screen domination of Axel Büring is quite well prepared in Liga three.
No trace of shyness or frack sausages, the independents make their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city concurrent BW Aasee quite good.
"That wasn't glass clear, but we have already left impression," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker joined this immediately: "This is a defeat that we can live with.
We are not dissatisfied".
In the evening at a later birthday celebration of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence the guests had a sentence ball.
"When they bring it into the goal, such a game can chicken," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its rustinized forces and brought the full exploitation into the goal.
"We all know who is in such a Derby on the other side.
This doesn't break us the neck.
I have seen quite good volleyball phases," Annacker did not have the 0:3 - and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the Independent, after just three games seems not to be available.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional liga volleyball." In the fourth league they no longer want to look down.
If the West is not polluted in the next weeks, they must look upstairs.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven parties.
On Saturday it will go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dreamship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about that the series could have had a co-debt to her marriage out with Hans von Borsody.
Their role of Ledebur's Chiefhostess Beatrice on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018, she went off board forever.
The series that made her become a star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she had been married for ten years.
"This could have been a reason too.
Because I was grown up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues observed me at eyes' height," Keller says in conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
First, she had always been "the woman of Hans von Borsody", but this had changed with the "dreaming ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so well, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her husband at that time could have been quite envy, but "How many men also shook Hans's conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody "the only right one and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed," as she continues to explain.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, who I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared freaky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "because I was afraid that it could also fail a second time."
On the day before the government wedding, I was crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage of Borsody also failed.
Why did the men never work?
Because I wanted too much.
The love of cellars at that time was "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I got too naïve to love."
The night-falter, which regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ-Ressort Zurich, waged this time to the ZFF opening party.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the cruel shine, in which a green carpet is immersed on the six-eye square, blends it over a fee.
But it's still film festival, there's more or less famous people want to sun in the light of the light.
So on this late Thursday evening, he twists over the place to facilitate himself in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase" shortly.
This is the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the need facility in the parterre of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to flow a luxurious ambience.
But this evening it stinks in the Lord's Oasis for any reason to heaven.
So out here, across the other street side: Coming guests who have been entertaining the film "Green Book" in the cinema next to the opening film just at the best level are celebrating the beginning of the festival each year with a party in the three-storey warehouse.
Their name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown are known to come from the entire earthball.
What do you think about an article about this festival is not all necessary in order not to fall into slack advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The falter binds a bundle around the feelings that have put him a good feather, and two bully doorsteers actually win him in generously.
Inside the invites, they dance far after midnight to live music or can be suggested by DJ rhythms to which they scream each other, and rinse down with Cupli exquisite chicks.
In the delicatessenladen in the souterrain, oysters are waiting for squeezing mounds, next to the incomparable turtle Culatello di Zibello is cut up freshly, a chocolate fountain is spruded.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You must love this country for it!
The Falter studys the sign at the roller staircase: "Trage a long dress, please be careful on the roller staircase."
If the two separate instructions were, he put himself in the Dress Code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved life already.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry kicks a cocktail prepared with Espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not complicate the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been throwing this brand for years, isn't here in the evening either.
But there, between local prominence, cassentic and kitchen items, a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
His main actor should not be far.
And really: Equally, Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost like a chornob acting, walks through the crowd.
He's not arrogant, not arrogant, he's been stolen at most.
Just for this retention, like misunderstood as constance, love international stars of this film festival.

Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to Last Minutes Pipe "Destroyed on the Soil"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball party liligist ASV, could hardly hold it: "So a bitter defeat." His shelters were "devastated on the ground" after the unhappy 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They hadn't played badly - like in Steinhagen, like against Hüllhorst - over a wide range of phases, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we have totally slept," the ASV trainer was angry.
The housemen quickly carried with 8:1, even the early expiry that Bieletzki had taken, did not produce fruit at first.
"Then, however, suddenly a back through the team," Bieletzki summarized the second quarter hour.
At the break, the residue was only more than two gates.
Especially Senden's Bester, Marius Hintze, met one another time in the phase.
After the change it became even better from visitor view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst liked at 15:15, then the seasonal changer almost carried out.
Four minutes before the sirene, the advance was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Take into action the impartials.
Bieletzki usually guards against seeking the debt with others.
But: The 120-second-time penalty, the Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke."
LIT had good laughing and met four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought greatly, also standing well at the back of seven men and throwing them back to the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now there's a damn victory," says the restless Bieletzki.
ASV tower: hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kumper (2), Mühlhoff (2), of the Pole (2).
Highing (1).

The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are watching in the network.

Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should prefer to use passphrase to secure their accounts in the network.
Additionally, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm to equip computers with an anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening withdrawal as head of the milliard heavy company.
He and the US Stock Exchange Supervisory SEC submitted an extrajudicial dispute on misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to lead stock noted companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay each $20 million, and Musk also issued for three years the office of the Chairman, a position comparable to the German Supervisory Board.

Musk is not aware of any debt
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed by the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th, Musk had written its more than 22 million Twitter trailers, he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay $420 per share that the financing was secured.
This would have been a total of $72 billion.
Later, Musk ran back: Tesla stays on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a chairman from outside, set up two independent board members and also set up a committee that monitors Musks communication.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel until 2021 as Chancellor
After the crossings of the past weeks, the GroKo collects several survey depths.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has overwhelmed the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday federally.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases a counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestagswahl on Sunday, the Government Partys SPD, CDU and CSU, according to Emnid, would only get 43 percent of the votes together.
This means that the great coalition has at present lost the majority of all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach, in the Sunday question.
The governmental parties are continuously reaching 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Alarmbach: 51 percent).
At the 2017 Bundestagswahl, they received 53.4 percent together.
In the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, in several surveys, is the second strongest party to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach voting shares from 12,5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, and FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the proportion of votes.
However, the restraint for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also significantly decreased since the Bundestagswahl 2017.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Office of Chancellor, as the Emnid Survey revealed on behalf of the BamS.
Only every second (50 percent) demands, according to the survey, that the large coalition holds up to the next regular federal election in three years, 41 percent are for a new election.

The Germans also evaluate splits whether Merkel should again be present for the CDU Chair in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are for it, 44 percent against it.
Accordingly, 64 percent of the Union's trailers do not want a candidateship, 35 percent.
Slope at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Is Aldi going to Tender 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tender there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk with Aldi about putting meat.
Munich - In times of the digital "Fastfood Dating" by Tender and Co., the supermarket is almost an anachronistic romantic as a place of knowledge for the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced Putenfleisch, boxershort cutting on the wolf table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The App Tender is in the reputation to be less a contact, but rather a sloppy stock exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react, you don't talk long around the hot breeze in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood-Lovestory-Potential has it when love happiness precedes an out-the-eye-lost-and-recovered plot.
If the type is also reported under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de in his worship, it sounds very much to Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this Annonce in an unknown Aldi branch that she will also find her dreamman, with whom she has spoken shortly about the "30 percent reduced bio-pute meat".
She deserved her Happy End à la Hollywood for the faith in the magic of analogue knowledge.

Football: District Liga: Researchers' performance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, Alois Fetsch went to the court with the His hard ones.
He, the coach of the Football Districtist VfL Wolbeck, retired (internal) to think about the lack of performance on the green.
All the story.
Meanwhile, it's running around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrian evidence is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past play time only scratched thin on the rise.
Yes, I'm very satisfied with the appearance.
"We have made the rooms tight and pressured the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and searched each individual for the party to simply say "Thank you" for so much opposition against the ambitious guests.
The Coach had to make a system switch after 26 minutes.
After Nico Frerich's injuries (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came to him - the 4-4-2 almost seamless went into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes waited for balls in front.
Wolbeck had significantly more play shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his out (17th), the alternate Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroeh (38th) missed the leadership.
This would almost have happened when, in Minute 41, the SCA appeared twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his expertise.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes of 18 meters failed shortly.
After 58 minutes of screw came too late at a Thewes input.
With the change of Miles Geske, fetch left again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect release to the seatmen 18 meters in front of the guest's housing.
The fouled came up himself and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhues" Thing with the right sleeve struck at the bottom left from the view of the shelter - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes to get fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the 80th minute in the penal room unhappy to the hand.
The arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske had the victor on the pus in the 87th minute of 12 meters.
Could have been too much good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroeder - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in business boards
As shown in the report "Die Macht der Monokultur", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday, only 8 percent of the boards were female at the 1st September.
"Companies will have to stand differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Stiftungs-Geschäftsführer Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely malely occupied leadership teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The residue makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented compared.
It's another corporate culture.
The minor increase in women's share among German stock exchange companies is also due to positive impulses in the enterprises of the medium-sized value index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in recent years - the women's share has been stagnated.
Recently 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again in the next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increase the share of "null percent".
Another picture comes from the supervisory boards: On 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"As many women were recruited annually for the boards, 40 percent would be achieved in 2023," says the report.
Some even make Miese: luxury cards: Which manufacturer deserves most per car?

Who makes the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car that they sell?
This question was addressed by "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made with every car sold 69,000 Euro operating profits in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, is only about 800 Euros, Tesla and Bentley.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi with average prices of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and approximately 3,000 euros profit before interest and tax EBIT are well in the race.

Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in the collision of an emergency car with a taxi.
The cab driver, the notary and their drivers were severely injured, as the police told.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had crossed a red traffic on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then joined a crossing with the taxi that was driving with green.
After the collision, the doctor's car swallowed against an ample and a tree.
He recorded the passant who died in the place of accident.
Passenger driver and taxi driver severely injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from employers.
The also severely injured 29-year-old emergency physician could free himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three severe injuries were brought to hospitals.
In close coordination with the Bonner State Prosecutor, the police determines who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we're inconvenient
After the blamable out in the Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
ManU 1:3 is subject to West Ham United. The way of defeat is still to speak.
Imaginatively, the scene was in the 74th minute when the rehealed Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly brought the Red Devils back to play.
As they suspected an offside at the Pass of Mark Nobel, all defense players of Manchester stood and read Arnautovic all the time around the world to shoot the ball by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative highlight of a previously inadequate performance over wide distances.
At present, the cozy situation at United's City Rivale Manchester City is quite different.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's large competitor Pep Guardiola came to an approximate 2:0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through for the home team for the first time the Abwehrriegel des Aussenseiters.
Sergio Agüero made sure of the sixth victory in the seventh game after a good hour and a double pass with the former gatekeeper, as well as the jumping at the table tip.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 low position in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
As with the Cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoners.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, was shortly missing the compensation after 70 minutes.
Better Daniel Sturridge made it in the 89th minute with his slenzer.
So after the reds started with a flawless balance in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the Remis in the Liga, the Blues Liverpool was now also crashing from the table tip.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (at Watford) celebrated 2:0 victories.
However, the fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played, had to wait for a success report to the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford Defender Craig Cathcart buzzed a hereinage by Alex Iwobi unfortunately into his own gate, just two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
As a result of the fifth victory, Arsenal moved by Watford and was just behind the big rival Tottenham on rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave uprising Wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
At 2:0, the clouds stayed unattended at Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and occupied the 8th place.
VW-Kernmark is missing: Paris automobile salon in sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Automobile Salon takes place every two years in Frankfurt on the exchange with the IAA.
Paris - Officially, no topic but all around: The diesel candal and the ringing around driving bans and retrofitting are not expected to release the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 automobile salon, they will show their news from the coming week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not actually play a major role in this.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should still be an important subject at least behind the shining scenes of the exhibition stands.
A great name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electrical models, among other things: the e-tron of the Ingol cities is to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
They were both officially presented.
The iNext of BMW should only start in 2021.
The new 3rd is the centre of Paris.
This year, from 4 to 14 October, more than 250 exhibitors are represented.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, well a million visitors arrived.
During the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are more than 500 injuries.
The island was shocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, there has been enormous damage.
After the shakings, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered on the beach to a festival.
It is feared that the victim numbers are still significantly high.
The figures are only from Palu until now.
However, many other municipalities are affected - along the Sulawesis western coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcycle drivers in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcycles on Sunday.
After all, the Final Divine Service for the Bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the seelsorgeric concerns of the PS-strong two-wheel drivers.
Between April and September, the traditional Motorcycle Gotte Service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at the house Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by bikers in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, on Sunday, about 150 cyclists were gathered to do anything other than ordinary worship.
As early as 10 p.m., the Bolids were set up before the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the Biker's Early Soups were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a thick curry worst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were there.
The sermon held during the Biker-Godsdienst Pfarrer Dirk Grzegorek.
The Singer-Songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical painting.
"Although the bikers prefer the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill is more poetically-sustainable tones," said Pfarrer Frank Schröder.
This was certainly also a novum in the history of the motorcycle gold service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Home Association celebrates large festival: After the apple the milk comes
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pine cakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also raised great interest.
He had his apple press in baggage and demonstrated his astonishing spectators step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children's field and let them fill the apples in the big trigger.
With a little muscle force, the apples became a finely broken mass.
Not many of the children could even imagine how it should be a tasteful drink.
But they could also look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
In shapes packed and surrounded by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the a little bit like hacky pieces of apples layer for layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step in the work was not that much more difficult.
The freshly pressed juice went gradually into a large vessel.
However, the fugitive farmer had already completed specialities.
So he opened his "Schatzkist" and presented to the older visitors the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was accordingly large.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing but also discovered the built hipburg for themselves.
Also active of the fugitive comradeship of former soldiers involved in the festival and invited some stations to short-distance games.
In the following year, the Home Association will also offer an action day.
But then, according to Gregor Krützkamp, the home house in the heart of the Spargeldorf will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth seasonal pilot: "Buffet situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga Niederlage after each other, Trainer André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Profis of Hannover 96 around and spoke courage to them.
However, there was a lot of positive things previously not to be seen at 1:4 (0:2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "That's naturally disappointing, because you always take a lot."
The further victoryless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met, stands down with two counters and is a descent candidate in their current constitution.
According to Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season's home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) achieved the gates for the DFB pocal winner, which, after the successful general sample for the Europe-League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's Vice World Master Rebic was almost involved in any dangerous offensive action of Hessen and never managed by Hanover's defense.
The storms hit after the World Cup showed with its pace and perseverance, why he is so valuable for the indulgement.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan borrowed by the FC Liverpool was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, which began in a vibrant way.
A headball falling on the gate network of Lucas Torró (17th) first posed danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in prospective position at the last moment by the 96-defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer.
The leadership for the housemen fell almost necessarily and completely deserved.
Philip Kostic lifted the ball after a defensive corner into the penitentiary, Haller extended per capita in front of the gate, where Ndicka had to hold the foot.
It was the first Bundesligatrepper for the defense player who came in summer by the French second-party AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time, Haller fitted his storm partner Rebic, who had been able to tank through and left 96-Torwart Michael Esser no chance.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach responded to the weak imagination of his elephant and brought two new offensive forces into Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxony played a little more courageously in front of them, flamming ideas remained shortly before the end, when the trailer was still successful.
The Hessen were much more efficient there.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then moved across De Guzmán, who had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests to run, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes the Party Mile
Würmers Despite cool temperatures, there was good mood at the October festival in the city centre.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter managed it before millions of publications at the opening of the 185.
Municher Wies'n last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geising Christians celebrate Holy-Kreuz-Fest
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Creuz festival on September 14, or on Sunday afterwards.
The festival service takes place in the city church, then is a procession to the Holy Church with the final blessing.
The Church of Holy Creeus hosts the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war on which legend should have shot after a Swedish soldier.
From the gun wound, then blood flowed.
From this a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which led to the construction of the Holy Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar space stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pfarrer Adolf Buhl reminds that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the significance of the Geising parish, worship was badly visited.
After service, the procession to the Holy Church took place and with the final blessing ended the church part of the Crusade.
For many years, the Catholic Church Chor has been invited to the Catholic parish home to the worldly part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adjusted, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered some guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to façade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will take place until next year.
After the preparation has already been made for some time, the damages could be more accurately identified and the individual tenders were more concretely prepared.
It is sure that renovation is more expensive than planned, because the already existing damages have increased several years ago, but it has also been found more, which was only possible by the inaugural appearance by means of pruning.
The socks are finished, before winter, the natural stone work is still to be started and it is hoped that the half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residential home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Danube-Iller life aid opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" will be handed over to its destination - there were all present ones agreed on the date of inauguration.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have been living in the home of the Danube-Iller life aid have been dependent on the special architecture of the new building for some time.
Wider passages, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was placed on the test stand for the residents with cell phonecap: "The house had come into the years and no longer in the equipment," said Bader retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators approached to break down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and brightly as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Aid for Danube-Iller opens new home
About 4.6 million euros invested life aid in new buildings.
The Free State taxed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to Architect Bader, the construction work has remained in the planned framework - both timely and financially.
He also thanked the managing director of life aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagat between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without any other help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, Head of Social Administration of the district of Schwaben, said: "The house is based on the special needs of its residents who need aid to be mobile."
The living and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real luck, because it is no longer available in today's situation."
In total, the new residential home in the Münsterblickstraße offers nearly 1500 square meters space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three living groups.
Pride is the Leader of Life Assistance Heinz on the eleven full-time forces who are all employed according to tariff.
Germany: Silence complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unit, the deputy SPD-Bundesvorsitzender Manuela has called Schweig to all nationals not to find out with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain unit after nearly 30 years.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "day level on Sunday".
The aim must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans in average worked longer than the people in Western Germany but received 15 percent less.
"I can't explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after the German unit," said silence.
North Korea: Does this foolish dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year Pungsan-Jagdhund is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In trying to relax in the relationships with Seoul, Pjöngjang gave the South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungan hunting dogs.
As Moons office reported on Sunday, the two about one year old dogs already reached their receiver on Thursday.
After that, they passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the "inhabitation".
The dogs with the thick white fur, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship had announced the north at the third summit of this year between Moon and the North Korean ruler Kim Jong On mid-September in Pjöngjang.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the test system TonVientianeg Ri for missile drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months since this year, numerous new books have been published, mostly in the back of the past hundred years, to answer this question.
It is quite different to Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archive, in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New Week, new chance for the government
Back to business work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition starting today.
A few interviews, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not sworn the "Return to Business".
This may have led some craftsmen, physicians, cashierers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but it's trumpeted.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself to its task - to governance - it should not be dealt with word debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blamages of the last weeks, it may be possible to show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties meet to the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a teaching from all the disputes.
First of all, however, conflicting issues are on the agenda again with the Diesel Nachrüstungen and the Specialist Immigration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to make the car companies with exchange premiums gently escape, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to re-establish the technical retrofitting of older diesel.
While this crisis has marked an approach over the weekend, Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned professional immigration law.
The SPD demands a stay perspective for rejected asylum applicants who work or do training.
The Union is strictly against the "purchase change" from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will be again disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same, it has joined the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society signed by such a variety of, sometimes contradictory interests does not come forward.
However, in order to be constructive, disputes must not be rebuilt for party-tactic reasons on the question of being or not.
It's still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should fight – but always have the effectiveness of human life in mind.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the trace change question can be resolved pragmatically - and thus recover confidence.
That is why the people now have to fight.
Pilz checked working hours at Hartinger
Minister for Fisheries
Does the Minister of Labour infringe the applicable law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at this more precisely.
"Effective day and night" her legists had been working on social security reform, reported a surplus social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of list-pillar mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprising - she brings the matter to Parliament by request.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and to announce infringements of applicable service law before running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to "promise Har Tinger from any suspicion."
Police rushes up a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - Lange didn't want the police to comment on it.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been buried.
The route is locked until Monday in the Marxgrün area.
It was preceded that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones was finally able to limit the relevant place to a few meters along with his leader in multiple use.
A soil anomaly was also discovered together with scientists of the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian Memorial Protection Authority in the area of the mentioned road.
For more than a year, government and criminal police court have been finishing the loss.
At Marxgrün, a bike path was repeatedly locked and investigated with sonar equipment because the investigators suspect that here, in the course of the new construction of the state road, Heikes body could have been tightened 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Crags in Barcelona before Catalonia
On Monday the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be the first time.
But it's already coming to cruels before.
The separatists have not forgotten the autumn 2017 police use.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of 1 October 2017, it came to collapse between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, with colour powder, as they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the national police and civil warfare.
Around 3,000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues with an announcement, which last year were employed at the illegally classified referendum in the election places.
At the time of attempting to prevent citizens from voting, it had also come to violence.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central government security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the 6000 separatists would then have tried with violence to break the police chain, and the officials, among other things, were thrown up with color bags and eggs.
Six persons had been arrested that 24 others had been easily injured, it was called on the authorities.
On Monday the independence referendum will be the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the wealthy region of Spain, the Central Government in Madrid had placed under force in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also departed from abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement are still in the U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also consists of the "right of self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected Ratelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate themselves torlos
Red-white eels continue to take place.
Also at the FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0-undecided.
The final light and the third last they unpopped before 438 viewers in the Heidewald Stadium as a gathered flawlessness.
The first half was extremely conspicuous of the entertainment factor.
Therefore, if you prefer to pick up a beer or a beer worst, you could do this without concern.
There was no danger of missing a torchance because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
In charge of the first (unharmless) torch of the whole party, Nick Flock's Nick Flock signed in the 28th minute.
The best - and, in principle, only real - possibility had the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penal space limit.
The hosts were even more harmless.
The most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged infringement condition, for Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel aimed almost over the case and after an hour the goods lovers also appeared openly for the first time.
After a ball victory of Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The rapidly presented counter via Sinan Aygün "Krönte" Nick Flock (62.) with a but lazy shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.), they retired after a cornerball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahlener did not achieve.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but also the one didn't get anything.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive point: "I like that we have played at zero," but unfortunately the zero also stood in front.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as still against wooden rods and that even though our opponent had no desire to play here," noted RW Ahlen's interim trainers.
Offensively "thought everything such a bit" against a team that just wanted to defend.
I didn't feel like we could get a countertor," Daut said.
To his suffering, however, as a spectator, they did not feel as if his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too foolish for this.
Reckenfelder Harvest Thanks Market: Fortunately there are enough creimers
This welcomes Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Release Centre for which these donations are intended.
The honourable Members assure: "These donations remain also in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was brilliantly blue, but the place was still empty, but that was to change during the day.
Because: "Here it's so pleasant, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent prize of humor.
For the couple of Brockmann, who had to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer entered in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creimers.
And the "replace" did not take it to talk musically between the ever-increasing visitors.
This was so good that some folk songs were singed at a later hour.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many activities with their stands, including most associations.
"In fact, there shouldn't be something like a table," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men'schorus.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were employed at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town gives you a colorful touch - here's something.
Then, Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took the maize crown with the help of the firearm and took it into the winter quarter.
Many stands have been worked for the physical welfare.
From sweet to heartfelt everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, was created at his dekupiersaw.
Furnier work, beer bottle with rectangular motifs and a lot more he had in offer.
A speciality offered three reckfields of Imker: "Reckenfelder Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschluiter.
The latter has another speciality in it.
Honey cakes in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so well the cake tasted.
The sociality is that the visitors stayed for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Glimbing with local political message: No successful advertising for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknown people have probably hardly promoted the construction of a skate system.
In several places there are smierries, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been sentenced for damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" prang on signs, among other things, at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, Manager of the Halle, reports that after the professional election fair on September 19, a corresponding writing was discovered on the advertisement plate at the staircase rise to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message appeared to have been left "only" with an Edding, they could have been removed easily.
"Some days later, it was back, this time sprayed up," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given just this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the table.
If the skate system is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, Jörg Hesselmann explains from the urban department School, Sports and Culture, without name.
But well possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the decorated table.
For years local policy and administration have been dealing with the issue of skate plant.
After the old had been demolished at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council voted for the fire-fighting park.
However, this insight was not implemented - too many factors seemed to speak against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turn of turning followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the area of Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says to the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word was then the city council.
He goes from a decision this year, so that it could be built with a positive votum in 2019.
Closer air traffic control becomes even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic shaos in summer, the German flight runners do not see any signs of improvement in the next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind, and then the storm will come," said the head of the Air Safety Agency, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency in front of the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-standing need of staff in European airlines, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," said the trade union.
Europe-wide, the market for finished trained lotses is empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized that various air traffic trade unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the Bundes, the countries, airlines, airlines and airports meet in order to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compartment and overtime, this will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in the German Federal Aviation Security.
Maas again made EU Commission specifications responsible for the Lotsen Miseres.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were much too low.
The cost limits and personnel savings derived from them in the national airlines are now fully in line with the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) in Brussels for regulations that "refrain the air".
At present, EU standards would be voted up to 2024 and there would be further tightenings to be feared.
The EU is constantly exposed to the lobby pressure of airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are harvesting exactly what they have sowed themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs of the airlines brought about a rethinking process.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Aviation Security (DFS) offers a "advantaged Training and Future Pact", said Maas.
The up to now announced recording of 120 lottery students over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related courses.

Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board is voting for Group Reconstruction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans for the reconstruction of the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Chief Guido Churchhoff, who was appointed as Chairman of the Board on Sunday, the cruel group is to be split into two independent societies.
Both companies are supposed to have their seat in food and are listed at the stock exchange.
There is no need for additional staff reduction beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
The final decision, however, is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG should include the 50 percent share of the fusioned steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG is intended to bundle the business with lifts and deliverys.
Barcelona: Violence at Demos of Police and Catalan Independenceists.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have brought violent conflicts with numerous injuries.
According to the city administration, some 3000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 advocates of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests away from each other with a great command.
According to the staff, however, independence advocates tried repeatedly to break the security lock.
They would have attacked the officials with color and sausage floors.
According to the data, there were also between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to Rescue Forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told me there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appraisal of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to dignify the colleagues who had been doing almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is unjust that Catalan and Basque police officials deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrant Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they threw us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to give his name only with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our companions who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona, because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.

Football: Juve trainer praises by top party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star storm "has played the best game this evening with the half hour of Valencia," commended Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the expensively purchased star was also without the own gate of the decisive man in the important party against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and makes it good," said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to the three gate templates of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early retirement through the hit of Dries Mertens (10. minute) and initially depended on the worst persecutor.
The Torjäger collected from Real Madrid initially put on the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who managed the lead with a double pack (26/49).
After a corner by headball, Ronaldo also worked on the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had to push in just before the tower line.
"He gives many templates," praised the trainer.
Of course, Allegri wants to see gates of the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the Record Torschütze.
"We need to be better in serving him," the coach asked.
Best Juve Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the overpower of Juventus seems to become even more oppressive.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in series A. At 21 points, the master of the last seven years already has six counters jumping on Naples.
The table line trained by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not unacceptable against Turin.
But at the latest after the reference of the already confused Mario Rui (58.), the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to go hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the place.
"We played well against a good naple," commented the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel there.
The German national player has worked with Juve.
The professional coming from the FC Liverpool was in use for all seven Liga parties.
The middle field actor also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, who meant Allegri with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flying from the place at the 2:0 victory of the Turines and is locked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
With an extraordinary appearance, Rapper Kanye West took attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil pump in a mineral water costume provided for precedence and question marks in the audience.

You can only call him "Ye", the musician says.
"The Being, formerly known as Kanye West," he twittered in response to the deceased singer Prince when he put his artist's name.
The pseudonym, however, is not a news.
The tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most common word used in the Bible and there it means "yes", says the Rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Hutmar's trainer Averhage made no heal from his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simply more aggressive, we have almost never put him in the face of problems." According to the thin list of Hoetmar's funding options.
Grade two torchances in 90 minutes, so you can only rarely make games positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early lead (7.).
In the 43th minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great pre-working by Krause, he was standing free.
The hosts had only a double possibility when Moritz Höne first failed to Torsteher Jo's shoemaker and found his master in the postage Jan Blome.
After the break, guests became more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69,) all gave.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with the hand on the tower line and saw red - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stoke the ball over the line, the party was determined (81.).
"We had been very critical of ourselves before, then it was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus's conclusion.
Send Horst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spektakelball in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he rang after words.
"We didn't get access to them at all." He thought he meant the wing vocals with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-whites that appeared with collective offensive urgency.
However, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, twinkered and pulled from then His players, on the other hand, was the relief to notice that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Noted, after a dual of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class support.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2 as we keep against one of the top teams of the League over the whole time of the game, that was really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you have to go home with empty hands.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side mustardly for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but one of these players can't be taken out completely.
"That was crazy what he did," Lewandowski confessed the opponent's quality in vain.
Shortly before the side change, his own elephant managed to compensate: McGill's left-hand release sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe to the long distance (45.).
After the side change it was again McGill, who achieved the compensation (59.).
After that, it went and there.
It was a cracky, action-loaded game.
Nübel again shocked albachten (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann liked (69.).
Despite surcharge, Albersloh was no longer able to reconcile the last Concordia-Treffer (80.).
We must now focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against shapes, that's what we need to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröher (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tores: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhne (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).

Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers around 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Consequently, France's President Emmanuel Macron signaled that he wanted to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff the term of office was too short: he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy as federal president.
But before and afterwards, Wulff was a guest there.
Thus, academic director Udo Hahn, who proudly said: "All federal presidents and Chancellors were already with us." The fact that at the Akademie in Tutzing Castle were always presenting prominents was also an issue in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, Songmacher Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has promised that he will personally accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which also receives TV moderator Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The around 80 meetings until mid-2020 have it in itself.
"The pension is not sure!" stands in a meeting title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - so the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And at a meeting on Syria: "Barbarei without limit".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war devastates every human idea".
From structural racism in society through the scissors between the poor and the empire to the radical change in the work of digitization, the spectrum ranges.
Academy Director Hahn convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to search for solutions or at least for partial solutions."

Music cabaret: gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - West Fälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for adults as well as for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christkirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret tester, Teubner suggested gender understanding, not only with humor and heart warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar set her up and mastered her violin as well.
At the wing, Ben Süverkrupp was sitting.
This is one of the male savings partner who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, one true pianist: So congenially accompanied Süverkrupp Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
That was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, as it fitted with the red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had brought a paradoxon into play: the satisfaction of the man, if he has a partner, but this does not make up the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have emerged from the composer Mozart's, "the Nannerl" would have unheartedly opened the door?
Thus, Süverkrüpp passes over in improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" into the "Lied of Death", and from Mozart g-mol symphony into a playful dance.
There were big applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers delivered Karlheinz Klein, Treasure Master of the Association, the Chansonette.
But the Chairman Heidemarie Brandbeck was not able to take an additional thanks.
She had the idea of enjoying one in Wolbeck in addition to the Duo in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

"The Mosque opening in Cologne has left a shelf in the German-Turkish relationship that can only be toughly gathered," said the Chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, Germany's editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the opportunity for a common, comprehensible appearance.
"To underline the belongings of the Muslims to Germany by side with German leaders, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The broad exclusion of the German public has "promoted many reservations".

On 18 October (Donderstag) at 19.30 p.m., the Home Association Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost on the day it's a year ago that we've done a folklore for the first time.

From pure fruit construction to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the Circular Association was celebrated for gardening and national care.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbach club house, the final incentive for the district association for gardening and land care of Kulmbach was set, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a great anniversary in the city hall of Kulmbach on Saturday evening.
At that time, he was named differently: "Country Sovereign Association of Kulmbach City and Country" he was lifted from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-building association was also different from today's work - it was actually about fruit-growing, flowers and gardening at that time, no one thought.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimpfleger Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees should be aside distance roads, schools have been built so-called industrial gardens.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 gardening clubs in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise nearly 7000 members.
But with this the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A naturally horticulture, biological plant protection, village beauty and nutrition play an equally important role as providing knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
How versatile the tasks of a garden-building association are, the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Mulwürfen" showed entertaining on stage.
"Youth work is urgently necessary especially in the digital age," said the circuit chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The chestnut collection was a giant thing for us children, I doubt that you can gather similar joy with smartphone & Co..
Sharm promised to plant two trees together with the Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are to stand, the circuit association decides", added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The circuit association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many gardening clubs in the district, which also made no doubt about circular business leaders and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the circuit association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Previously, everything came out of the garden, it was put in for the winter.
At the end of the 50s, however, the garden had changed to a circular and residential garden.
"The nature has persistence, it was before us and we have to focus on her," pleaded the specialist for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is the urgency for the gardening clubs not to leave so that our home is beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, the president of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the eclatant decline in insects, we owe our children and grandchildren," closed Günter Reif the successful festival, which was ceremonially surrounded by the towers of the music club Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN-Rede
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: They make both trading partners an ultimatum for agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and moves her speech before the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure when ringing for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking to the United Nations on Saturday, the Minister will only speak Monday before the United Nations Assembly, her speaker Adam Austen informed.
In the meantime, she concentrates on the renegotiation of Nafta.
On Friday, the Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, explained that the negotiators of Canada and the USA had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between his country and the USA.
The United States and Mexico had agreed on a recast of the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement in August.
U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The discussions on a new edition have been running for over a year.
Until Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be concluded, Trump's government wants to present the agreement before 1 October to the US Senate.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday to seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, left the hospital.
According to a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo" the ex-military of the law wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on open road at the beginning of September during a election event in Southern Brazil.
At the same time, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people went to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not"), women's associations had called protests against the ex-military.
Also in the social networks, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and female despising statements mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis São Paulo.
In the capital of Brasilia, protests were mixed with an announcement of the presidential candidates of the Brazilian workers party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by Ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment for corruption and is therefore not allowed to compete.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As ex-burgermaster of the million city of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro in surveys.
Although the "Trip of Brazil" has been mixed in the political operation for a long time, it is presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there is a vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not be successful from this - no matter who he does.
Bolsonaro is known for he hates against homosexuals and blacks and glorifies the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He repeatedly shocks with verbal glidings.
Another time he said that the trailers of Lulas left working party should be shot.

Rocknight in the shoe factory: Volume on pressure air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and fire a concert evening with the power of a tiger."Only the band names of "Herre We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" make such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the room of the citizen center Shoes factory near: Hardrock pur by three other friends.
After the sound check and just before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from eels and surroundings - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - loudly enthusiasm the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" Rock Night.
The "Tiger Bonesaw" quartet with Frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from its own spring and the next CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced at the appearance of the stimulant and impressive interplay.
Although "access" ropes are not to be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the Trio "Lord We Stand".
The fact that hardrock is not the same as hardrock shows guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternatives, sometimes with classical rock in the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" adds a synthesizer to the guitar rock.
Not only is the longing, balloading "Take Me Home" awarded by the change of melodic passages to the guitarous rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" made of tonesque has played a special degree of acquaintance since its founding in 2005.
Full agility the band presents her hardrock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with their performances in front of a very large audience - youngest in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - has documented special stage experience is obvious and unchanged.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also puts his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Gitarrist Norbert Brinkmann has a rejoiced solo that he runs through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume belongs to such a hardrock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the Mixpult team at the Trinity Concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at press air hammer level, but is thus still clearly under the controls of the "wacken-Fesitval" pointing to "The ignition" on their website.
Ear decibels 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume as usual at the annual metal thickness in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlener audience does not need this rock night.
After nearly four hours, the three bands of the harder rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.

The pilot died in the calamity.

Trump inhibits Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the U.S. President of North Korea's Chief Kim is quite well-founded despite nuclear crisis is not a secret.
But now Trump has made his colleague a genuine declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the age of 72, the married president of the U.S. has become a new flame.
The tragedy: It's a remote relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made Kim Jong Un an unusual declaration of love to North Korean power on the public.
In front of pendants in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old splash of the reign dynasty from Pjöngjang, although in the rings around North Korea's nuclear disarmament proves to be quite tough.
"I was hard, he too, and it went between us," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have brought his heart to melting.
He wrote to me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also been politically fruitful: Trump pointed to the stop announced by Kim of all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics see little more than lip confessions.
That the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - whether its martial threats are not supposed to be any more memory, it seemed to be conscious of the US president.
At any rate, he took the expected criticism of this when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have been in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresidential.
But he cares very little, Trump explained and then directed his wise finger to the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidial."
But then there wouldn't push 10,000 people out there into this stupidly filled arena, but we only had 200 people out there.

Refugees saved from libyschem prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees, using a mobile video, have pointed to their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya and thus allowed their rescue.
The group had turned the recording in her cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under life risk and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flew to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya when attempting to reach the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life, according to his own statement.
One of his competitors was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the detention conditions were catastrophic: "They all beat us with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees who are struck in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria had been sent back to their homes this year using the program, said the IOM speaker in the Western African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now saved Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a help call by phone video so far.
International organisations have long been criticizing the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human beings.
The North African state, which is dominated by too large parts of militia, is the main country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

Laschet admonishes the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Minister-President Armin Laschet (CDU) urged the rule of law in Turkey in the discussion with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations of the two countries are currently "overshadowed," said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns especially the waves of arrest, the press and religious freedom.
In Erdogan, he has therefore made "that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that it is a very important prerequisite for the rule of law".
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey, according to their own information.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of opinion would be respected.
Erdogan then reiterated the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a short-term building of the Flight Preparation of the Federal Ministry of Defense at the Cologne Airport.
Originally it should have been held on Castle Wahn - but the castle owners had refused from political conviction against Erdogan.
After the discussion, Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib Moschee in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Missing trust in the USA: North Korea demands disarmament
While U.S. President Trump will not be tired of emphasizing the successes in the negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri demands a presence of Washington.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has proposed the US Government at the UN General Debate to block the negotiations for a nuclear-wave-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest ceases, therefore, that the US builds on forced measures that are fatal for the formation of trust," said Ri in New York.
In these circumstances, disarmament would be unacceptable to North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the USA, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to escape ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat issued.
That North Korea's penalties could "force knees" would be "a dream of wishes of people who don't know us".
In order to build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test plant, Ri highlighted.
However, from the US side there were no "according reactions", criticized the Minister.
Due to North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone decided three times last year on sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo in recent days urged the United Nations to strictly respect the criminal measures.
At the same time, the US government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's powermen Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the President of the United States is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October Pompeo will return to Pjöngjang for discussions on the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors to the house of the open door HoT did not get anything: White blankets and flower decoration on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after harvest thanks service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacy from different countries in the new cuisine.
The establishment was financed by donations from the community for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators with foods and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break, the evil surprise came: a power failure had set out the huge, two-part refrigerator, the food was corrupted and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the front: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so they all packed.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"The better is that it can't be cooked," a visitor was impressed, while Hokkaido cube soup was served or the guests were allowed to use quake, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have put on their legs," emphasized Pfarrer Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other pieces of art awesome.
Jürgen Sator leaves the national board NRW of the table
The head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has issued his post in the state association from frustration about criticism from his own series.
Sartor had become known all over the country because the Essener Table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice Chief of the NRW-Tapels, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen too many in my back.
The head of the NRW Table Country Association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding of the decision of his long-term alternate.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
"I can follow up his step - there people who didn't know exactly why the Essener Table does this."
Sartor is still active for the Essener Table - "six days a week, there is nothing changing," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday" Sartor criticized criticism at colleagues from other tablets.
You cannot follow the approach "without us starving the people in the city".
It was the government's duty to ensure that humans did not starve.
The Essener did not attend at a convention of the tablets on Friday in Berlin.
"There is told me too much sweet shit," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that have criticized me at that time.

Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets newly from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had acted against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half of the time, it was a 4-2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) like a doublette inside four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63st minute, provided another doublet in the final phase (86./94).
The first victory was the VfB Stuttgart.
Against the yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, Werder Bremen had to fear in the meantime before the break.
Borna Sosa and the unremarkable Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabrated a curiose cast-owner that helped the guests to compensate for in the 68th minute.

After seven rounds, Gladbach occupies the 4th place.

Macedonian votes on new state names

The voters therefore also decide on the future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could become rapidly Nato member at a positive outcome of the referendum.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend

On Saturday, the two gave themselves the yes in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been in question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "Image" newspaper.

Fortunately the perpetrators failed.
The days will be shorter - that's what wants to take advantage of breakers.
Thus, the police inspection Gauting mentioned yesterday the first attempt to break this autumn.
It is due to the alarm system that it has remained on the one family house on the Königswieser Straße.
It went off when the offenders put hand on Friday just 20 a.m.
The inmates knew that the inhabitants weren't at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they escaped without a prey.

Pleite bei Hertha: Recovered from reality: Bavaria demanded against Ajax
The predicate is indecisive: The defeat in Berlin wants to "not let the FC Bavaria go".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate phase for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance drum under the new Coach Nico Kovac is not supposed to increase to the larger natural depth for the Munichers.
"One week ago one had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we've got a bit of the reality," Thomas Müller noted after the earned 0:2 low position at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction to the Champions-League-Doll with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us, who knows that we're really angry and we're going to gas in the direction of Tuesday.
For the first time for more than a year, no one shot out his own gate, like at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory, the recording in the Football League first lost on Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensive man-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches across the outside have delivered two blue breaks within three days, as the most overpowered Bavaria can be knocked.
"Those who know the FC Bavaria know that we won't let ourselves do this and we will do all we can to be successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, he and his losers in his birth town, however, were surprisingly gentle and pushed his first defeat as Munich Coach only on the reverse lack of dealing with opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday, before the country break, the first intermediate phase of his term would nevertheless have been positive - otherwise the sound would probably be sharpened.
So Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second king's class performance of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which had also forced the AEK Athens sovereign with 3:0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our gates again," announced Manuel New National Team Headquarters.
As already after the lost pocalfinals against incoherence Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clear text.
The defender of law appeared in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think this is all pech, we have to work it again, because we don't make the variety of chances and make the mistakes behind," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous game, the Bavaria was already behind Dortmund with five counters, which has now taken the top again with a point of advance.
And horizon with an eye dwindling at least appreciated positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now reached an end.
"Yes, that's good before," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Schusslinie: Özil-Causa: Sharp Attack from Erdogan to Grindel
With heavy accusations, Turkish President Erdogan prescribes an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation of the permanent issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President for the opening of the great Ditib Moschee in Cologne heavily criticized the treatment of the ex-world champion in Germany, the DFB Chief defended the association line.
In the early Sunday morning, the Grindel attacked by Özil personally in the Mainzer ZDF-"Sportstudio" announced consequences from the Causa.
"There we must draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U-Managements - that something is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
This had in sharp words condemned racism to Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, born in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they have been photographed with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the Domstadt.
Honestly, as her president, I could not digest that our two young men, who rose up to the German national team, were excreted.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil, he felt "reasonable by DFB" after the World Cup affiliate, which had taken its beginning through photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to stand before players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm migrant - that's not going.
"I regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more, I've always said that.
A basis for a return of Özils to the national team, however, he does not see.
As a result, in addition to Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer will now be called.
"If there is one without a migration background that works clearly into society and soccer and says: "The topic is important, we have to take care of," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on site where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Özil-Affaire, he wants to go back to the office as DFB President in the next year.
"I make my work and try to make her as good as it is," said Grindel.

On Saturday, the two gave themselves the yes in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been in question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "Image" newspaper.
If we get married, right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a spokesman of the SPD-Bundestagsfraction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD flight.
In the federal debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs was excited on June 30, 2017 with a speech of anger.
So he had provoked Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU).
"That was your schabowski-moment," he said in anticipation of the accidental announcement of the Günter Schabowski GDR-Grenzöffnung.
Since 1 October 2017, equal sex couples have been able to marry exactly like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right to adopt.
Started referendum in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the highly expected referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Approximately 1.8 million voters are supposed to decide whether their state is to be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the neighbour of Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens has blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and the Nato.
If the citizens vote with yes, they will also give the start of the Western integration of their country.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donations and to relieve family members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change that organs may continue to be taken with express consent only, stresses Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and to relieve family members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in death can be registered there.
Your wishes are then available in the case of Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that institutions can continue to be taken, as in Germany, only with express consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card will be found at a decisive moment when possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, family members do not know the desire of the deceased.
"Then you have to decide deputyly in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donations on the health insurance card, as the spokesman of the Federal Center for Health Intelligence, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can enter their wishes - per or contra organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has voted for a new regulation of organ donations.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered organ donors unless he or his family contradicts.
Among other things, the Catholic Church refuses to do so.
14-year-old pupil is world champion in calculating
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion.
He continued in the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper was informed of the Phaeno Science Museum, the site of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Gruß from Germany occupied the third place.
The latest WM participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest of an 74-year-old pensioner from France, as the main judge Ralf Laue said.
The computer professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants responded to guests from the audience with calculator.
Wenzel Greet from Lastrup demonstrated how he held a ball with his head in the air when he ran.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Greeting was already attended two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With concepts such as superhire, genius or miracle child, organizers can not start lauw.
"You can train headcalculation," he said.
Many participants exercised several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stage-oriented computation competitions.
One of the disciplines is, for example, the square root pulling from six-digit numbers.
During the multifaceted calculation, the candidates receive surprise tasks for which they need to find a solution strategy quickly.
Here the Germans would also have good chances, said the main judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage of learning more intensive and effective methods in early childhood.

Polare cold air brings new snow on the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shake out her beds next week in the West for the first time: Polare Kaltluft reaches on Monday Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres - in narrow valleys it could cut down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzer Forest to the High Tauern is expected to be 20 to 40 inches of new snow above 2,000 meters.

Farmers may begin with the annual knick care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers may begin with the annual knick care on Monday.
The unique "green rolls" in Germany have been characterizing the landscape of the forestly poor state for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree and straps are "worm set" and for many animals and plants the last withdrawal spaces.
Knicks connect spaces that are scattered as a corridore, which can still work through the exchange of organisms, as the managing director of the Nature Protection Association of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the basis of a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitation and cattle fence, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and bars for their specialized houses.
From that time also comes his name "Knick": By "cicking" the branches have been able to develop the dense, confused demarcations.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea stretches around 45 000 kilometers of the hooks and presents the image of a wooden, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a spare habitat of some 7000 species.
In one kilometer of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and up to 30 bird pairs could breed.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he spills into a light tree series, which, besides the variety of species, also reduces the effect of wind protection, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Knick Care may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about SItuation on site
The local Radika Pinto describes the local situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami in the interview with the editorial network of Germany (RND):
Were you on site during the Tsunamis itself?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then when I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport was closed on Palu at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flew in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which are completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have something provisionally set up where we have also housed other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have been run on surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some keep up in front of their houses, there are still predators.
Because many food shops and also the tank stations are completely closed, people are partly clawing food and petrol.
The public service has been completely discontinued, the national government helps out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners run freely around and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island running?
At the moment we have handy reception, but before it didn't work and we got information only over the radio.
Many people are still searching for their children, neighbors, and other people who do not know whether they live and where they are, for example, because people were travelling at work, not at home during the earthquakes.
The Tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that have not been hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they have been run to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Fire Ring, prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst thing here.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit very many people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI inspection in the turbot rate
The time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
With a FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the thin majority for the judicial candidates of Brett Kavanaugh who are controversial about the need.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the suspected incidents over 30 years.
The recent turn in the drama around the call of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the jurist wrestled against the oppositional democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the Erzconservative Judge at the Supreme US Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demand a FBI investigation.
After tumult-like scenes, his party friends consented.
President Trump, who called the heavy pretense on Thursday as "decisive", first contained further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happy in calamity".
In this way, last doubts could be eliminated, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the democrats in a election, because they refused Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump ordifies FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One will investigate the well-known accusations of two women, not more, said a government representative to the "Wall Street Journal": "They don't go to a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four Witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar equipment installed in a "civil vehicle" of the city municipality of Ried for monitoring the tempo limit is stationed on the garden road as from Monday, October 1st, according to the city community.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: One felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season win.
However, against Mainz, the factor time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, Christian Heidel is known as a huge pessimist in football games.
That was not different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
Finally, the king's blues were still able to bring the bare 1:0 against the Rhine hats over time and thus the first seasonal victory under roof and specialist.
It could actually have happened differently.
After the leadership of Alessandro Schöpfe 11 of the team of Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco had given Tedesco security: "In sum, the first half time was good, both playful and from pressing.", apparently, with increasing play time, the head played an increasingly role.
Actually don't create a headball enormous
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," he said, "If the team was only half as nervous as I am on the bank, I can understand it."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore continue to withdraw.
And with man and mouse defended against Mainz.
To save the first three counts of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpfe, who had no inevitable share in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man's ship."
But at the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the beginning and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can be happy for a few hours.
I'm very happy for the team and fans.
We have played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to go to parties over 90 minutes
The probably largest manco of the afternoon: King's blue missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the Latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a victory," said Tedesco, "you already felt the fear a little."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only shalker.
Fischbachau: Smoking column in the Lead Zachtal 2 km visible

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye height
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani, is in front of them.
He followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild for the repeated time.
"I have made it a task for many years to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - that association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani gets into the reading very loose, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic understandable.
With a lot of skill, hand-resistant numbers and one or other joke, he brings the listeners to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses to answer the question of a metaphor.
At one table the German society sits, on the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to vote.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not essential whether to arrange itself politically on the right or on the left, but: "I am for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first, rather behave, then more and more the discussion round is going on.
And there is a need for talk.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or failed integration in pupils.
El-Mafaalani stands ahead, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is at eye height.
The professor of sociology does not insist on his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fate.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "first when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing time, he has also been an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, in the case of prepared Kurdish specialities, more intensively discussed.

So Schalkes Naldo also manages "great sports" at the bank
For the third time not in the startelf: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had seated for the third time, not in the Schalker Startellf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the nearly two-metre Brazilian had spoken the frustration of the soul.
But after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, when the Schalker players gathered in the middle and chef trainer Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who all called simplicity half Naldo, joined and said: "We have to thank, Trainer!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," later Tedesco said about the reaction of his Vice-Chapter, who, despite his re-reservist existence, had no resentment.
Truly, Naldo, who was celebrated as the best shalker during the past season, knows that he has actually not been on the slot of his trainer - but has a break for good reasons.
A reason called "Steuersteuerung".
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you very honestly," told Tedesco of the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the runaway.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," founded Tedesco the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can snip right now.
And that we all keep in the boat," said Tedesco the rotation which has last caught Naldo.
And to what the Brazilians responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proved to be an exemplary team player at the bank.
In August, the mood in Austria's industry continued to speed up its traffic compared to the eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was located at 46.7 points on a 37-month depth.
However, throughout Europe Austria has the third best vote behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute informed on Monday on his survey among 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the Euro-Zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is therefore the 13th month in a row below the brand of 50 counters, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry knocked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
Final light were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain the mood barometer decreased, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index has reached the highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit-Ökonom Rob Dobson.
However, industry - at least in the third quarter - remains growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have no longer fallen as strong as since November 2011.
Therefore, the companies declined the seventh month in succession of posts.
In China too, industrial production decreased more than initially assumed in August.
The mood barometer decreased from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had first expected 47.8 points.
The shopping manager index supports its figures on representative surveys by 3,000 European industrial companies.
The developments in turnover, employment, warehouses and prices will be raised, among other things.
