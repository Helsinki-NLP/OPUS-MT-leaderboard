Members of the Wales National Assembly will be ‘compared to Muppets’
There is a revelation among the members of the Wales National Assembly by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of several political parties are concerned that the new name is ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP "drives on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the Wales National Assembly of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is ‘unsatisfied’ and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party is ‘open’ for the change of name, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short you.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently working on the drafting of legislation to implement the change in name, said: ‘It are, of course, the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.’
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the Wales National Assembly were entitled to amend the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly had to be converted to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option was most supported in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach a consensus and must submit a legislative draft on the changes in a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms also includes other amendments to how the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will finally be able to vote on their new title when discussing legislation.
Residents of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, voters vote whether they want to change their country's name to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a stirring dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim to its territory and has repeatedly objected to requests from Macedonia to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the change of name, said that he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is just the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem have difficulty
“The older people I spoke to said that there was a café and a church in every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café here nor a church."
He said it's understandable that cafés have disappeared.
"People have social contact now in a different way," he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people go regularly.’
However, he is worried that the revenue from the sale of the assets of the churches will be less long than the leaders expect, ‘and leave them early or later at the beginning.’
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people would not help in the remaining refugees of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to the close of these churches even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these apartments become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church church led by Eerwaarde John Howard Johnson, who led a boycot from the shoppers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building became serious damage by fire, but when the parishioners of Eerwaarde Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a beard.
Honored David Johnson, the son of Eerwaarde Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, called the beard proud 'the bells of the poor'.
The expert who played the beard in July referred in another way to the instrument: “a cultural treasure” and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beard in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger beard of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the leak leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of leak leaders) wrote the bishop in July to express her concern that the bishop would want to ‘calculate the cost’ to the consistency, although the consistency had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had sent the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of diocese transparency.
Hai wounds 13-year-old who lobsters in California
Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who lobstered in California. The boy rose injuries, as it says.
The attack took place just 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had spent about half an hour on Saturday with friends when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others, he peddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy cried because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized “that the boy cried: ‘ I’m begged!
I'm bited!"
His keybone was completely open," Hammel saw when he approached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone should go out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!'.
The boy was brought with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he reportedly was in danger of life.
It's not a conscience which kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Beach Guard Captain Larry Giles told in a press conference that a shark was ridiculed some weeks before, but that it was then concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured to the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury wants to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and set up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in large-scale houses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to drop, and the larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops throughout the country.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the racks where TVs, microwaves and interior products were ever standing with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing gamma of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gets more place, with table by brand, such as in shops as Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up again on the market, since most products are suitable for veganists, something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumerie the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first was opened in Croydon, south of London, the second is opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and buy small quantities of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like large warehouses, now that the supermarket chain records it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have increased efficiency.
The last time the supermarket tried to give his departments Cleanness and Apotheek a make-over, it became a flop.
At the beginning of the 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a cooperation with Boots, but the cooperation was terminated when there was a conflict on the distribution of revenue from the pharmacy department in supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments in the shops three years ago for a total of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have completely changed the establishment of our beauty department so that this is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialised training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our brand offer, we offer for everyone something, and thanks to the attractive environment and the convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shopping in the old way."
Peter Jones 'woeding' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'woeding' because TV-presentator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle business. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presentatrice of This Morning announced she leaves at Instagram.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is raging on Holly Willoughby, because she has withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “woeding” when Willoughby was on Tuesday at a difficult meeting in the main establishment of the Marlow company, Buckinghamshire announced that she did not retain enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories, because of her new contracts (with a value of up to a half million pounds).
The company is compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and would probably double Willoughby's fortune of an estimated £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced at Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure her future in the long term and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was surprised when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The warehouse of the main establishment in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrice, one of the most profitable stars in Great Britain, could cost the company millions, due to large investments in products from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now rise further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been well-friended with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became President of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones shares 40 percent in the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby will soon become brand ambassador of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presentation of the programme I'm A Celebrity on the British broadcaster ITV.
A source from Jones's entourage said last night: ‘We have no comment on his business affairs.’
Hard language 'and then it was love between us'
He joke about the criticism he would receive in the media for a comment he made that some people would find “inappropriate for a president” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I didn't give up anything."
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the decommissioning of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been held.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a 'accordable reaction' by the United States after the first defence initiatives in North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues with its penalties to keep pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We're doing very well in North Korea," he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results, and rocket tests have ended, hostages have been released, and the material surpluses of American military have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach with regard to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get access to this busy arena, about 200 people would stand here,” Trump said, while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island with hundreds of deaths
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had no more home, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for launching international aid.
"In many cases it is unfortunately clear that they do not request international aid, which is difficult for us," said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is working on compiling a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure if the foreign aid providers can work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the Agency for Assistance at National Disasters, said that Indonesian officials were still working on evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be given permission to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh shelters were built to hide at tsunami's, but along other coasts you see these but rarely.
That there was no warning of tsunamis in Palu, even though a warning was of effect, has probably contributed to the number of dead.
It can also be difficult in ideal circumstances to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat earthquakes victims is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reached the place of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's portless infrastructure was one of the key points of the election campaign of President Joko Widodo, and he has already spent abundantly much money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko faces a shortage of funding, while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a previously conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their home because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting on the street, with machets, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge van Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge protected Liverpool last Saturday for loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was behind with 1-0.
He knocked left against the ball and then shot in the direction of the distant stake.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, in the direction of the right top corner of the net.
He escaped the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw edge approaching and daring a attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked on the ball.”
Chelsea stood at the rest with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues spits the ball with its heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the middle field to the Liverpool playback.
Kovacic did a fast one-two in the middle field.
Then he gave a beautiful stitch pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and shot the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back stake.
Liverpool plays Wednesday at 15 a.m. at the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli, in the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes it in London at 15 a.m. against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Tsunami death in Indonesia runs up to 832
The number of deaths of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen up to 832, said the agency for assistance in national disasters on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 from last Friday, with waves of 6 m high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrests 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman has died
This morning a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. The body showed sting wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask the local residents to report if they have seen or heard something.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation has just started, but I want to all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular cab drivers, to contact if they may have filmed something through a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who thought they knew the woman on the spot to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is running, and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
The inhabitants are now told that it will take hours to return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She keeps repeating, "What a bad!".
At 14 p.m., two police cars were inside the station and a third just stood out.
Within the station, a number of officers kept an eye on the apartment building.
Those with information will be asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call to 101 or contact anonymously with Crimestopers on the number 0800 555 111, with the entry of log 247 of 30 September.
Statue of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'reriting history'-rel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic puritein followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr. Crick as 'dwaas' and 'a attempt to rewrit the history'.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the fishing of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses or Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the past century.
The magnificent image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many believe should still receive recognition.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course, the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely right picture, it is still debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has formed the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered."
Killing Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in the southwest of China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, known only by the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province. His artery was drilled and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer is prepared to vaccinate pigs at a pig stable on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He was said to have traveled from Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday with his cousin.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and proved to be open to a neighboring pig.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth in the pig cake.
A forensic study showed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeded and mutilated,” said the cousin with the last name ‘Wu’, according to Guiyang Evening News newspaper.
Monitoring cameras show that Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
It is said that Yuan's family and the market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs that attack people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the husband to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife fired the animal.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can attract aggression.
“They are just plays.
They're like kids, very curious, they're not trying to hurt people.
You just need to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of the hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the USA
As predicted, hurricane weakens Rosa as it has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and southwest.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a local hurricane of category 1 on Sunday morning at 5 a.m. and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form above the Pacific, moving eastward to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, southwest of the USA.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days widespread.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and potential earth shifts in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert on foot when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can overturn ravines into desolate rivers, and thunderstorms will locally produce winds and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rain is possible of 1.5 cm, which could lead to small debris flows and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rainy season.
Dispersed tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rain is spread more on Monday at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate strongly, because the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropics remain quite hot.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the ongoing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the middle and east of the United States, it is expected that October would begin warm, with temperatures that fluctuate around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can become Tuesday 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecasts show that the risk is high until mid-October at above average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched on one of the six television networks on Thursday the dramatic testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault reportedly took place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for the Friday surprise: an agreement agreed by Jeff Flake, Arizona senator, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senates Committee on Justice that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was infecting her and tried to pull her clothes out during a high school celebration.
Kavanaugh declared in an incredible testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who have been reported by Nielsen have watched on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not immediately figures available for the other networks that sent out the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at an office.
In comparison, that is about like for a playoff of a football contest or for the Oscar broadcast.
Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh's appointment, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS registered on Friday morning that demonstrators screamed to him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Committee on Justice.
He stood a few minutes with slain eyes while he was shamed, live on CNN.
"I'm right here for you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone called, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and closed right before the elevator, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels sent out everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the fact that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominated against the next week, something which the Democrats of the minority insisted on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened a FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union from ‘a political game’ with the future of Great Britain and the undermining of national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson emphasized his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's charges was 'absurd'.
Shooting Party Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the player of LSU
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketballer at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and was imprisoned at suspicion of death, said Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police asked Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is fixed at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The body viewer of the municipality in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a shot wound in the neck.
The report mentions that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the Criminal Lab of State Police, the Southern University Police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva from LSU thanked the local police for ‘introducing and striving for justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm wide and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He won an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU-basketbalcoach Will Wade said that the team 'kapot' and 'in shock' were dead by Waydes.
"This is an event you always hope it will never happen," says Wade.
Volcano sprays as in Mexico City
The axis that is sprayed out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern areas of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Ramping Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was picked up in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were registered in 24 hours.
The center detected several times junk and vibrations.
On social media, pictures of a thin layer of ashes appeared on authors in districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres south-east of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 on the Richter's central Mexico scale.
The volcano, called ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police conflicts with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists succeeded in raising politics, while thousands of participates in rival demonstrations at the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the revolt police furnished the agents with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds to emerge in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, screen buckets broke out with the police, and the officers picked up their knife to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour pro-independence groups sang: 'Don't forget, don't forgive', while their opponents called 'Lang live Spain'.
Fourteen people were treated for light injuries that they suffered during the protests, the local press reported.
The tensions continue to rise high in the independence region, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separate Catalans.
The voters spoke overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people against separation were the vote boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year nearly 1,000 people were wounded after the police had tried to stop the vote in the region’s voting offices, with violent screenings.
Pro-independence groups had camped on site the night of Friday on Saturday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
“We had one of our most beautiful moments last year.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved a fundamental victory in the regional elections in December, even though that was nipped, it was difficult for them this year to build on their success, because many of their most famous leaders are absent, either in their own imprisonment or in captivity, in awaiting a legal case on their role in organizing the referendum and expulsion of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old machine who filmed the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been raised by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are increasing," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in provision since the end of last year, declared that he participated in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the deterioration of the democratic values and repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed with a car
Three men from 33, 34 and 39 years old were arrested after a car was catered repeatedly in a home in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent at about 19.30 a.m.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building had damaged themselves.
Perhaps a crossbow has also been fired on the car at one point.
Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to the goal of Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and the team of Gary Holt came to the same height with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team did not succeed this season in winning a competition during the Premiership. They have to record the Sunday against leader Hearts, who represents eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers Rapid Vienna receives Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston stays unsaved. The team won six games after each other in his department, and trainer Holt hasn't had any defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston Missing Opportunities to Strong Visitors
Holt's team could have achieved a jump long before the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused various problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but did not succeed in finishing it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who lifted the headball of Craig Halkett, the ball above the target.
The home team gave the Rangers a lot of fun to play, and waited for his chances quietly and self-assured.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free step and Livingston made an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the penal zone.
At that time, the Rangers had been holding balls for a long time, but the defense of the home team was inappropriate and targetman Liam Kelly hadn't had to do much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly had to prevent a goal.
Scott Pittman shot the ball against the feet of Rangers' targetman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a suggestion of his colleagues in Livingston.
Ongoing, the penalty of Livingston was proclaimed, but they were vended each time. Two times a penalty cop was refused, one after Halkett's attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' of Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellent without exception and continue to exceed the expectations in their race to the top.
Their playstyle and the composition of their team have almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has swept up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes during the game.
The Rangers, however, did not know how to break through.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they managed only once to make up the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they should play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a shiny blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went breakfast Saturday (29 September) together in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO-partners.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left to Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they stopped the crowd of 25,000 people to gather themselves for the mosque, but many sympathists came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurden, also heard their voice, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as autocratic.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the crossing point of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago another cyclist died in an accident with flight crime on Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers would inform the man and his closest family.
The road is closed in various places, buses are redirected and automobiles are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six ciphers injured in order disruption
Six ciphers have been wounded in an order disruption in a severely secured prison for men, according to the prison office.
The turbulences broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ ciphers have been used to solve situations involving eight in one section.
The ciphers were treated place for light injuries in the face.
A spokesman of the prison system said: “Specially trained prison staff have been employed for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and the responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind tralies longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had been treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the reluctance police were called to prison for a serious disruption in order to attack staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with potentially positive effects on drought areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa moves across the southwest of the desert area, which poses risks for flooding.
For Monday and Tuesday the National Weather Service has already given warnings for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang Tuesday just above Phoenix. Monday night it will already rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix observed in a twot that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.'
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For the areas that do not risk flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, because the southwest currently suffers a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are indicated, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona spends at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the continent through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa is still on hurricane strength with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm strikes cooler waters in the Pacific, which weakens them.
That is why it is expected to arrive in Mexico in the afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm.
There may be heavy rain in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
‘A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,' reported weather.com.
Rosa moves northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona in the early morning hours as a tropical depression, which will then be late Tuesday evening by Arizona and south of Utah.
“The greatest risk expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert area” said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and debris flows in the deserts and earth shifts in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempt to kill
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempts to kill after a 16-year-old was found with stitch wounds in Somerset.
The teen was injured at about 4 o'clock in the district of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton.
He was brought to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to the police of Avon and Somerset.
The police ask anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has suffered 'under the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
'A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactic of the Democratic Party', Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered constantly under the commonness, the anger of the Democratic Party during his appointment procedure
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Congress Thursday and denied strong and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford’s assault that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford has also witnessed her ascension during the hearing.
On Saturday the president said that the “American people saw the beautiful and incredible character, the quality and the courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice recognized by one of the most fully-enforced legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service," he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
“One of the most important elections in our lives takes place over five weeks.
I don't participate, but actually I'll take part," he said.
‘This is why I come up everywhere for great candidates.’
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to 'resist and impede us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be expected to take place at Friday at the latest, told a GOP leader to CNN.
Hundreds kill by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is increasing
At a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were wiped away from the ground when gigantic waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters high landed at the time it began to plan. Many people plunged and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and became the victim of the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Bureau for Help in Natural Disasters BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree strains, houses, he hit everything on the land,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
On air photos released by the natural disaster relief agency, it is seen that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday the coastal city remained trembling by aftershocking.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the force of the atom bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima during World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, has increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as 'remarkable' and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had crashed.
Some deadly victims were trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were wounded and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala “is completely flat, we have no information at all”, said Nugroho.
Over 300,000 people live," said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,’ said the Red Cross.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a panic building screams to people on the street down to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the coast and is swept with buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large flow breakdown that cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending trucks with auxiliary goods from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacues still need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is reopened only for assistance and is closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Dodentol of tsunami rises above 800.
It's very bad.
Although the employees of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office are looking for shelter in tents of deck, but passing scenes of destruction on the way, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began with the difficult task to launch emergency aid, some complained that some foreign aid providers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financing, goods and staff from abroad may not be allowed until the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says: ‘O.K., this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has not been proclaimed.’
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing were hoping to find their loved ones back, such as in the miracles that people liked to belong to terrible natural disasters as these.
Saturday a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, helpers liberated a woman who had put two days under the ruin with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I am carrying my own emotional tax,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread into the paragliding community and that he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages in the hours afterwards to the sportsmen in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
In his reports, however, only one gray finch appeared instead of two blue pinks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal 26,750 dollars while supplying money car in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning steel thieves 26,750 dollars from a collaborator from Brink who was filling a money car in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver had just emptyed a money car in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, as inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
When he was busy, another man walked from behind Brink's staff and stole a pocket of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects flights, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Those who have information about the identity of the offenders shall be asked to contact the Newport police on the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The being that is formally known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West is already shortly named Ye and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the launch to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the maker of the show.
Ye is not just an abbreviation of his present artist name. Earlier West told us that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'yes', said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album by radiopresentator Big Boy.
‘So I am you, I am us, it's us.
I've gone over from Kanye, which means "the only," to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper that changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced his preference to the names Love and Brother Love this year.
Also, JAY-Z, who used to cooperate with West, has already worked with and without the coupling and capital letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against citizens, the country stands on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody represaille against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired on a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing up to 300 people. During that period, left student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become a member of criminal gangs due to unemployment and a lack of opportunities for studying.
United States must double A.I. financing
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this following the announcements of A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be the number 1 in the field of AI innovations by 2030.
‘Doubling the A.I. budget would already be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.’, said Lee.
A double of funding can lead to a double of the chance that the next major achievement for A.I. takes place in the US, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's main A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, he worked in Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later he was manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organised by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place because it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get public subsidies, said Lee.
"China doesn't pinpoint our best academics, the companies do that," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years acquired the best powers of universities to work on A.I..
Lee said that US efforts in the field of A.I would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Who doctors in the field of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Nature Sciences provides financial support to staff from academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other public organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the American Ministry of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center designed to involve partners from industry and the academic world in the initiative and announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (limited Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in A.I research.
However, the US legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has been in the slop for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change of name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in the name of their country in ‘Republic North Macedonia’, which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been attracting decades and would no longer impede Greece's Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and says that the name of its Northern Neighbour is that the country claims Greek territory. Greece therefore put its veto against the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
In June, the two governments concluded an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change in name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slave majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycot campaign is not sure that the required rise of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the bill has been formulated as follows: ‘Are you in favour of NATO membership and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Contributors of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that originated when the former Yugoslavia dismantled.
“I am voting today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this will lead to a safer life for all of us, said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient Members of Parliament have indicated that they will respect the outcome, which will make it decisive.
In order to change the name would require a second-three majority in Parliament.
The National Election Committee said that there were no reports of irregularities at 13 o'clock.
The rise was only 16% at the moment, compared with 34% during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters came to vote.
‘I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018, during the referendum on the change of name of the country which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
For the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and put chairs for tents placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a backport, said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will provide vital investment for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour of, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum less than the required arrival.
Another survey, carried out by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of these would vote yes.
If the referendum wants to be successful, the rise must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and score
Previous Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short metings with the defense of Brighton in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester. Manchester City won the competition with 2-0.
It seemed like a fleet of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peak was first played in the middle field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, right in the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew to pass a defender and was too fast for some others on the outskirts of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty zone to return the ball to Aguero, who used his judicial shoe to defeat target man Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right hand of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City to the press.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in the playing field of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful stitch pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane kept the ball with him and then sent Sterling to the second stake.
The Sky Blues player typed the ball just before he was too far.
City takes it Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The race takes place in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play with and make the Rockies not easy to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there was not much reason to force a new start.
However, the ever competing Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are any consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the playoff. They are currently standing for one match on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least acquired a wildcard for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to do everything to ensure their first division title.
“While there is nothing more for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this public and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why don't I want to play in that?'
Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but are said to be inclined to set up Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start his 34th, was in the entry field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-handed wardrobe stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organises meeting in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while discussing the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
‘Everything we have already achieved is at stake in November.
One of the most important elections in our lives takes place in five weeks.
This is one of the really great elections, and I do not participate, but I actually take part in it, so I come up everywhere for great candidates, he said.
Trump continued: “We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happen now.
And they are determined to take back power, no matter what they have to do for it, you see the commonness, the horror.
It doesn't matter to them who are hurting, whom they have to push away to get power and control. That is what they want: power and control, but we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to 'resist and impede us'.
"And that's what we've seen over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "boos and common and false and false."
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senates Committee on Justice, which led to a loud cries from the public.
“Do you remember what she replied?
Did you select the document?
Uh, eh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.'
Labour is no longer a wide church.
The party is intolerant for people who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Parliament members who have received that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the censor's motion because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe, Ironically enough, similar issues as those in which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday announced: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
And that was the case during most CC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I was already locally Labour Parliamentary Member.
Sadly, this is not the tone of many meetings today and has forgotten the promise of a "friendly, softer" politics for a long time, if it has ever begun.
It becomes increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had similar political views as I, suddenly expected that I would turn around and take a position that I would otherwise never have agreed to, from topics like national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are skeleton parties on social media calling for the rejection of my candidate for the next elections, exposing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I have more happiness than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionality and determination of those colleagues who have to deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day but are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that some of the skeleton parties appear to be considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that wide church, and with every ‘motion of mistrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes more small spirit.
In the last two years, I have often received the advice to keep me deprived, not simply to proclaim my opinion, and then I would not be “in trouble”.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I became a member of Labour as a schoolchild 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of thatcher's government, which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always called for better public services for those who need it most, both in my role as a congregation council member and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, nor at the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy points and my disputes with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves to a Brexit that will damage families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually I have only one message, which is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are a member of Labour or not: I am proud of serving you and I promise that threats to reject my candidate for the next elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsaved Ayr on the way to the top
Two late trials may have tricked the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr rightly triumphs in this delicious race of the day in the Tennant's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the class, the only unsaved team of the ten.
Finally, they were both their superior defense and their better opportunities that the home team made the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We’ve had it so far difficult during our races and we’ve still been unsaved, so I'm a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: “All honor to Ayr, they have better exploited their opportunities than we do.”
Grant Andersons tried in the 14th minute, finished by Frazier Climo, led to a spring for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the warriors' race), Melrose was able to speak the figures and Jason Baggot succeeded in breaking a try.
Climo made a penalty for an extra advance for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just before the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the spring to five points.
The game was a long time silent for a serious blessure of Ruaridh Knott, which was taken off on a brandy card, and once the match was re-started, Ayr could continue by a try of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion from Climo.
Then Leader Blair Macpherson of Ayr got a yellow card, and Melrose re-calculated with the extra man when no conversion followed on a Bruce Colvine trial at the end of a race with the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he hit Climo without the ball, MacPherson cared behind the excited Ayr-maul for a touch-down on the penalty line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe lifted the box kick of David Armstrong and half-back sent Gregor Henry away for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Acteur Ford Kieran went from Still Game to the horeca. Apparently he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, in which he writes and acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that K 00 is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Krue was looking for a way to participate in the ‘blowing restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': it is country-in-country Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Seas patrol in a marine office occupied in La Paz.
On public buildings, an ocean blue flag waving.
On all the marine bases of the Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout the country surrounding Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country had to abandon after a bloody 19th-century conflict of raw materials on Chile is still alive, just like the desire to re-catch the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its highest point in the last decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which should fall after five years of discussion on 1 October.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, looks forward with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the judgment of the Court of First Instance on large screens, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will plead in the benefit of Bolivia that, after decades of harsh discussions, Chile is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous President of Bolivia, who next year stands for a controversial struggle for re-election, is also at stake with the statement of Monday.
“We are very close to the return to the Pacific,” he sweared at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in the benefit of Bolivia, and even if that was the case, there would be little change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands has no power to grant the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation has perhaps even worsened over the past four years.
"The case around access to the sea is caved by the current Bolivian government," said Zárate.
Morales' war-driven rhetoric has undermined all the good will that Chile might still have undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their conversations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk next.
The two countries haven't had an ambassador in each other's country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the decision of the court has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and a chance to ‘end a total of 139 years of disagreement, with mutual advantages’, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
‘Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The pronunciation is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind us.’
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that state secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to start the devastated nuclear diplomacy again, more than three months after the summit meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is a 'utopia' that the persistent sanctions and the American objection to a declaration to end the Korean war will ever get North Korea on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without that Pyongyang first takes important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would abandon an arsenal that the country is likely to see as his only way to guarantee his security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Mode shows in Paris reveal the latest collection huge head covers, shortly for sale from you nearby
If you want to expand your collection of hats or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, don't look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hats were not to think of Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations to the catwalk.
The remarkable piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, which hooked over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons occupied with precious stones, a magic hat and even an ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks the lips were closed. They seemed more on Hannibal Lecter than on haute couture.
The one creation seemed like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glass, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this dared fashion, you'll be lucky.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The gigantic hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-metre wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very unpractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided for another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach pocket that was almost as large as the model in the bathtub that sucked the bag.
The red-orange raffia bag, set off with raffia francs and finished with a white leather yarn, was the most remarkable piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacques during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the entire community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain most popular and desired subjects within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can not only trust in English when we want to build relationships and a liaison with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can conclude that languages are on top of the ranking list, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools associated with SCIS shows that 72 percent of the students gained a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students obtained German, 69 percent of the students French and 63 percent of the students Spanish as well.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as professional choices as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A study by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that of the obstacles to vacatures, 17% was attributed to a lack of language knowledge, according to employers.
Language skills are thus becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now that vacatures require linguistic knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real benefit with such skill for life in the future.
Directly communicating with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage of competition.
According to a YouGov survey among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to talk. French was the only language that exceeded 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages most important to the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this area.
Schottish independent schools are engaged in providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut by le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Sunday his debut at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for the first match of LeBron James at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the opening competition before the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It still needs to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a twot that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six matches prior to the season.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need any matches before the season to prepare myself," he said.
Period of election rally of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallys
It is the first of five planned rally of Trump in the next week, including stops in places he loves, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he prefers for the job in the Supreme Court has been held, Trump wants to build support for the coming interim elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voted in November.
How late does Trump's rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 p.m.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the livestream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings for the candidate Supreme Board Kavanaugh this week, which were extra loaded now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait for a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this series of rally is to help the republics candidate for the elections in November to get more elan.
President Trump's campaign leadership said that these five rallys the following week are intended to "stimulate volunteers and supporters, while the republics are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Delegates, says Reuters.
‘Control on the Congress is so important for his programme, that the president is travelling to as many states as possible now the busy campaign season starts,’ said a speaker of the Trump campaign that would not be mentioned by name to Reuters.
Tonight's rally in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains behind the peilings.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him an angry in the phenomena,” said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the run to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating sling of chances is a fully invented sports concept, but one of which players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who's getting the best chances right now?
"They first had a six-point advance, and now that's only four more, so we find such a little that happiness is currently on our side," said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage that they stand for four points, while there are 12 more in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not at least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and have scored each three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearful opponent from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical keel sounds he makes when he plays well became more loud as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial well with which competition four became a success when he and Thomas stood behind two points after two matches.
His wells with which she won the race at 15 were followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes that the U.S. team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deeply and only worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable, but delicious European duo has four in four and cannot do anything wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that did not play a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their rumorous audience, they are the players to be defeated Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever who books a European victory when the sun goes down above Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
However, it is premature to mention a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backstand for the Spaniard and the Sweed that they did not get over.
But Sunday there is no one who can help to get your backdrop.
The four balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duoes, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way a strategy can change in an eyepiece.
The European team has so far played the best and has a good advantage in the beginning of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to fight, something that some, especially in the USA, doubt.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a beautiful jump on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and four-somes of Saturday, they stand on the United States with 10-6.
The motivated duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had it difficult, making them have four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, that the troop she would like to lose in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blunding Americans in the four balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but couldn't recover his backdrop.
The team of Jim Furyk has to score eight points during the 12 singles games of Sunday in order to maintain the troop.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who wins four points in the row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname 'Molliwood' after a sensational weekend, are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening games.
After taking Woods and Patrick Reed into the four balls, they were beautifully played together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5 & 4.
Woods, who slipped himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally showed a great move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2 & 1.
However, it did not walk from a lean roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after they had lost the first four holes.
It has only happened twice earlier in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to take a backstand of four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Fureich has enough equality, as they currently have the troop in hands.
But as they have been second for two days, a counterattack seems too high on Sunday.
North Korea says that it will "in no case" unilaterally disarmament without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that the continuing sanctions lead to increasingly confusion in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country could in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” last year, such as stopping nuclear and rocket tests, dismantling the location for nuclear tests and the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We do not, however, see a similar reaction from the US,” he said.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no case disarmament ourselves unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a ‘fascated’ approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as the further steps were taken, it noticed that he did not denuclearization unilateral a priori, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work to the ‘duclearization of the Korean peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is striving for a formal end to the Korea War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to simplify the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US urges 'duclearization first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war', said Ri.
“The perception that penalties can bring us on our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only strengthen our confidence."
Ri did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the American leader did earlier in the week with the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: ‘If the other party in this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.’
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from last year when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the American continent were directed after 'Mr Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'raketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim this year with the United Nations to take his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that there is still much to happen and that the penalties must remain until North Korea deuclears.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘Whether it lasts two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, American Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council Thursday: “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must be continued strongly and certainly until we have achieved the complete, definitive, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has committed unanimous sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to greatly reduce the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea accused him of setting 'governmental demands'.
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket and also a nuclear complex if the United States had to take ‘compliant measures’.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'according measures' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard follow course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing manipulation in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor noted that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist associated with the Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. As far as he knows it is unique in the USA.
He got the idea of starting with the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleep deficiency on learning.
'At the end of my talk, a girl came to me who said, 'Why do I hear this now, in my last year?'
She said no one ever told her how important sleep is, what surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which this year is organised for the first time, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleeping habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was established that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, the students see an image of a sleeping room, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise devices and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is influenced by sleep shortage, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
With the help of a base of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that with this we will not immediately change the conduct of the students.
But we think they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the effects of the choice for cigarettes on their health, added Czeisler.
Studying the culture of fierceness on a night still exists, he says, and by modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep deficiency is an increasing problem.
Ensure adequate sleep, of good quality, must be the student’s ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deficiency ensures that the brain gives them a constant hunger feeling.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course, since last year he had followed a lesson from the professor when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study programme before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, not just an alarm to stand up. They must also be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt you aboutdian rhythm, which may cause you to have trouble falling into sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal brings Gerrard's men down
The Rangers saw their excursions again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during an excursion race since they defeated St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but the team of Gary Holt took care of the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as a manager in 18 matches. His team now stands eight points behind Hearts, which continues to run out at the top of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers did not succeed in scoreing the equalizer.
The Rangers now drop to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have even more problems, since frontier Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently a object was thrown to him by the supporters of the visitor team.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team. They crossed Ayr and went to the half finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same elevental for Livingston, who knew the Hearts to cut off a point last week. He would have been excited about the way his well trained team knew to block the opponents at every move.
The Rangers might have had the most ball possession, but Livingston was more involved.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga gave off the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the target of Allan McGregor in the victor, but the civilian couldn't finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached commander Craig Halkett, but his colleague defender Alan Lithgow shoved against the back stake.
The Rangers managed to take over control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
In any case, Alfredo Morelos found that he was entitled to a penaltyship when he and Steven Lawless were fighting after a quarter, but divorcer Steven Thomson wiped away the request from the Colombian.
The Rangers could only shoot twice at the target in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was former targetman at the Ibrox, could easily stop the headball of Lassana Coulibaly and the tamme shot of Ovie Ejaria.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may or may not be in the prolongation of the general game, no one can deny that they earned it, even though it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers weren't raised against the deep game pattern of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed through the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and Menga chose out, who easily stepped the ball into the goal.
Gerrard made a break with the switch Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate effects when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play a kind of game that Livingston likes to play, with Lithgow and Halkett continue to trap long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its advantage in the final stage of the game, but McGregor stopped well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invaler Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked at the end of the race for a penalty after an experience with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other side again.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the almanak of our ‘Sunday Morning’: 30 September 1882, exactly 136 years ago, for whom can TELLEN... the day the future physicist John Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called Geigerteller.
Since then, the geiger teller has not been thinking out of science, and also became an icon in the pop culture, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the at first sight unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘That is a geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you hear the effect of the atoms issued by the radioactivity in the minerals.'
Evans: ‘It’s really knocking now!’
“Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.

The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a lab
They can then ‘see’ a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and will then be re-injected
A test vaccine produces promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that the immune system teaches to recognize malicious cells saw her egg - stick cancer disappear more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they can 'see' the protein HER2, which often occurs in various types of cancer, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of various types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ova cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and to ‘learn’ these cells to tackle cancer cells has already proved to work in treating a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West is pro-Trump-tirade and carries MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was elected during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an unlinked action in which he praised the American president Donald Trump and said that he became presidential scandal in 2020.
After bringing his third number of the evening, Ghost Town, with his head a pet with the text Make America Great Again, he stabbed a tyre against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“When I talk to a white man, often, he asks: ‘How can you now have sympathy for Trump? He is a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I had been out of America for a long time," he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood-ster Matt Damon broke the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senates Committee on Justice in connection with the supposed assault of which Christine Blasey Ford accused him.
The bandage of West was not sent out, but comic Chris Rock uploaded them to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to strike the dragon with West with his post.
West also complained against the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his pet.
“They have been teasing me backstage.
They said, "Don't get on the stage with that pet."
They've been teasing me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Will you see how apathetic it looks?” He said he would attract them superman cape, “for that means you cannot command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give some love."
From the public at least twice, the castles of SNL were embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard by an attendant: “The whole studio was suddenly quiet.”
West was a guest as a last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier bottle.
We received support from the leader of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who Tweet: “To one of our most courageous spirits: BEDANK THAT YOU DO THE MASSA TROTSEERT.”
But talk show-presentator Karen Hunter twittered that West was just 'common himself, and that's beautiful.'
“But I choose to not reward someone who is damaging my community, supports and sprays (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do what he wants.
We too' added them.
Before the show started, the rapper on Twitter had announced that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, "the being that is formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega-rapper Snoop Dogg also wore the name Snoop Lion and the deceased music legend Prince ever changed his name to a symbol and then to The artist formerly known as Prince.
Announcement of attempt to murder after stitching in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempting murder after a man was put down on Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.

The complaint is expected to appear to the police judge in Belfast on Monday.
The allegation will be examined by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones-ster Kit Harington picks out to toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor pulls out to the stereotype of the machoheld and says that when young boys watch such rolls on the screen, they often think they should be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that "there was something wrong" and asked himself how to deal with the problem of toxic masculine in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, married recently with his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be tackled.
'This is really a very important question for me at the moment, where did it go wrong with our masculinity?' he said.
'What have we learned men when they grew up, so that we are faced with this problem now?'
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculine, because of his very male characters.
He continued: ‘What is born and what is taught?’
What is taught on TV and on the streets that young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions today: how do we change that?
For there is obviously something wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games or Thrones when the series is over next summer, because he is “ready with battlefields and horses”.
From November on, Kit plays in a revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is an overwhelming actor.
The actor recently revealed that he found his meeting with his wife Rose the most beautiful consequence of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so in this way I have kept my future family and my life on it from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits personage Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded with an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslies family in Scotland.
Hiv/aids: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
In the majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was previously not the case.
In the past, Hiv has quickly spread in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who run HIV in this way is now nearly zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Compared with the same period last year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased with 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been criminal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
According to studies, the conservative values of the country estimate 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
The diseases are often transferred by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication since 2003 in the context of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff staff has collected data from Republican senators and extracts to ‘hazardous lies’ and ‘complot theories’
The American Congress member Maxine Waters objects to the accusations that one of her staff workers has placed the personal data of three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democracy of Los Angeles claims that the allegations are distributed by ‘extreme rights’ controversials and websites.
"Lucks, lies and more common lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and private phone number of the American senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday and were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual misconduct to the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate at the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters staff, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My co-worker, whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no case responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
Waters’ declaration has soon been criticized online, including by former press coworker of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds angry," wrote Fleischer.
“You can see from here that she does not have the temperament to be a Congress member.
If someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He doesn't have to rebel.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must stay calm and cry.'
Fleischer appeared to compare the response of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of excessive anger during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Thirty, if it's true," he twittered.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
“We will make the offenders known,” she said, “and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff workers.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are looking traditionally for references to the Brexit, and that seems to apply indeed to this revival of the Johnny English-franchise, the comical action films with a sleepy spy in the main role, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was restored in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Does this airy evenatire become about how bad we do it the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with punching eyes and flexible facial features is at least able to send everything into the hundred, including with his second comeback. From his name you can deduce that he is a common comic character that was designed for bioscopers in countries where one speaks a language different from English.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, a bit clouseau, a loose Mr Bean and a grind of that guy who contributed one note to the Chariots of Fire's theme number during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson ever played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (which everyone has been forgotten) who always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two nice moments.
I loved it how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and put the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson can show well in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and too crazy enough, especially now that the "serious" film sequences such as 007 and Mission Impossible self comedy includes as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humor looks more intended for children than for adults, and the great calamity of Johnny English is less original and focused on me than the jokes without text of the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Britain is in great difficulties.
A cyberhacker infiltrated the supersecret spionn network on the web, making known the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain, to great disruption of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the druppel that makes the bucket of the Prime Minister, a pretentious woman with problems on her head and terribly unpopular as politics. Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this character that reminds of Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her information consultants, she must use a retired spy, since every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who is now working as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but gives unofficial lessons about undercover work. Here's fun jokes in the story, because the spy lessons from English are thinking about School of Rock.
English is quickly released at Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former painful help Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a turbulent and joviale role that lies under Vicki Pepperdines level.
So the Batman and Robin of the catastrophic conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's blood-beautiful fame fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is suffering from the charms of charismatic technology billionaires who claim to be able to solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begins on their odyssee of clever fun: dressed as an obers they burn a magnificent French restaurant, they shouted on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For that last, all registries are drawn up, but as well as turbulent as the scene is, they do something to think of children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just as with Johnny English's other films, I ask myself, can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour denies that the party is considering a plan where British work four days a week but get paid for five days
The Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party would consider a radical plan with British working four days a week but paid for five days.
It is said that the party would want companies to pass on the savings they do as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day holiday.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend but still earn just as much.
According to sources, the idea fits in the party's economic agenda and the plans to make the country's balance oversight towards the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Association of Trade Associations, which finds a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranked source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “A policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place at the same time, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's aim to make the economic balance more profound to the benefit of workers and that also fits within the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the aim is not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a policy of the party and is not considered by the Party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the 'facialless drivers' and the 'profiteurs' in utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, because a Labour Government could apply "shortages" based on observed misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the management boards and to set up inclusive property funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) to give 10% of private sector shares to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the research from the FBI to Kavanaugh can make them change their opinions
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination before the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked to the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI could discover something that could cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open here than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was absolute, determined, unambiguous."
However, Graham's voice seems to be wall firm.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh stands firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one called by her could verify it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival is organized, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up will take place on stars and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn for the Global Citizen Festival in Central Park. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: the end of extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting here.
Concerters who want to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteer work, conduct a world leader e-mails, talk a phone or create another meaningful consciousness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years going to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to persuade people to demand a call for action or is this just a different form of 'kliktivism', giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters, aimed at a large number of different objectives.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to the efforts of world leaders and have made policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that have to change the lives of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and declarations based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid out or brought together by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have been affected by almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the main intentional statements is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of helping children realize their full potential. This group has promised $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national authorities and global citizens like you, we can make a footnote of the social injustice that is malnutrition in history," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government has announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In answer to one of the many questions on the Global Citizens website in which "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
The group replied: "It will be a long and difficult way, in which we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, just like civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements before us, we will eventually be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will take place this year during the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the marine for a "blockade" to impede Russian energy exports - Minister for domestic affairs
Washington may, if necessary, take refuge in the Navy in order to prevent Russian energy from being marketed, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the American Minister for Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the involvement of Russia in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legal government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said, according to the report.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to combat this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the marine, to ensure that the routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for those invited during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profits that acts as the 'stem of the energy consumer' in the USA.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that they did not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels," he said and referred to Russia as a country that knows only a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Government of Trump tries to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country that offers far from the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Government Trump, including President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to withdraw from the 'unfit' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum of Berlin, has made Moscow's ' prisoner'.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only sent for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree with the idea that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Alexander Novak, the Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has triggered a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, called on the US to avoid interfering with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Association of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about it' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from Massachusetts on Saturday said she was thinking seriously about it to participate in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
During a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the elections.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will think seriously about it to make me preferable as president."
Warren exported to President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall and said that he "drives this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump brings into our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and on Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a second on Friday, Warren said "we must naturally wait for an investigation of the FBI before we vote on this."
However, an opinion published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own support believes that it should not be preferable in 2020.
Eighty-fifty percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be preferable, according to an opinion of the Political Research Center of Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty-two percent were in favour of being preferable.
The study showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent before a possible candidate and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former vice-president Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said that he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks of PTSS of Track Palin during a election meeting at Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after taking service in September.
He was arrested and complained after a report of domestic violence Monday night.
"Through what my own son has to experience, what he experiences now that he is back, I understand other families who experience the effects of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return," she told the public who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little different, they come back and get harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all other soldiers have given for the homeland."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of domestic violence and attack on a woman, interfering in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the US which refuses asylum to victims who are fleeing for violence of gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and Washington D.C. have submitted a statement to the Washington Court last Friday to support an asylum seeker who fights this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in Grace versus Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union has made in August has not been announced against federal policy.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" have abused her but that American officials have rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
She's detained in Texas.
The Advocates of the States who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people are asylum applications in the US, as countries with major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014, enabling immigrants without documents fleeing for domestic violence to request asylum.
Karl Racine, the prosecutor-general of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is made in the statement of the Friend-of-the-Council.
Advocates continue to argue that the policy that prevents immigrants from access to the US is damaging the US economy, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'providing the necessary workers'.
In June Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges no longer to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asyl is available to those who escape their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political view," said Sessions in his announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to ease all problems, even if these problems are serious, which affect people every day, around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also became increasingly worse.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she tried to comfort her fevery baby in a evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destructed homes and searched for valuable things they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injury and hospitals are overpopulated, as far as they are not damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had gone up a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of heavy aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was printed against the remains of a wall," told Haris to a correspondent of the Associated Press and added to this when he was with his family in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and to our child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of 'intimitation' with 'propaganda advertisements'
A week after an official Chinese newsletter placed an advertisement of four pages in an American daily, in which the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China were proclaimed, the US ambassador in China accused of the use of the US press to distribute propaganda.
American president Donald Trump last referred to the paid attachment of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the American convention elections of 6 November, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the elections in the US marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put China under pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed ever higher import rates.
China's retaliation rates early in the trade war were specifically designed to meet exporters in states like Iowa, which support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador in China and formerly governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American workers, farmers and companies.
"China", as Branstad wrote in a commentary in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "to double the intimidation by publishing propaganda advertising in our free press."
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses freedom of expression and a free press, a long cherished tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing you will find in vain different voices and you will not see real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese population may have about the difficult economic traject, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newsletters has refused to publish his article," as he did not say what newsletter this was.
By the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republicans alienated female voters from themselves just before the interim elections, warned analysts
Now many major republics around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, warn analysts that they will experience a relapse, especially among women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions on this subject have arisen enormously, and most Republicans have already informed that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he was wondering whether the attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (Republic, Arizona) to vote for a FBI study at the last moment would be sufficient to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women are not forgetting what happened yesterday, they have not forgotten tomorrow and they have not forgotten it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the newspaper from Washington, D.C..
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "November comes to it!" during their demonstration in the hall of the Senate, while the Republicans who chose the Justice Committee to approve Kavanaugh's candidateship despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and the motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height" said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analist, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it may be even further, especially among swift female voters in the outer areas and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who often do not vote even if they do not agree with the President.
Even for the public witness of Ford, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republicans were to press the appointment, there might be a relapse.
"This has become a confused ruin for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote in the committee, or the final vote or Kavanaugh's taking place in court, but it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, makes a group that helps Democrats to be elected clear to the news channel.
However, the Americans are divided on the question of who they believe after the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority resigning to the side of the latter.
A new review by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe the evidence of Ford and that 35 percent believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh certainly or probably lied during his witness while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations of Ford and of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford said last week to the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh attacked her under the influence of drink when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court has shown her his genitals during a festival in the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plants a new Internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the possibility to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joke that 'world domination' is the leading idea behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historical moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
This allows you to store lists of contacts, activities lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends completely on the user who has access to which information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that makes all their business models completely on their heads in one time".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am unbelievably optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and carrier of the Victoria Cross from WO I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a military is 100 years later honored in his birthplace.
Lieutenant-Colonel, the honourable Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sharp shooter, and he never knew that he had been the highest military honor in Britain.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was 'briljant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his bataljon on September 29, 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under fierce fire of field shooting and machine guns".
He later rushed through the fire line and led the line forward before he only ran to a field shoot and turned out three members of the detached.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sharp shooter on October 4, 1918, something more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never touch on it, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a cliff after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "to be very venerated to play a role in the parade" and added that "the braveness of a real hero is shown by the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans kept up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig in place
Imagine, you've stayed awake all night to watch a followed Bellator 206 and you won't see the most important moment.
There were 13 fights, including six in the main section, listed at the San Jose poster note, and this was sent all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., especially when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready for their fighting, viewers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed awake for this fight all night.
A fan described the transition to the child program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to the government's regulations, no content can be displayed after 6:00 a.m. in the morning that is not suitable for children, and therefore we had to switch to the child programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Peppa pig," yess."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said that they are going to adapt their programming to ensure that the viewers in the United Kingdom will be given a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the return competition, we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were a lot of text messages going and back and forth, and believe me, these weren't all kind.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case, it was a public problem.
I can promise that this will not happen second time.
We restrict the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic cleanspringer Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary education, he didn't realize that 'not everyone is like I am'.
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about homosexual rights to 'hope' others.
He also said that parenting had contributed to less value in winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show, has taken a few months free because of disease.
Differently as a duplicate on Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt 'less' during his youth than others because it was 'social not accepted to like both girls and boys'.
He said: "To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was 'one', so he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally came out of his nature.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a striking campaign leader for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt happy he could live openly without any further consequences and that he wanted to give others 'hope'.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he became in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, who he met in 2013, "has totally surprised me."
Daley married the Oscarwinan last year, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much," he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same height and low points.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "all perspective" had been changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a golden medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning golden Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at a age of 40 after having received the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there to sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stomped and he died, I could finally recognize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life. To dive for a home-public during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, that he had strongly attacked on his way to the games and which he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs can be listened to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in form, on bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th race in the Ryder Cup, but he must see his form to find out not to make a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participated for the 12th time in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bank by the team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and exercising on the driving range, in an attempt to find out what it collapses.
Since he was never known for his right drives even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the rudes is roughly violating balls routinely punishing.
And if the job in itself is not awesome enough, Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday comes against the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who is linked to new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who stand behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches start well, Mickelson's match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, even though he could, honestly, hardly differently.
"He fully understood the role he had today gave me a knock on the back, struck his arm around me and said he's ready for it tomorrow," said Fureich.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been recorded in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I had expected more of it, but it's like it is and it's the way we were supposed to act.
He wants to be there, just like all the others."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo record on Sunday for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain imaginable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to get jokes with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to keep him crazy at times last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advance can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advance before the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Danes made its debut in the race in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a front of five points on the Americans, but eventually the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, called here, after he had seen the 2018 lighting win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 jump on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not yet a game.
Everyone will have to take full action tomorrow.
Go to work and execute the plan on the right.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to win this troop, and we must keep focusing on that.
I keep saying it, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people standing on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Enjoyed by the performance of his players on a harsh golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead in this area.
Tomorrow, there's another challenge.
Tomorrow the individual performances will be discussed, and that is another discipline.
It's great to be running out there with a partner as it goes well, but when you stand alone, your capacities as a golfer are only really tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Fureich, expects his players to achieve better individually than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind turning on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Mirakel of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that talk," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 major matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there is a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have voted our line-up on this and send the men on the way in the order that we believe is the best and, you know, we're going to try to buzz something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task to try to lead the counter-offensive and put Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany again postponed
The latest frege of the German Navy should have been in service in 2014, in order to replace the old-aged warships from the Cold War, but it will last at least one year before it is ready, because of defective systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The operation of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregats, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newsletter Die Zeit, quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the marine in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have been plagued by the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that ordered the marine in 2007 shall be used to replace the old-aged fregats of the Bremen class.
As far as we know they have a powerful canon, a series of air defense and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to put up the latest fregats up to two years behind each other, far away from home ports.
The continuing delays, however, meant that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are obsolete by the time they are taken into operation, notes Die Zeit.
The fatal fregat F125 has already taken the heads of newspapers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to operate the vessel and it returned to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after the delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of critical 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it were used in a fighting mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the fregats of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship suffers from a serious overweight, which will reduce performance and reduce the capacities of the marine to perform further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the complete project, including the training of the crew, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a dizzy € 3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest fregats have in their grips become extra important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is diminishing.
Before this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, acknowledged that the marine actually has "a shortage of employable ships".
The official said that the problem has grown over time as a snowball, because old ships were removed from operation but no substitute vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the fregats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were available to be included in the marine.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a estate in the Scottish highlands attempts to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will make new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland follows the ordinary and small dwarf bat, the brown big ear bat and the water bat at Invereve Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed on key locations around the estate to follow the activities of the bats through the season.
Workers at the NTS and volunteers are also going to carry out mobile studies using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the cryes of the bat and what kind of what does.
A map of the habitat and a report are then produced to make such a detailed picture on landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Protection Adviser of the NTS, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pastures and how we can best maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
In Scotland and in the rest of the UK, bat populations have been significantly reduced in the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting sleepplaces and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, such as flycaters and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
Because of their nightly hunting habits, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly investigate, carry out inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue actions.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the estate Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten types of bats of Scotland live.
Landscape Manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal territory for the bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much is not yet known about bats, so the work we do here and at other locations will help us to understand better what they need to be able to flourish."
He stresses the importance of control of bats before maintenance activities are carried out, because the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boys, which may eradicate a full local population.
Fledermuses are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall, to disturb them, or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said: "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and of many of our species we just don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects assault charges while his lawyers are ready to persecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo accusations of assault qualified as 'fact news' and said that people want to promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are about to complain about the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the accusations have been published.
The top of Portugal and Juventus is accused of the assault of an American woman called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, several hours after the allegations were reported, the reports called 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to become famous by calling my name, but that's part of the trade.
I am a happy man, and through and by good," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare a legal case in which they want to persecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called an unacceptable report of suspicions in the field of privacy, according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage for a amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident was reported in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the room of the footballer, where, according to the accusation, he raped her anal, as read in the charge submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo has fallen on his knees after the supposed incident and that he told her that he was a '99 percent' a 'good guy', but he is sometimes abandoned that 'a percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that it was mutually affirmed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extraordinary arrangement because she was "angry for the consequences" and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to make the scheme invalid because it is permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the supposed assault and this summer went to the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' as car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "careful" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car producer said that the impact of delays at the border would cost in the case of a "no-deal Brexit" jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis are made from Toyota, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that when Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stop," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without agreement for the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already told that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The Toyota production line runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, where every 37 minutes parts of suppliers arrive in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there may be an unrest on the limits which, according to industry, can lead to delays and shortages of components.
Toyota cannot store stock for more than one day in the factory in Derbyshire, so the company informed, and therefore production would be stopped in that case.
Clark said that theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'accurately adapted to avoid those border controls'.
"We must have a deal. We want to have the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also to take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must absolutely be able to continue with these very successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working with Burnaston for 24 years, who is a representative of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back again.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy prosecutor-general Rod Rosenstein can be postponed a week, while the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the activities of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump and Russia assistants and potential obstacles to the course of law by the President.
The question whether Trump is going to dismiss the deputy prosecutor-general and thus threatens Mueller's independence has been running the Washington rodle machine for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to set up discussions with Trump and to put off the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors made the round that he was about to submit his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he wanted Rosenstein to 'love not' but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would witness both.
On Friday Trump ordered the FBI to carry out a week's investigation to the accusations against Kavanaugh, making the vote in the entire Senate delayed.
On Sunday Sarah Sanders, Trump's perch on Fox News, appeared.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein she said: "There is no date for this, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarcest of press conferences was not caused by an aversion from the 'focus-driving' TV journalists, although, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is doing more question and answer sessions than any president for him," she said, without giving evidence, "We have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that much, and you've often seen us do that over the past few weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dictators who are visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why, he made an open and at times bizarre appearance for the collected reporters.
Health Minister writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and the wish that they continue to work at the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already declared ready to bear the costs of requesting a fixed status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU continued during the summer, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also launched preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is achieved.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Collega from all over the EU and outside bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Schottland is sure you're home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes a speed surgery after having suffered head injury
The liner of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent a speed surgery yesterday after he had suffered a major injury in the vanderbilt Commodores race lost by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, the main coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident was short for rest.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen directly on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him with for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that no details are yet known about the type/range of injury' and Tennessee State attempts to find out when the injury has occurred.
Butcrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was tampered five times on Saturday before he left the field, making this season a total of 18 times.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher emptys when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher emptys when they buy a house in the UK and the yield is used to help the homeless according to new conservative plans
This action will need to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in emptyness is raised to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher emptys when they buy a house in the UK and the extra yield is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success that attracts young voters with promises to ensure more affordable houses and to tell them on many deservants.
The increase in emptyness is raised to persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional yield being stabbed in a public effort to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current emptys, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for the rental, can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million a year in this way.
It is estimated that 13% of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which drives the prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the housing charger.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spooking cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
This new policy is coming just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had called for a reduction in the emptyness to help young people buy their first house.
He accused large building firms of keeping the prices high by buying land and not using it, and called May to abolish quotas on affordable houses to restore the 'house damage' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to expulsion 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister in restoring the British Dream, that life gets better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market must be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be that it is just as easy for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a house has ever become an too vague dream and the humiliation of life without a roof over the head is already too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is managing Scotland"
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his 'ulterior ambition' to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of resurrecting the club from northeast England, which is currently at third place in League One, at three points of first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership for the previous season.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was selected for the B team and with that the kous was off" Ross told Sportssound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw with my father Scotland playing often in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps attracting me.
However, that possibility would not come until I have been successful in managing a club."
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, before refusing avances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Succes for me are currently measured by 'Can I let this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can't see myself as successful when I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years on his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to win the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a crosspoint" he recalled the time he took over the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that the management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did best well, I earned quite well and knew some reasonable peaks.
But football can be heavy.
There are many things you face every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the field, but management just feels good.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm real, I'm so well in my skin, as I have never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in summer has increased the income of British pubs who have hard to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw turnover rise by 2.7% in July, but the income in restaurants was 4.8% less, show the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Office, who collected the figures, said: "Continuing sunshine and the fact that England participated longer than expected in world championships, meant that July showed a similar pattern as in June when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with that difference that restaurants were now getting even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in the turnover of restaurants in June, only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at the sale of drinks were far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also aimed at selling food members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people were just looking for drinking.
In pubs and bars managed, drinking turnover was 6.6% higher for the month, while food turnover was 3% lower."
Paul Newman van RSM, analysts for the free time and hospitality industry, said: "These results have continued the trend we see since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the outward market.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a turnover of 4.8 percent is particularly painful in view of the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators focusing on food and only the time will learn whether the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary refrigeration."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the public, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyses the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a joint turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a secret account for social media, that they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, a few not over 11 years old, has a secret account for social media, that they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Surveys of 20,000 high school students revealed growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of pupils say they have a 'head account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, a few not over 11 years old, make accounts for social media they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'head account' that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who came to her 13-year-old daughter's secret site by chance discovered a teenager who asked others to 'rapture'.
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools discovered that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half gave up personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'count of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Council of the Scottish Athletics World, as non-executing director at the General Annual Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the sports managers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys much respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its election in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am happy to be able to serve as a vote for the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and help manage sports in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four golden Olympic medals, and who now regularly commented on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only the time will learn if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terrible hard work, but I have been completely restored now, I have learned to walk again and today do my flexibility exercises!
Thank you for all the support statements!"
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers with cows divides online opinions
A company that makes breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an advertisement comparing sowing mothers with cows molking.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called 'the most quietly portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, producer of consumer technology, has released an ironic ad inspired on music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to carbonate mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a shore filled with hooi on a song that contains texts like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything of it' and 'In case you didn't know, these are no uiers, these are my breasts'.
The re-freen then continues with 'Pomping, pumping, pumping, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's'.
However, the advertisement, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has directly ensured an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the 'horror' of the dairy industry is condoned.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be expected and be pleased to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days after the birth" is written in a reaction.
Elvie’s breast pump fits discreetly into a nutrition beha (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else remarked: "This is naturally traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilaric'.
"I think this is a genius idea.
I would buy one if I still breast-feeded.
That pumping gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The advertisement is a bit weird, but I haven't been looking for too much.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following remark: "This is a funny advertisement, targeted on moms who have barbecues (often at the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like being 'couge'.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you can see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreet hidden in their beha's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women of these waves sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly in a nutrition beha, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on waves.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD with Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is so revolutionary that it earned a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between cylinder mothers and milk cows, we wanted to place the barbecue and the related challenges in the lights and at the same time show in a sustained and comprehensible way how the new pump will ensure an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of prisoned migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and the harsh policy introduced by the Trump government makes it more difficult to impose children on sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and fear their own chance of staying in the country by registering for a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should issue their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in a witness to the convention that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have registered themselves as sponsor for unconducted minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons had no preceding penalty.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal strangers.
We are persecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process children faster, officials have introduced new rules, making some of them obliged to appear before the court within one month after the start of the detention, instead of within 60 days, which was the standard, according to the employees at the shelter
Many of them will stand by a video conference before the court, instead of personally, to promote their application of legal status for an immigration right.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the greater the chance of becoming anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or flight attempts, according to the staff at the shelter and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are ignored more often because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria commands the 'occupying power' of the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Muallem also called for the Syrian refugees to return, even as the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Vice-President, said that the foreign troops are illegally under Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that 'this will be handled accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred battle until we freed all the Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "several illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which are mainly involved in training and advising the Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-broken country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are beneficial for their return and he refers to "single Western countries to spread irrational fears" that leaves most refugees.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politify a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there is no reconstruction aid available to Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last important bolster of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political conversations.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned away a major attack from Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that this agreement knows 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including warriors of the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which will be "decided out".
Staffan de Mistura, UN MEP, hopes soon to meet the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for after the war for Syria and eliminate the way for elections.
Moualem made clear what are the conditions of the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said that the panel's work should be restricted to reviewing the articles of the current Constitution and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely by a detention procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic final of a presidency ever'.
At present, however, there are no signs of spectacular tiredness.
Since 2014, the 'prime-time' views at CNN have been more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time' compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible person behind the ABC Drama 'Designed Survivor' a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike all the other on TV, the story lines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's going beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you get in mind that you're sitting for six hours looking at a panel experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who's talking about the jack of Paul Manafort's jacket that cost $15,000 (a clothing piece full of overmity' according to The Washington Post) and who discuss the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
I'll never be able to look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"What he does to give you the idea that it is a reality show is partly that he stops you something new every night" said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role division of Trump show and the daily plot changes (a fight begins with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a episode or you have the idea you're going behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC as he recorded CNN.
He could not take away from the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember that we did all those strange shows, not so long ago, and that the people said "this is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization," Fless told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an influx of money, thanks to a recast of a constituent district that requires two seated national representatives to fight for the same seat.
The recently reclassified district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic National Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must record against another seated national representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which knows much overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January judged that the old districts were unlawfully classified ('gerrymanering') in the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knocking party in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a nipped victory in a well viewed special election for the 18th constituency district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considered to punish El Salvador for support to China and have abandoned this
Diplomates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners put out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to revoke the American Heads of Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the spokeswoman of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $ 140 million of US aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful to the Central American country with great unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials issued a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in attempting to prevent migrants from leaving to the United States.
However, half September, some government top officials informed that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible penalties against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence holds a speech at the conference, which is now planned for half October, as a sign of the importance that the government confers to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three American ambassadors have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages about Washington's penalties.
A spokesman of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomas, who agreed to discuss the internal debate on anonimity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who was also close to the government and who also spoke on anonimity.
Study the History
The next step can be the report by the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counteract of the justice by Trump, for which heavy evidence has now become public.
Mueller will probably also focus on cooperation between Trump and Russia's campaign in a Russia attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes color, Trump must be responsible for that institution, just as he makes himself ready to go back to the voters, and perhaps he must become responsible for a jury in a court.
These are a lot of messes, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, will have to make choices which will determine how long the fight will take.
In 1938 German officers were ready to perform a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The history runs around such bends, and the unforbidden march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently faced with various of these bending points.
What will we do if Trump deputy prosecutor-general Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation, is fired?
Rosenstein is in a difficult position since the time this magazine reported that he had suggested, last year, to take up conversations with the president secretly and that he had speculated about the suitability of the president for his office.
Rosenstein says that The Times's report is not correct.
"How will we react if the new FBI research to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible assaults and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress called Trump for responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I think we won't fail through the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever occupied my ambassador residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me away to stick on candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika was pictured.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans van Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will visit Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a victory on the Austrians, after the impressive equity in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Through a kneesblessure, the civilian Graham Dorrans could not play his first match from the season until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a jump plank to better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good 11-fold," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and the match came out with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but seen throughout the game, an equal game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
The coming Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game because they have also had a good result in their last competition, but if the public is going to be behind us, I'm sure we can press through and get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been heavy, of everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feeling-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can now push through, leave the last season behind us and become successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of their pension
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they want to receive care, few people are discussing this with their relatives.
About half the participants in Nationwide's research said they talked to their wives about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked with their children about this.
"People would like a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your marriagegeno(o)t(e) and the children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't make your wishes well known in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial advisor: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care, including a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenditure, or use the own funds as insurance as long as you have money.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when insurance is required.
Ensuring that you are responsible for healthcare so that you can designate a trusted person who can overlook your medical care and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider a mandate for your financial affairs, too.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on behalf of you and ensure that the invoices are paid if you cannot do this yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies in that case?
Define these details in a written plan, so you have the information at hand.
"It's not only the financial matters that are important, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that plan is coming."
Man several times shot with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, 40 plus, was located in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his breast, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'random act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the number of deaths will continue to rise.
Since the communication means have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala regime, a region north of Palu located closer to the epicenter of the quake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was fourth of its 40th anniversary when the tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regent that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regentship, a administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the Central Celebes province, particularly in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
For the last hundred years, Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected by tsunamis according to the Agency for the fight against disasters of Indonesia.
In 1938 a tsunami demanded more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on north Sumatra on December 26, took care of a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes took place on the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast and demanded nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the Richter scale hit the city of Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale found one of the Mentawai islands, off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded about 300 human lives.
2016: A deep earthquake hit the rainship of Pidie in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by devastating buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes found the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and ensured that thousands of tourists were temporarily struck.
Ancient son of Sarah Palin arrested on charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, was arrested on charge of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and offering opposition during the judgment, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female familiar tried to call the police to report the alleged trespasses, he took off the phone from her.
Palin is held in custody in the house of preservation Mat-Su with a warranty of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, surely' when asked him this, the network reported.
Palin is accused of three infringements of class A, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and to a fine of up to $200.000.
He is also charged for a violation of class B, which is criminal with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is accused of criminal offences.
In December 2017 he was accused of abuse of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the supposed abuse.
This case is now for Alaska's veteran court.
In January 2016 he was accused of an abuse in the domestic atmosphere, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group in 2016, after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSS, that he would have retained his service time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been disabled while expecting the death rate to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, which is located north-east of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, with eight killed, a rare penalty that has not been implemented in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, according to the charge, used a hired truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he reversed pedestrians and cyclists coming on his path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov has 'deliberately' killed the eight victims and 'deliberately' has caused serious physical injury, according to the intentional declaration in which the death penalty is required, which has been submitted in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'great, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitsj Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" states in the intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years ago that in the Southern District of New York there was a case in which the death penalty was required.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to lifelong prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed after being sentenced for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any resentment in the days and months after the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He told the detectives that he felt good about his deed, she the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He did not plead to be guilty of the charge with 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represent Sajpov, said that he was 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a debt confession in exchange for a life-long prison without possibility of liberation will extend only the trauma of these events for all those involved," said Patton.
The defense of Sajpov had earlier asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Conservative Member of Parliament says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize a people's army today during a protest at the Conservative Party Conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the "heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of the own Members of Theresa May proposed to give him the direction of negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants at the march in Birmingham that the UK would've already been out as Mr. Farage Brexit Minister.
But the challenge May has been faced in reconciling the strongly divided ranks is emphasized by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise on the ride while this is attacked by Brexites, Remainers and the EU.
Congressors persisted that she will continue and will try to close a deal with Brussels despite the failures, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw Chequers into the garbage.
He proposed that Farage should be riddled and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he turned out the service, we would be out now," said Bone.
The Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers into the garbage mand."
In clarifying his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone suggested that the public opinion had been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to remain in the EU is totally false."
The conservative Brexite Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the public, the opposition is not voting for, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Let Chequers fall and listen."
In a direct message for May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'heat' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of confidence between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "We don't let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to set the fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the national army of this country that has made us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and closed this march with a meeting of two hours in the city centre.
A small group of activists flocked with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour High House, made jokes about the security problems of a Conservative Party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a full farce.
There's not something like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plant 'going well to think' about candidateship for presidentship
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the elections in November, she will think well about her candidate for presidentship.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic of Massachusetts told her future during a meeting in a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican representative who was co-president of the campaign of Trum in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been the center of speculations that it might be fighting with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
An attendant asked her if she would prefer her presidency.
Warren answers that it becomes time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after shooting Wayde Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the death of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at a ET press conference at 11:00 p.m.
They gave a video free of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of the Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot wound in the head and died from its consequences," told police commander Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and has been known to have been present at the crime site, possessed a gun and Wayde Sims shot.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98-metre junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and started the last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pitches and let Hamilton drive in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton returned to the head after a wheel-on-wheel action that forced the Ferrari rider to release space with opposition on the inside after a double movement in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long leader of the race, because he stayed at his choice of bands and migrated on fast finish so that he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round he went to the pits, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, he was a real gentleman and left me by.
The team has done its best for the places one and two," Hamilton said.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump spared senator Dianne Feinstein during a election meeting on Saturday on the fact that she persisted not to be the source of the selected letter by Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at a election meeting in West-Virginia, the president did not talk directly about the witness given by Ford to the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he told that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, unpleasant and untrue'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that takes place in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and unkind and untruthful," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they then say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
You remember her answer, you picked the document - 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added to this, in a senator's imitation.
In July the letter in which the allegations to Kavanaugh were notified was sent to Feinstein by Ford and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her desk was the leak.
"I didn't keep Dr. Ford's accusations hidden, I didn't pick her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go confidentially and I treated it confidentially as she had asked."
But the president did not believe her denial and he commented at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, that was not a good body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In addition to his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the President suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power, with all the necessary resources.
You see the commonness, the unkindness, they don't give anything to who they hurt, who they should drive about to seize the power and get the control back" would the President have said according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return competition with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals led by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team by side before Dwyer brought the Giants back to charge.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to fix a backdrop on Friday night to then defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three matches.
In the fourth minute at 3:35 Dwyer's opening ball came to a helper from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the help with which Beauvillier doubled the jump, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the proposal for the equalizer of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants entered the first rest with a spring, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team repacked and Bouchard brought them back to the same stand with a power-play-golf at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen take the lead for the first time in the competition, late in the second period. He made sure the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games now, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while ensuring that hundreds of people escape the earthquake from an aircraft
An air traffic leader in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that an airplane with hundreds of people could get on board safely.
More than 800 people have been killed, and many are still missing after a heavy earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks still tempt the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild and weather moving traffic stations of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained to make sure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was at that time ready at the start track, could get safe.
Then he jumped out of the traffic stations, when he thought it was on collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter had reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can rise to the thousand, and the agency for the fight against disasters of the country informed that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"People assume that the number of deaths continue to rise because many bodies were under the ruin and have not yet been reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday, and he said to the army present: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks needed for evacuation are completed.
Are you ready for it?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombok, with more than 550 people alive.
Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one more man is missing, after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that Saturday afternoon one male passenger is missing.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and Detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions relating to more details about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
Local boats helped to save the other passengers and crew members, after the plane had been watered during the landing on the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What caused the crash and what is the exact order of the events is still unclear.
The airline and the American Navy both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and has missed the landing track.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot across the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes told that he himself and some others succeeded in watching the water that came to their means to the emergency exits of the zinc plane.
He also said that the stewardessen were in panic and screamed and that he had a not serious head wound.
The U.S. Navy announced that seafarers who were near at work on a yard also helped with the rescue activities by bringing people to the coast with an inflatable boat before the plane was further sinking in the approximately 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last 20 years 111 people have found death in crashes of airlines registered at the PNG, but that does not relate to Air Niugini.
Analyst sets the time line of the night on which a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisition on Friday in the reopening process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analist of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, gave a few hours of witnessing as a witness expert in information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he used the telephone data of mobile phones to determine the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left her life.
Rowlett told him that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford again.
Sanford was in the witness bank on Saturday and told him he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis spoke the truth when he told him he was at Sanford in his truck during that night, Sanford said he was "logging because my truck was then in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone data indicated that they knew each other only one week.
Rowlett said Tellis knew the text messages, calls and contact data of his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He knew her from his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said that he expects the jury to start the discussions later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hiphoptrio wants to discuss the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol states that hiphop is alienated from its origin with political opinions and the mapping of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in Great Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York child's maid is putting a couple before the judge because of a 'racist' text
A New York child's girl, a couple of the judges, for discriminatory reasons, are deceived, after she received a wrongly sent text in which the mother complained about 'again such a black'.
The couple deny to be a racist and calls the case 'expression'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her horror when she discovered that the new girl Giselle Maurice was a negroid woman when she met her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEE WEAR ZO'N SWARTE," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she would send it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the American newspaper New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt uncomfortable, Mrs. Maurice, when she realized her blunder, explained that her former childhood, who was Afro-American, had done bad work, and that therefore she had expected a Philippine.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home with a cab.
Now Maurice deals with the couple to get a compensation of $350,-- a day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bivakge internally with the family, although without a contract.
"I want them to feel that you just don't do this," said Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple bite from themselves with regard to the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to release Maurice after they, insulted by her, were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, told husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even though it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
About the case comparing 'expression', Plasco said that his wife expected a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
"Are you going to persecute such a guy?
That is not so sympathetic," added the investment banker.
While the case is still running, the public opinion is rapidly involved in capturing the couple on social media, where it is hampered for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a speaking bear, reveals newly raised letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: "It is difficult to get into the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before the first publication.
With what we now know about the enormous success of Paddington, it is very embarrassing."
She told her father who, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, as a cameraman worked at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book 'bitterzoet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she told that her father was secretly proud of the final success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so lively for him, it almost seemed like a child's performance; you are proud while you have done nothing for it yourself.
I think he had about the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for the success."
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her by phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was brought to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected that she wouldn't get it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad's call came to say she'd die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love your treasure so much.
We're soon back together.
I'll be with you again.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly developed and left her body.
She died some time before that, and this process turned out everything further.
I could just stay there, knowing what was happening.
I couldn't regret, scream, or cry, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I really had to keep myself up.'
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was mourning about the death of her daughter, entered the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she had to endure.
"Nobody knew it," she said.
"I sat down with my head and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Silent women post messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two loved women who have been lost by suicide make themselves strong to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys add inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Ms. Davis her son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like how I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in the English county Gloucestershire, tells her son was a promising chef cook with a promising grin.
"He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile illuminated every room."
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of life.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's a chain reaction."
Ms. Davis has made the cards, "to let people know that there are others you can go to and what you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep silent - talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt dreadful or depressed or something," she said.
'A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was entirely on the ground on Christmas - when the children extracted their gifts, he didn't look at them at anything.'
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they should handle it, "It rips the whole family apart.
It breaks us apart.
But we all have to continue and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain while FBI research starts
'I thought that if we could indeed get together what he asks, a research restricted in time and extent, we might be able to create more unity again,' said Mr Flake last Saturday, to whom he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart, in the middle of a firmly anchored patness within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their retention has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections are already in five weeks, on 6 November and, as expected, the Republicans do badly, their efforts to get their husbands chosen in the Supreme Court of Justice in the country are seriously difficult.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the American Senate to lobby for Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush, so that his wife, Ashley, who was the Bush, was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI is ready for the report?
Then there will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 republics and 49 democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, vice-president, to issue the decisive vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh before the Supreme Court.
Number of overlappers in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean overlopers has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, states that last year there were 1.127 survivors compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human traffickers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang didn't respond in public.
The vast majority of the survivors from North Korea are finally offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea and where you can make the crossover easier than in the highly secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the survivors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often dismisses them with violence.
The relations between North and South, which are still formally capable of war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, mainly talking about the stagnated negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting took place after the historical meeting between the President of the USA, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, in which they agreed largely to work to the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in the abolition of US sanctions since then.
"Without faith in the US's action, we also lack confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament," said Mr Ri during a talk for the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
Chairman of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate at the US Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and found him inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help to think that if a woman was acting like this, one would call her 'hysterical',' said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes screamed almost and was especially disturbed when he told about his family and his high school time.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him 'great and coordinated character murder' organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh’s witness proved that he was not suitable to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the democrats.
'I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats', said Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether she would try to set up an impediment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the democrats would receive the majority in the House of Deputies.
'I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth in the Congress, or against the FBI, he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he now serves', said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually shortened D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a democrat that Kavanaugh would vote against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade (law for affordable healthcare), because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh asked questions about the review of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to be standing happy if a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed in the Supreme Court', says Pelosi.
Women should just admit to this.
It's a fair tirade of months and years of furnished anger that passes over, and it can only cry to get it out.
"We're going to cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later to me.
"I don't think that weird, you do?"
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere in charge and who told her that she too was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method, where she began to cry when she became angry. Against the one she spoke to, she said, "You may think I am sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried further.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partially lawful as expression of anger, because weeping is essentially ununderstood.
One of my best kept memories from a former job, in a man - dominated office, is when I had to cry terriblely because I was terribly angry. An older woman, a kill business leader who was a little afraid of everyone, grabbed me into my neck and snatched me into a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they got you on the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidate for presidentship.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was engaged in an extramarital affair on board a boat called "Monkey Business" (informally means that "kattenworm" or "apenzones") and retired from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs Schroeder thought that there was no reason why she would not turn herself into a candidate.
"It wasn't a deliberate decision," she told me 30 years later laughing.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign had already been advanced, she was behind with fund recruitment, so she promised not to participate solemnly if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give a thousand dollars to men, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech to announce that she would not start formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude to the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that it was intimidating.
"They'll have thought that I was given a nerve-winning," Ms. Schroeder recalled how the media responded to her.
"They'll have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
How the US-China trade war can extract favourable to Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were obscuring, and although the fight has not been fought for a long time, a long-term gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be beneficial to Beijing.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, gave the first warning this year by increasing taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (EUR 150 billion) of goods; half of all goods income from China in the USA.
Beijing has taken represailles every time in natura, most recent by raising rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion to US goods.
China has promised to equalize the US every time, and the world's world's second largest economy will probably not blink quickly with the eyes.
In order to bow Washington, requests must be accepted, but public bending for the US is much too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the US, China could support positively in the longer term by reducing mutual dependence on the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing, which could lead one of the two countries to an economic free fall, is actually much more dangerous than spectators before recognised' says Abigail Grace, a research worker of the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specialized in national security issues that focuses on Asia.
Syria 'clear' to return refugees, according to Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war of over seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, declared that the circumstances in his country improve.
"Today, the situation on the spot is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the spot.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still some six million people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at the 'Le Golf National' golf course southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn won the number of 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
The American team's star, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the whole tournament, allowed his long blow from the tea to the water at par 3. hole 16 and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shimmered in all its rounds and became one of the four players ever picked up 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest-class player on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may have played his last race in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a hard year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotioned Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the fake on to his countrymate, John Ram, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The tremendous pride I feel because I've killed Tiger Woods. I've always followed that guy when I grew up," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the largest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played on a high level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. commander, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: "I am proud of these boys, they have been fighting.
We have made Europe a little more difficult this morning this morning.
We offered opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their commander.
You need to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overwhelmed."
Red gloed update: Concentrations decrease in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decline in Red Glow concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay Area (near to the western coast of Florida in the USA).
According to the committee, a fragmentary increase in the Red gloed in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier could indicate a fall in concentrations.
The Red glow extends over an average of 200 km coastline, from northern Pinellas to the southern Lee counties.
There are about 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough County spots, but in less places than last week.
Rode was also seen in Pasco County.
medium-sized concentrations have been reported for the coast of Pinellas County last week, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or before the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
It continues to report on irritation of airways in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
