Gutach: More security for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres away: On Tuesday, the new B 33-foot road rampel was taken in Gutach at the village parking lot - in view of the older town hall.
Two plants so close together: intention or signing?
This question clearly answered Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The Rathausampel was then installed because it secures the school path," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel secures both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle-Bewohner.
The plant officially operated yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, the Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian rise, there had to be another lights for their safety," said Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"Take current measurements on the B 33, about 12 000 vehicles per day, the municipality of Gutach, of which is about ten percent heavy load transport," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another ample is more than necessary: "Security is just going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic views had been carried out, a circular transport was also considered, but because of the narrowness in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area, it was rejected again.
According to Arnold, it was all tested at the location choice of the amplers before: "Towards an extra for us with particularly long wooden trunks of loaded transporters, we have determined whether these vehicles can drive out of the Sulzbachweg to the B 33, without turning around the amplers."
The approximately 15 000 euros of expensive lighting plant itself is the "modernest thing that is currently on the market", said Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that light so powerful that the lights of the car drivers can be well identified, for example, even at the deep sun.
And it is also spare: the older lighting facilities consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting facilities per drive.
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant: this is equipped with two radar sensors.
Press the pedestrian to the ample button, the upper radar sensor testes the traffic position.
If the road is free, immediately green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be terminated for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people are going across the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone is safely across the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver has to think of this as a partner and watch the roadway.
This wasn't the case yesterday: hardly showed the amps for pedestrians green, a high-class vehicle went through - in lightning red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the need for his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the hanging of rough violence and stump sexuality, the tightness and joylessness - have often described the ceremony poet.
The Bücher prize winner is known mainly as a prosa author, theatre texts are rar in his work.
Collage from Prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher combines a collage of prosa texts, which is now seen in the garage X at the Petersplatz.
The theatermaker connects elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, believing his family" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important requisite: a screwd sofa, on which instructions are copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the textile material.
Regisseur Fresacher seems to trust the text little.
The 70-minute performance interprets the presentation with a plenty of regime attacks, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic game forms.
Especially the actresses come with some questionable scenic implementations.
They are tightly touched with their head under water, packed with their evening drip onto the wall.
Included in cellophan or Mieder, they stack on dangerously high sticks through the inscending, either monologize them loudly or completely stunned on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly conveying itself in this effort.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
At the end, the overcrowded performance comes a bit to rest, and Winkler's absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and believe that the solution was found in a small black box that finds place in the armature board of each car.
The devices that record every cycling kilometer and report the information to the authorities are the main point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the Federal States to revise the obsolete system for the financing of US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly developed an intensive debate with colorful alliances.
Libertars have been associated with environmental groups and agree that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometres – and perhaps where they were driven – and then use the information for the calculation of tax decisions.
The Tea Party is upset.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while one cannot agree on a procedure at the convention, several states no longer wait.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system during the next ten years, where drivers pay per wheeled mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we can only use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the driven miles on all California cars in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes, pleads US Americans at the pillar.
But in America no longer gets as much danced as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The State Mineral Oil Tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocent per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare at high prizes to raise the tax only for a cent.
"The gas tax is simply not future," says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport law at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a miles-based payment system.
"This represents the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
bureaucrats call it a miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberals because, for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that barriers and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
Californian planers set up the system in the development of strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored objectives of the state for climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also explained that he sees the most common long-term alternative in it.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also motivated by the idea of allowing drivers to pay after the route down.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Directives on Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who in a 2011 report had asked the Congress to move towards miles-based accounting.
The US Senate approved last year a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the pretext and responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas, representing people who often have to leave many miles in everyday life on the way to work or to the city.
Several states and major cities are not moving on their own foot in this direction.
The most engaged is Oregon, who currently employs 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment of the country.
These drivers will soon pay miles instead of mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois testes it to a limited degree with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 federal states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, car drivers were skeptical when they thought that the government could follow any of their movements.
"Awareness against Big Brother and such things were a major problem," says Alauddin Khan, head of the strategy and results management of the Nevada Transport Ministry.
People didn't want it.
When the test went on, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to convert the drivers into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build up a gigantic, spare technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of federal states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can record the travelled kilometres, but not exactly when and where.
That, as Khan said, would be more reassuring to the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not originally take action to help state taxation of drivers.
Instead, it was their goal to take foot in an ascending market for car insurance companies, where drivers should pay on the basis of the driving miles.
But the devices tested by them are also interesting for road planners because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
"The people are more willing to participate in it if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs made big mistakes.
There are far more cheap and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment to give car riders a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a fee on the basis of the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with fewer ones.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device, with which parking charges can be paid, insurance must be paid only for travelling kilometres and speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can evade staus.
"Autofahrers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to participate," says a planning document in the city.
However, some road planners are wondering whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials explained that the Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off charge or an annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Head of Law and Public Affairs.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Little team sleeps awake
The voluntary firearm dealt with her autumn's main sample despite the lack of personnel with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
In his exercise, commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property spring in Burgberger Street.
There is said to have been a short closure in the sawing.
The resulting fire and smoke development injured two people, but one of them could send an emergency call.
Two respiratory guardians of the Wehr prepared to enter the building after the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead to the free.
The second person had to be worn.
This wasn't so easy, since a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it.
There were additional electrical machinery for wood processing.
The first deletion attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made via a flood hydrant in about 100 metres away.
Three clearance attacks could now be designed.
A hollow ray tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what can be achieved with little personnel available.
In a serious case, support is made by the Kingsfeld daily use group.
The commander showed himself satisfied with the expiry of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
At his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald county, Landtagspresident Guido Wolf was also able to explain in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers came from tomorrow.
In the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he and the managers of the vocational schools, as well as the district gymnasium and the parents' chairman of this important question.
"Education is an important location factor", pointed out Claudia Stehle, director of Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, a successful cooperation has been established in the forest town between the funding centre, the gymnasium and the vocational training centre.
He also praised family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a look at the family phase, but also the phase of the demographic change to care for family care," said Wolf.
In addition, he suggested that more and more employees were caring for the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden of employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Whoever has come to know the advantages of the region during his studies, with its acquired knowledge and skills often receive the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the country's president was convinced.
For only if sufficient training places were offered, the needs of professionals could also be covered.
He believes that the location benefit of the district is its beneficial location in the southwest of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already made to develop public transport on his route from Titisee-New Town to Freiburg.
"Keep hardy and make public transport better," he explained at the address of the local politicians in attendance.
With music experience a entertaining afternoon
For 15 years the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger Seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the older fellow citizens were hosted in the lawn site.
This afternoon will take place in St. Joseph's nursing home.
The home dwellers were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was worst salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father, Karl Kimmich, spoke with common melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone walls as the front demarcation of the old schoolyard standing before the renovation to the church street is to be re-established with the renovation plan of the city of Brunlingen.
In the days before Kilbig, a small corner wall was built in the first work of the renovation of the front schoolyard, to stabilise and static discharge of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with Balustrade.
Alexander Misok from the Bräunling City Building Office, sees the further approach to integrating the National Memorial Office into the plannings and creating a rehabilitation concept for the old wall.
Afterwards, a cost calculation should be made by professionals who will then be placed on the table to the municipal council for the decision and adoption of further action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the next year.
After the rehabilitation, plastering and tree planting of the old schoolyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it must be foreseen in time as a follow-up measure, the healing needy limiting walls from the ground on and placed on new underbuilding.
The historical, one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as no drainage is present, needing renovation and has a bognification forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not at present threatened.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of students to use school court, which has been done by the current fortification work.
Originally, the school court was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school walling, which has even been used for film recordings, will join the National Memorial Office.
If the specifications come from this site, the city of Brunlingen hopes for grants from the monument guards.
The students of Brunling's primary school, who are now being retired in a well-saving old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now turned into the ongoing discussions on the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up holistic training at the music university in Stuttgart," said Özdemir the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classics are currently in the jazz location of Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, who is Favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate at the Bundestagswahl on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Rote Landesregierung.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a reorganization of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, the Jazz and Pop study course will be transferred from the Stuttgart Music High School to Mannheim.
US border: "Super-tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and settled a "Super-tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US inch authorities reported, the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were thus arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel had not yet been used, according to the information.
"These cartels are stupid, if they think they could dig through under the radar," said the general prosecutor of the US District of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a camphouse in San Diego, where the tunnel had been discovered.
To the drug bands, Duffy assured: "If you continue building such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cards.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place about a year.
The rail system was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is located in a building that is 80 metres from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters to the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1,20 metres of height and 90 centimetres of width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine found.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three threaten as a maximum penalty for lifelong exclusion, as officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 at the press conference in San Diego.
But it's the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnel.
This shows the "difficulty" of the drug bands whose traditional routes were cut off, said Bill Sherman of the Drug Dea in San Diego.
They would do everything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the arrests, at least one was Mexican, it was said.
You have to expect up to ten years of imprisonment.
2014 is to be Geisinger Festjahr
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Returning the first curriculum is getting closer.
When the year ends in more than eight weeks, the anniversary year rises.
Geisings and church houses were mentioned 794 for the first time together.
In churches, a document was made in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15th, there should be an official opening for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this event will take place in the place where both of them were mentioned for the first time in church houses.
In the context of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen, as well as in Church Houses.
Church Houses will be the 1250 in July at a weekend of 18 to 20 July.
Recurrent celebration.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
At this weekend there is also the church-house celebration.
City music director Rudolf Barth has written a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On June 21, together with the Black Forest Association's Sunday celebration, on July 12th with fireworks in the Arena and on December 13th, the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This is completed and dedicated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last week of September, 27 and 28 September.
During the Geisinger Stadtjubiläum, a new chronicle is also released.
"But it should be a chronicle not only by geisings themselves, but a printed work about the tasting of today, which is just made up of geisings, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today's Geising celebrating 2014 birthday, in 1974 the space has been carried out with the communes.
The new chronicle will then be presented in the new festival hall in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a customs evening on the occasion of her 60-year-old existence, the Harmonie Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the festival on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10th, the music club Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the spring festival from July 4 to 7.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was manufactured in churches (Hausen), which was then courtplace.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason for this 1250-year-old is to celebrate accordingly, and the municipal reform is also down for 40 years.
Council takes track plants to the visor
Should the crossing "Am Hirschen" be completely rebuilt to increase transport safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
To do so, sigach has to take 220 000 euros.
The German Railway wants to improve the Kinzigtal track in the next year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety of rail crossings - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must participate in the costs with one third, the rest share the train and the covenant.
Schiltach's city champion Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the specialities of the Bah transition "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build an outlet at the height of the tunnel wall west of the railroad.
There may also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, at counter-transport without blocking the glues.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road at a given time in order to ensure a smooth transport flow.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, since some councils doubted the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp made the mood of the critics to the point: "We need to take so much money because of such few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway transition "Hirschen" is used regularly for longwood transportation.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partially transported over this route, because the up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route at the haverles bridge because they couldn't turn to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, Haas argued.
Since Kirchberg- und Schlossbergtunnels should be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway transition "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important significance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to examine the cost of the planned distribution of the road.
Nevertheless, the transformation of the railway transition was majorityly agreed with the measure that the necessary support walls are built in such a way that the city could develop the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" for meeting traffic to approximately 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the transformation of the railway transition at the Gerberei Trautwein could draw a very different problem that concerns access to the strongly rising "rolthouse road".
The management had given the reconstruction plans of the railway by the engineer office Breinlinger, as it had doubts whether the planned connection of the rolling houses would be possible without further delay.
The investigation concluded that it was not excluded that the inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting on.
In turn, the city is responsible for this.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood output and the abbiege worked in the current expansion state, it should not be agreed to the transformation of the railway transition, Haas argued.
Also, at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is considerably lower than the other railway crossings, because there is directly the centre of the stop point to which a good viewing connection exists.
Even trains from the main station should have been braked in this place so far that no collision was dry.
Mostly, the reconstruction of this railway transition was denied the consent as the city of Schiltach had to "baden" the problem with seated vehicles, said the Council, as the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after the completion of the construction work.
The Gremium considers the conversions to the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitation waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were to be selected, five are still in the race.
Far from worlds.
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you look for gravitation waves?
Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or flying after earthlike planets, perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These questions are just the responsible of the European Space Agency for Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are to make research a decisive step forward.
The food for such "L-Missions" is about a billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September the elite of European Space Research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were to be debated, five of them have now come into the narrower choice.
Numerous bodies examine the proposals, crochet the researchers.
In the next days a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions has been selected by the Esa to find answers to the missions of the 2007 Cosmic Vision programme.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact events in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets surrounded by these stars - are still in spoken darkness.
A large infrared lescope in the all could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In 2017, the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched, with which 500 already known planetary systems are examined in our nearer surroundings.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers can visualize earthlike planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
Finally, this question should also be clarified about the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as its particle radiation with the planet system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined in an example.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (that is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is intended to start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this, the Esa provides the first of the three L-Missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start their journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and is supposed to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the ice cream of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The World All offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also differences that might point to physicians to a new theory, among which all known natural laws can be united.
How did the universe originate and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Urknall.
In addition to our common matter, the stars, planets and living creatures as we exist, there is dark matter, whose gravity has galaxies and galaxy hops, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the world is accelerated.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the Urknall, nor what dark matter and dark energy exist.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved a M-Mission here, whose launch is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, allowing conclusions on the nature of darker matter and darker energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chances of a permission as a L-Mission are, in the opinion of many experts, "E-Lisa", a demanding concept for the detection of gravitation waves.
This includes changes in the structure of space, which Albert Einstein had foretold almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven until today.
Elisa could do that, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in the All.
In contrast to plants on the earth, he could also prove gravity waves that originated at the Urknall and thus provide new insights about the origin of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are still competing for the second L-Mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is intended to detect and examine earthlike planets.
Among other things, there are already proposals for the shipment of the mars, for exploring the moon, Venus and asteroids, asteroids, as well as for sun physics.
Snowden willing to ‘cooperate’ with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. secret service, said that he was willing to travel to Berlin and speak before the German Bundestag when the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander do not answer their activities.
The German member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where this asylum has received to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, this writes: “Although the result of my efforts proved to be positive, my government continues to treat a deviating opinion as a disloyal breakdown and attempts to criminalize political expression with threats of criminality, where no defense is possible.”
But to say the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government of dropping the charge against him.
The charge raised by the U.S. Ministry of Justice includes spionage and theft of state property.
German interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to speak to German representatives, we will find ways to make it possible."
The relationships between the USA and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has absent the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the honourable Member who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to snowdresses as a witness if possible, “without threatening them and totally ruining relations with the US”.
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published an image of himself and snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists on his visit to Russia.
Ströbele said that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee, Snowden could not return to Russia when he left the country.
If Snowden said in Germany, he would need an assurance that he was "sure" there, said the honourable Member.
In his letter, Snowden explains that he was exposed to a “fancy and continuous” persecution campaign that had displaced him from his homeland.
However, it was touched by the global response to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the uncovering of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a prerequisite to the public.
In his letter, Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation, “if the difficulties have been solved around the humanitarian situation.”
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to stew hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade, even if in the announcement on Wednesday it was to read that passengers should keep the whole dose.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in baggage box above the seat, small bags below the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars were calculated when the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who paid at the airport.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of 100 US dollars aims to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she said.
In 2008, airlines began demanding fees for the first and second baggage paid.
Passengers who tried to handle them have therefore stacked as much as possible into the luggage as possible, resulting in that the luggage containers are often overfilled over the seat.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less with them on board.
O'Malley said the new fee doesn't really mean to earn money.
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier who have clearly expressed that it is increasingly difficult to find space in the section above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at frontier’s airport may be allowed to take a baggage free of charge, but the next person has to pay $100 for a comparable baggage.
O'Malley explained that the frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed about the fee before they would be to the airport.
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will only enter into force in summer, a exact date is not yet available.
Passengers often shrink over luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to rely on them.
They argue that transportation of baggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wished it.
Many at Wall Street consider the new luggage fee as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flight travel after years of loss.
However, most have so far left the fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first fee for hand luggage, and later allgiant Air, also a cheap flighter.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully observes the additional fees.
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that hand baggage fee would bring Spirit 50 million US dollars annually.
Sorensen, who previously had a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flew with spirit and was curious what would expect him at the flight stage if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand luggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth knirls and handy discussions on the highway.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like messed."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought limonades or juice should keep the whole box and be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had tried to demand money for refreshment drinks, but it reverted seven months later after passengers had complained and no other big company had been relocated.
Frontiers step to raise fees for the luggage, if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative with which customers should be tied to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per sold ticket.
This gives all societies an incentive to move passengers to direct purchase with them instead of via an online travel agency.
However, frontier has gone most widely in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flight miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route.
A flight with frontier booked at a third-party provider will therefore only bring about 250 miles by customers.
Passengers can also reserve places exclusively when buying directly on the frontier website.
Frontier has a faithful customer root at his seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The revenue decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity decreased nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the Mother Group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to control frontier finances in the context of the company's sale.
Sayings come from the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last female breakfast this year in the evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipal house were "Springs from the Bible" and "Returns from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, received the Bible proverbs after breakfast.
"Spraches contain life courses, regulations or warnings," she said.
It compared several words with the corresponding scriptures and explained the significance.
She called words of words like: Be watchful, as shoes fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone, the Lord gives it in sleep, and wash his hands in innocence.
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners what the word was.
The medieval speeches took place by the church congregation Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue making, cut off.
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches that she called "bridges into the past".
In the end, a tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors in the breakfast round, mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger was also mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot Project for Unemployed in Tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is launched at the Mecklenburg lake plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unemployed in the industry are expected to be qualified for professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with closures," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Working Agency.
The benefits are a variety of: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would be trained professionals who were increasingly missing in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency should not finance unemployment.
The project also involves the industrial and commercial chamber in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that an internal error and not hacker are debt to the crash of the website
The shadeful National Security Agency explained on late Friday that a mistake caused its public website for several hours and not hackers, as it was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the Spionage Agency in an e-mail-sentified message.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure had been caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evenings, online server tractors noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that for some users it is not possible.
A spokesman of the NSA had previously explained to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the authority was “in no way compromised.”
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have lahmed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
For such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website is collapsed.
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate into the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (No such authority), is now found in the light of the public and is seen after the unveiling of its extensive monitoring programme in the country and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data that were stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA co-worker Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service fired initial speculations that the incident today is the result of targeted cyper surgery.
The number of people without a job in October is slightly dropped at 22 to 1.307.
Although the rate of 3.1 percent is better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped more," says Monika Feld-Bauer, Deputy Head of Business Office of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have so far responded to settings.
One reason for this is according to field building: "We have little professionals in the crafts, health care and old care."
Since September, annual times have also been running job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry.
In mid-December, the winter season starts there.
The entire background report will be found in the Allgäuer advertisement sheet of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Expenditure of profits at bombardier after decline in delivery numbers and orders
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, after having been under pressure by decreasing orders and deliveries in aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in rail savings.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also published no flight test data for his brand new CSeries plane and did not give any new information about whether the plane could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule in September next.
Only three further starts have been followed at the tire flight of the test aircraft until now, which makes it appear questionable if the test phase runs as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a course of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, Analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his evaluation of "outperform" to "perform sector" in order to ensure that the share has a limited rate potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Whilst weaker supply numbers were widely expected in aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the plane goes ahead.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time after months of delay in September.
However, mandatory orders for CSeries with 177 moderate, since potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the company's claims on fuel efficiency and the cost saving potential of the new Düsen Aircraft are applicable.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President Pierre Beaudoin is confident that bombardier will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The management of the company also insured on Thursday to analysts and media, the program was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the standing time of the plane, ground testing and software updates were established.
Every manufacturer is planning differently.
We have decided to make a first flight and then hang on a revision period, whatever we did.
This happens throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it was said by the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether twelve months after the first customer's youth flight can operate a CSeries plane.
Bombardier explained that it examines the planning of commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the next months.
“The slow advance of the flight test – even though they obviously correspond to internal planning – strengthens our view that the operation is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardiers dropped net profit to 147 million dollars and 8 cents per share of $172 million and 9 cents per share a year before.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
The turnover decreased slightly and decreased from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a drop of 57 last year.
The net collections fell from 83 planes to 26.
The order stock in air and space savings amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on September 30th and was therefore unchanged as compared to December 31th.
"In the area of aviation and space, the results were disappointing under our requirements, but the low intake of order and market conditions as a whole," said Beaudoin.
The turnover in air and space savings fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector increased by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order stock in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on September 30th and was slightly increased compared to December 31st.
The profit margin in the field of transport has been affected by dismantling problems in some major contracts.
According to corporate management, there will be new rules for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the bombardier share declined by 8.5 percent and was 4.83 Canadian dollars after also announced that the Google Financial Board will switch to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardiers closest rival worldwide, reported a drop of ten percent in quarter profit on Thursday.
United States: Shooting at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport management on the short news service Twitter informed that the protector was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security man has also been killed.
Media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is constantly informed about the situation, said the speaker of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses indicated that they saw a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told the broadcaster CNN that many people would have been looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have shouted and wept children.
Under the waiting people, panic was broken out, many would have hid behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
A security agency of the TSA has suffered a shot injury on the foot.
The scene was "as in a movie."
After that he had been taken to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen close to a safety control area.
Airport buildings evacuated
On television pictures, there was a number of healthcars and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were brought to safety from the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special use command and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport guide told via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were locked, which, according to CNN, formed long backstairs.
Until landing, air traffic had been temporarily stopped, it said.
However, on CNN several flyers were also watched at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly used by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is a major airport in the USA.
Cocaine dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must be imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information on sub-world size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpooler Crown Court
A well-known criminal defendant who warned a drug baron from a large police investigation because he feared that his secret drug addiction could be revealed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided sub-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations of its activities in the drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The first-class attorney with the nickname “Bash” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had supervised Scarborough, which he had represented in an earlier drug procedure.
Officials observed Scarborough (32) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal of the lawyer chamber.
The investigations showed that thista regularly consumed drugs of class A after traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards during tests.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by the police in the context of a large investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were arrested later after the police secured a number of house searches of heroin and cocaine at a value of 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could be published.
Today, thista, who works for the Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found and sentenced to the Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week procedure in two charges for the disability of justice.
He admitted the cocaine ownership at an earlier survey.
The attorney was transferred after the police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that in February 2011 he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta.
Two investigative officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and there put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the garbage tones of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly called with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers's soccer stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was known that thista was a “regular consumer” of cocaine, after the tests were discovered in class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Thista was later arrested, but he refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the suspicious dealer because he was his client, and claimed that their discussion was subject to the ‘annual secret.’
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
In the police hearing, he stated that he operates a office and clients both under his private address and at the workplace would call him at home for legal matters.
In court he became aware that he had called on important drug trafficking stakeholders, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed what the mediators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “A criminal attorney should know better than all others that the law is not broken.”
Thista is accused of the abuse of his position as a criminal defender, as he has left himself too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who cares for his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these persons.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He responded to police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta therefore called for his professional status.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Itta pointed out every misbehavior, saying: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I wasn't, and I wanted to pass information on to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours but do that immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead said of the police in Lancashire: “Herr Ditta has done the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and emphasized him for the motives of leading members of organised crime, which commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Thista has defeated this confidence and tries to go behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a condemnation in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning of criminals and shows that no one can withdraw from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Thirty-five others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published a field with questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as lawyer clients in the U.S. death cell, his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and the inequality of opportunities is the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To conclude the celebrations from the occasion of his 160-year-old existence, the song ceremony Dunningen is surrounded by two services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which the spectators enthusiasmed in spring this year, the song crown will enrich two services with the performance of the German exhibition by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 at the evening fair in St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 p.m. in the church of St. Johannes Baptist in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Messe with the original title "Songs to the celebration of the sacred sacrifice of the fair", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of the birth.
The fair is listed in the context of the services, as the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the Brass Group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis softens the confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, Haslach (SE) will change its basics in the seal care unit.
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because there is nothing to change in the fundamental decisions of the diocese, and it is at the parish councils to implement them as satisfactory as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the skepticism toward the New one softly hesitant but watching confidence.
From the ideas and expectations to the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seelsorgeteam were sufficient.
Regional decan Georg Schmitt explained, on the basis of a presentation, the revised directives on organ care units in the Erzdiözese Freiburg.
Afterwards, the SE Haslach as a church community will form an agency of public law, which enters into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities so far.
There will be only one common parish council and a foundation council in which the priest's power is represented.
At least two selected members are supposed to be represented from each parish, in the six parishes are formed locally so-called municipal teams.
Their task will be to promote church life in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parish community then showed considerable need to talk.
The innovations provide that accumulated assets are retained in the parishes.
On the other hand, liabilities go over to the general community.
There were great concerns, especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment would be to all the parishes.
"Even in the past, only projects were invested that could be handled by the individual parishes alone," relativeed Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the Board in the Seel care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they had taken the task "One one will, stay five" and had to find that this is not so easy at all.
The institutions of the Haslacher Seelcare Unit were then involved in answering questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council as well as the practical work of the municipal teams.
The preparations will be conceived at further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the next spring.
At the end, parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the seed care unit, which was agreed with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to meet higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of the City Works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, a four-headed Pfullendorf family has reached 70 to 90 euros per year.
The essential reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase of the so-called EEC surplus from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This change is redefined each year in October by the four operators of the large electricity roads.
These amount to the additional costs resulting from the energy turn which they can charge through a change above the electricity price.
The townworks Pfullendorf form the last member in this chain.
In his forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher turnover, as Jörg-Arne Bias reported.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're going from an increase of 1 cent plus x", says Bias, where the number will be near the 2 cents.
Temple on durable red: pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a ample just doesn't get green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
Then what are you supposed to do - if you drive red?
If a person was waiting for a red ample long enough and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "adjusted", which could be differently interpreted from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before the functionality of the lamps is assumed.
However, whoever continues the journey despite red light, must be clear that he is fully blamed for an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warn Becker and point to a decision of Hamm's Oberlandesgericht.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the amps after about three minutes and had to be responsible for a negligent red light violation.
The ample was not defective, but was little later exploded on green.
A prohibition of driving was left to him because of the special situation - but not the penalty.
The municipal council is delighted with solid households
Whenever it comes to the household in municipal council meetings, mayor Ralph Gerster has been laughing well.
The municipal sackl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not been aware of the administration since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be booked as full success in this sense.
This was evident in the performance of the accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of approximately EUR 7.6 million was more than EUR 1 million than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
The surplus is due, above all, to higher commercial tax revenues and to the municipality's share in income tax.
The assets budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher increase in the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
As less investments have been made in the financial year 2012 than planned, savings have also been increased.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked him for the good work at Rothmund and her team.
"You don't simply shake such a work out of the sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the municipal councils were clearly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxally, but these good figures could soon be expensive for the citizens.
Through the good financial situation, the municipality was able to abandon high lifts in the past.
However, according to Gerster, the country’s grants had already been reduced several times.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensatory sticks.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must provide certain lifts.
"We need to look at the issue of lifts, as investments we would like to have grants in the coming years," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in choir for 60 years
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermter's history is almost twice as long as that of the herbs festival in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his men's singing association.
Even after 60 years, singing with the now probably more than loved choir still makes him great fun.
In the association, Wermter was also active, including 28 years as a member of the Committee.
He received several awards for his engagement and his commitment: Jörg Koor, Pastoral representative on behalf of the Cäcilien Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him - as the choir is also a church chor - a certificate of the Association and a letter of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singers gave him the document of the German choir association as well as a graved tin platelet.
In addition to the honor, the 31th autumn festival was in habitual trains: with the MGV Betra, the singer crown salt strings, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the full marchers had loaded a colorful mix of various chores and vocal styles, which were the about 400 visitors.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with voiced songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Luxurious, her brothers".
Their honorary singer Hubert Wermter made them a little bit of honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men singing club Betra also sang classic choir songs like "Jachterweren" by Julius Wengert, "Weet, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann you pass through the valley".
With its mixed choir and group of women - the "Impulschor" -, the song crown of salt strings provided the female rate of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped with the nepolitan folk "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" of Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also relied on foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to the homeland with "What isch of Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the full maringer musical club offered the crowning musical finish.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer introduced a casperl theatre and read a few stories that the children spent the afternoon well.
Children's dreams become true
The children's gardens and children's day places in the Customernal group are posted in these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Black Forest Bote wishes to support the facilities in implementing their construction and enchanting wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
Participating in the action can all children's gardens, children's homes and children's crabs from the entire customs native.
If you have a construction or beauty wish for your facility, you can apply with this to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all mails.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be realised with construction material in the value of up to EUR 2000 and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner itself has to provide for many hard building workers.
What about the Day of Action and the Helpers?
With the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb, Bauhaus provides the material.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the teachers and children themselves.
Kenyan Press displeased by controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and we can ask ourselves: 'What does Parliament refrain from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?' was the newspaper who considers the draft law as unconstitutional.
“The law is draconic and very punishing, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites of Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be prejudiced because it is an extended arm of the government” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, through the new law, “the media effectively take into a guise,” The Standard writes, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya, having suffered a “serious stroke” and called the draft as “draconic”.
The adoption of the law is one of a number of measures to strengthen national security in the course of the attacks by armed Islamists on the West Gate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media took the rage of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which the units sent to the crime site supposedly robbed the luxurious shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to the submission of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the preload was revoked after a cries of the media.
According to the new law, media houses with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan Schillingen and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on the "living blogosphere" of Kenya.
If they don't take the media to silence, politicians could do unpunished whatever they want.
"No one will ever experience it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at the nation who calls the Kenyan media a crucial control factor in public life.
"We leave politicians themselves, lead the country to bankruptcy and return us to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
In the past, the Kenyan legislatures have already drawn up the public anger.
In May, they agreed to reverse the reductions ordered by the National Repayment Commission and put their defty salaries of about 532,000 Schilling back into force per month – they are among the highest worldwide.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
In the significance of the city and the football club, the official inauguration celebration for the art grass sports site despite the cold weather and the rain did not take effect.
A more pleasant celebration day last Saturday probably had everyone wanted, but Peter did not want to play with it.
Thus, all those who came without a parachute or could not keep such a thing for some reason.
This went to the musicians who framed the festival act, as did some speakers.
Nass was therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks was given to all former mayor Walter Klumpp, who was committed to the implementation of the project, to the municipal council, the participating companies and association members.
Here, especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The equipped pensioners placed 400 square meters of patch stones for the new paths.
This remarkable honorary commitment was also recognized by the Landtagsabgeordnete Karl Rombach.
Further greetings spoke for the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South-Badish football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp reminded that repeated weather-related influences in the spring and autumn were in such a way that it could not be played.
There were the first considerations to solve the problem 15 years ago, when it was thought to build a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the Real School at Salinensee.
Both of them were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts about the establishment of an art race sports lot appeared, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were included two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, allocated a cost participant of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of EUR 560 000, summarizing Klumpp.
The construction start of the 68-108-metre art grass square took place on June 4th.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic meters of earth were carried off, half of which was used for the construction of a Dirt bike line.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with internal and judicial issues.
The responsible working group was gathered in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is direct democracy, deputy confiscation and the federal police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Group also wanted to continue their discussions.
This should include the subject of double citizenship, where both sides have contradictory ideas.
The SPD wants to end the force for immigrant children born in Germany to decide for one - the Union refuses a double passport.
In the field of traffic, which is not at the meeting regulation this Friday, the SPD undermined her no to a car wall required by the CSU.
A Vignette is a "fleet for the variety and thus ecologically contraproductive," said the SPD negotiator for the issue of traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
It threatened retirement traffic on roads, which are already a major issue of accident.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be only a first step from the perspective of Pronolds.
"There is the danger that the compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later time," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing fountain wave on the open-light bush
Stuttgart - "When's going to be the right summer?" wasn't the question on Friday evening at the Freilichtbühne Killesberg.

Vienna Airport collects passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In the future there will no longer be an indication of how this will happen at the Vienna-Schwechat airport.
A large part of the speaker's statements fall away - the noise level is to be reduced so clearly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of passages affecting individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already abandoning calls.
Due to the failure of these passages - on average, about 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - it is intended to be more quiet at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual passages have been relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about altered flights or departure times fall a little," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games on the Cold Court
In addition to brake car riding with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Cold Court from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander-Games start at 13.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swashed on the Cold Court.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of tree trunks, hip yarns and water eims.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It's not on the far way," explains Organizer Peter Saile.
The strain must be thrown vertically, overlap and then just get to the bed.
This is assessed with most points.
The target accuracy is in the pinch.
From eight meters away, it will be thrown to a punch.
The skill and strength of the participants must prove to be more than 50 meters in the water circulation.
Time and water in a bottich are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two may participate in the single competition.
The winners of the team and single competition receive prices.
It can be trained from 10 a.m.
Delighted is a suitable clothing, for example, the fighters can arrive in the scotch skirt.
But also swabian cargo is allowed.
For "Outfit" the jury gives a few bonus points.
You can log in up to an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander-Games and the Tractor-Pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has been announced at the festival on Saturday.
In the evening, the bubble music friends come at their expense.
At 7:00 p.m., the birabhmic bubble music from Schömberg creates the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fleet Polkas and march.
However, their repertoires include sensible rollers and a satisfactory big band sound.
Heinz's cook will be known as a singing host and black root baron from whiles under the runs.
In Dornhan, he has already occurred at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzunft.
On Sunday, the musical club will enter the early stages, the farmer's chapel Böffingen is a guest from 14 o'clock, and the "Oldies" will then make the festival sound.
The stopelacker party is already open on Friday with DJ Ralf.
Other program points include the Oldtimer and Schlepper Meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the field of agriculture and forestry.
More attractions on Sunday are the maize labyrinth, the craftsman market and the sheep shaving.

The promotional club, the ski club and the tractor friends are organized.
Overview of milk and egg alternates
Vegane diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Poured tofu with plant sand is, for example, a quarter set.
Others call the Vegetarian Association the World vegan day on November 1st.
The Vegetarian Association of Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World vegan day on November 1st:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, allow yoghurt to be replaced by Sojajoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, hafer, amandel or rice milk can be used.
Vegetable snake of plants replace conventional snake.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, half a crushed, mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a dining spoon mealed linen seeds plus three dining spoons of water are suitable for this purpose.
Locker becomes tides instead of eggs, for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a dining spoon of food strength and three dining spoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of sojajoghurt or silentofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, some 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany, i.e. purely planted.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest College met the American Great Town of New York.
After eight hours of flight it went to Brooklyn Bridge, where the heart of Manhattan was reached on foot.
There was already a fascinating view of the world-known skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on the legs, but faithfully to the motto "The city doesn't sleep" the day on Times Square was decided.
Despite shutdown, on the second day, the stand of freedom could be reached with a ferry and climbed on foot.
Afterwards, it went across the financial centre around Wall Street to the Memorial of September 11th.
On the third day, the students from the 373 meters high-level view platform of the Empire State buildings could gain an overview of the fascinating city and enjoy the view.
Afterwards it went through the hectic breeze of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience school every day at Weymouth High School.
This year too, on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marie on the Hülsbergstraße, a Hubertus fair is celebrated.
St. Hubertus was the Sage for a fairly reluctant hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed the Bishop of Lüttich.
The hunting horn blossom group of the hunting riders of Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Klut musicates on perforce horns (natural horns in the mood of Es) after old, originally French melodies.
The blowers wear riding clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog emeutes on slip hunting musically.
The festive fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 p.m.
The newly designed surgery shines with a new cafe.
One that invites to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to Lexicon, Déjà Vu is called a psychological phenomenon, which feels like having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of visiting the same name café at the battle in the district town of Kleve in sight of the University of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to stay at the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that for the purpose: to make a real stay not only thoughtful, but to make hand-resistant again and again experienceable.
Because it's just fun and just nice.
A look into the interior life at the optic 8 gives the viewer at the moment a good feeling.
The highly modern but not cool cafe ambiente looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner spoil the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
For this, there are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name before the opening of the tasty café on the scene as a gastronomy: In Kranenburg, they led the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the plot, the sympathetic Café lovers are expecting more audience.
Not least also through the university.
"What we have no specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Instead, the two of them want to address young students here as well as seniors and all age classes between them.
Propose Café-Liebhaber.
The sympathic holder is behind the coffee genus.
Enjoys the fragrance of hot herbs in the most diverse variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino Trinker.
"That's a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events were already in the bright cafe.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival took place rather outside - the café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringling night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not a pronounced fan of event events: "You can't do all right now."
And with an event I always talk to only those who are interested in the special event as well.
Therefore, events will rather be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the whole normal operation as little as possible."
Should say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful environment at the pitch in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a gastronomymeile.
For the delight of many clergymen, the guests from close and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks to the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the association site of the "Witteborg" guesthouse in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious collaboration throughout the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate festival to make honors.
The special award "Songers of the Year" was pleased this time by writer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written up a lot for us, but have also turned some rounds for us, our warm thanks for it," said the Chairman of Chores Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir samples through activity bouquets this year went to the chore director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by Honor Chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the Chairman himself, and the last year's singer Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Place of five scores, Artur Brückner.
A particularly thankful board addressed the team of club wizard Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once more had adorned a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" always meets his regular choir samples at 19.45 a.m. at the club's place.
"New singing joyful voices are welcome to us at any time," says Schlotmann.
UN proclaims new targets in combating poverty
The United Nations starts immediately with the preparation of a number of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago for the fight against poverty.
In front of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which started in Rio de Janeiro on the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the preamble for "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Goals in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the evening at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests”.
"I am delighted that the Member States have agreed to initiate a process agreed with universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
“These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I will not take any effort to implement this mandate given by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium objectives."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball oberligist continues to have a good mood.
That's why Trainer Tomasz Malmon doesn't make any doubts at all.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
Still, I hope we will finally win again.
"When I don't know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-liga reservation from Fredenbeck has not yet scraped out trees, Malmon in advance warns the point finger.
Many players I have trained myself in the A-Youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it should be waited if there is still reinforcement from the first one," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must, in any case, increase in terms of the past performances.
Before all things in the covering work and in the switching game, it last had a great deal.
Also, the use of opportunities must definitely be improved.
That's why I hope my players finally got their head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in view of conflicts between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique, to vote for a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an Investment Company.
Because of the fear of the future of the country, it has exchanged its business clothing against a T-shirt with the inscription 'We require security' in Portuguese and joined itself on Thursday at the capital's independence area.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports on conflicts between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fights since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo once was a rebellious movement, which was initially supported by the White Government of Rhodesia and later the South African apartheid government, in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country is falling back into an adult conflict, but recent events have disturbed foreign investors and locals.
For the rapidly growing economy, the discovery of huge gases in front of the coast and coal warehouses in the northwest could bring investments of more than 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the coming years.
The governing Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent collisions by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Hochburg Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government teams attacked Renamo support points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, declared spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the conflicts and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to reduce concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself to be a loser who “will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He said against the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respect the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of the tensions fired by a number of contradictions this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who are collapsing the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Muslim experts.
None of them are good in negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary consents.
Renamo, who is pressing for election reforms, has already explained that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to inflict movement, to create concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electoral success has shrinked since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM) founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza wants to destroy the country's democracy – its resignation when its second term ends next year.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidential office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear about the capacity of Renamo, but it has taken trouble on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied reluctantly to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, the slowing progress in the development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"The people think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted stability.
"Nobody is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useable streets again," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “the examples of life,” says a author.
The stories of Thor showed that “brutal force has no chance against clever tricks” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are “very too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools," why Crossley-Holland called for an “considerable selection” of ancient works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklores are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who were "overly didactic", children would be "deactivated completely", because in entertaining stories, the messages would be "suffering".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Angel Saxon, who is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as possible.”
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and a author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the Happy End, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be depicted underestimate, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved his retirement seat in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the very short-term scenery game.
From the arrival to the borrowing of honorary citizenship to his death, film author and Hansjakobdarsteller Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an enthusiastic piece that received a lot of adventure under the regime of Cornelia people.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesman through the ten different scenes, explained cohesions and overwhelming time prizes from the youth to the nearing retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, in his courtyard.
And then the scene game, in which Alois Krafczyk shined once more in his parade role as the great son of the city.
In a stylish way, he presented the two-speakers and "Black Forests Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause, and his sister Philippine also called him welcome.
Billy Sum-Hermann understands it incredibly well to put her into the role of the sister and gave her life in Mimik and Gestik.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Farmerkapelle played suitablely selected musical pieces and rounded the performance.
In order to award the honourable citizen's dignity, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor that, in representativeness of the then official owner Hättich, together with a part of the city council made his expectation.
Their expectation then made the three kings singers who led Hansjakob to the call: "Ah, how beautiful, there will be youth reminders of my own three kings again alive."
With their song "O Jesuyl" they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
His criticism of the Church had expressed Hansjakob the same way as his concerns about the increases in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In his homeland, behind his tomb chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"An uncalm spirit had finally found his rest and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene game.
A lot of applause and many commendative words were available from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of Neckar Riesen grows
The chances for the league stay of the sportyly elevated Ludwigsburger Bundesliga Basketballers have increased.
Because there should be a wildcard procedure, then there is less competitors for the Neckar Riesen now.
The Basketball project Hamburg Towers refuses to apply for a possible backback site.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard proceedings," said Ex-National player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hansestadt since 2012.
However, a first breathing was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't deal with the wildcard process, as long as it doesn't determine that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until May 23th, the Supreme Dusseldorf Baskets can also submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic bond accuracy.
However, the license has been denied twice to the Rhine countries.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Nightmill Church gets at the point of view
As a contribution from the city to the 150-year-old Gospel Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office devotes the last of its public themes this year on Sunday, October 27th, the Dining Church.
After the visit of the nuclear cellar museum, the Haigerlocher period should be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
Crowning endpoint is a visit to the Evening Church.
There, the leaders are told the history of the construction of the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a transient and through Catholic area.
Not least, the church also takes the view of the evening meal created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an originally faithful reproduction of the famous Roman model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point to the other half-hour tour is at the nuclear cellar museum at 15 o'clock.
Maps are available at the box of the nuclear cellar museum.
The tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Snowden could also pronounce in Russia
The former U.S. secret priest Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal General Prosecutor could either ask in writing questions or personally address the 30-year-olds in Russia.
This reported the Interfax Agency under appeal to unnamed circles which are familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified by the state, it was said.
A trip to Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the Agency quoted its source.
Because Germany was allies of the United States, Snowden threatened the extradition there, it continued
Long breathing is paid
Six men teams fought at the tennis tournament of the clubs for the winner title.

Schrilles Pieps disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested strongly in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the neck.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard is using wind plant logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the warehouse in front of the dike.
Distribute or charge the coal here as needed.
In every movement of the envelopes, a shrilled warning noise sounds over the ground.
"The signals serve security and are legally required," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the event of an unfavorable wind, this is a long way to hear - and there were some complaints of people from the city yard.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close agreement with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals with technical measures quieter.
He will also put on the open dialogue with the neighbors in the future.
Because Matthias Schrell has a lot before the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the majors in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5 meters deepened lounger shape terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can be completed here.
"In this year, we want to knack the 3 million tons brand in the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, import coal goes to power stations in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the network, about 5 million tonnes of coal imports are realistic per year.
The three ship launchers on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayerns Basketballer despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not degrade the huge optimism at the basketballers of the FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can forbid us to believe that we will also win the best team in Europe in the past two years," said Bavaria-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unhappy 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the title defendant Olympiakos Piräus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
During their first third appearance in the European king class, the Munich sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clarified enough in the decisive phases.
First, the guests created the piece of art, a 15-point backstand 13 minutes before the end, to convert into a tour before Piräus gave the game a turn again.
"We have incredibly fought back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made clear mistakes again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful commercials of the Munich who celebrated clear victories in the first two parties against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish tracker Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up Comedy in America: just a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started to tell the amount of joke directly in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the years, Fay's innovation has been developed, as last at the New York Comedy Festival.
Called into life and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“The majority of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more successful until they were too known sometime to be in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event there are events of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as of “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy beneficiary event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival also has grown the world of Comedy.
A number of Comedians, who participate at the festival this year, have become known about rather unconventional ways, such as programs on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a Sitcom in the cable television (the ironic fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has its own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation both at "Saturday Night Live" and at "Parks and Recreation", although it is most famous for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, on racial themes concentrated W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of American Comedy.
One of the largest visitors' magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed to become an honored television and film director as well as an inofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television program entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, then he sometimes walks through the street between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is pleased with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN vetomers and Germany.
"After years you have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences in the last years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way, but the nuclear chief dealer would be satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides at the end will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game comrades with machete
In Uruguay, two children were able to kill an 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12 years old boys had invited their victims to go with them on bird hunting.
With machetes and knives they armed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reports the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played in a working quarter football before their apartments.
The body was found on the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five - year - old half sister of the younger who had taken them should say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the Tathergang before the police without mentioning an attack against them, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elderly called a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily delivered to a psychiatric youth event.
Container must be in prison
Because of exploitation of human trafficking, intake, threat, insult and dangerous body injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Federal Army soldier, who worked as a doorstep after two operations in Afghanistan, gave a consent in the framework of a process agreement.
So, in five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on the line after a few weeks against their will.
He was opposed to break with violence and threats.
He retained the revenues of women who bought for him for some years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undertook contacts with women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who gave the women, he brought them to various boardelles in the southwest.
There he partially monitored them to control their revenues.
In court, the accused first claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychic limitation and thus suggested a limited debt, the 33-year-old gave a comprehensive consent.
The court had no longer to hear the damaged women.
According to a Kripo official, after a first advertisement by telephone monitoring measures, at least four other cases of outbuilding human trafficking were identified.
The abstract discussions were characterized by high aggression.
In later hearings, the damaged people would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another Witness in which one of the women had discovered blue spots throughout the body has not made any statement until now.
It is "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this metier as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He resolved from these circles and wanted to live a normal life after the prison," he said.
Oil price continues to up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price has also fallen on Friday after concerns about a high offer have overestimated a report that is growing in China's energy-hungling production sector.
The reference raw oil varieties for deliveries in December fell in Europe late morning in electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of raw oil has burdened prices over the past weeks.
The U.S. Ministry of Energy explained on Wednesday that the U.S. offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the offer increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there were references to more demand by two reports on an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This suggests a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth had increased to 7.8% in the third quarter after the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from Brent, a reference value for international raw oil, which is also used by American refiners, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Judgment blocks decision on the stop-and-frisk directive of the NYPD
On Thursday, a Bundesberufungsgericht in the USA blocked the arrangement of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-frisk program (“shows and search”) of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. appeal court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Schindlin would be suspended until a decision was taken on a call for the city.
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the program for the stopping and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the appropriate remedies, including the decision to set up a surveillance body to assist the police in modifying their Directive and the appropriate training programme.
On Tuesday, the appeal court heard the arguments for the suspension requested.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be disfellowshipped of the case, since she violated the Code of Conduct for American Judges by deciding that a judge should avoid the appearance of partyity; this was partially justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged that police officers injured the citizens' rights of tens of thousands of people, because they in an inappropriate way targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including reforms in Directives, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program with cameras carried on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, New York City declared himself ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
A oral negotiation for the calling of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics were criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
This type of control has been in different forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an age of 684.330 in 2011, most of which were black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all minorities were filed a complaint that developed into a collective complaint.
The supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-free program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and more effective police and influence the way other police presidents use the regulation.
Opposers believe that the changes would dampen the police's morals, but not criminality, nor would money waste and not solve the broader problem of a police that is under pressure after the destruction of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice that was constitutional, but only reform the nature of the implementation of the controls by the NYPD.
The Happiness of the Dreaming Kamele
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels succeeded
With this evidence, the first president Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Halfende Hände".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have significant successes.
The first Chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the Gynäkologue Henne carried out numerous operations on several trips on site.
During the speeches pictures were shown by the inputs on a large canvas, so the guests of the anniversary were able to take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The association's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to become active in consultative function at the club.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn in the record time of almost one week created the hospital station in Socogim, an Elendsviertel on the outskirts of the capital – honorably.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is intended to be eliminated in Nagold.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, says Henne, for example acceleration against Burn-out.
Due to the political turmoil in the country, it was not possible to do as many travels as planned, but many medicalists came to Germany to host here in various areas.
In addition, containers are regularly sent to Africa with material, according to medical devices, medications, association material, hospital beds and brilliants in March this year.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered a rich local colour by telling from Mauritania from Mercedes-Fahrzeugs converted to the mobile goatstall and painting the experiences of the Stammheimer musicians who traditionally support the club during their Mauritania tour.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of accounting as a young Member.
When he became aware of the loss of money on the road, he decided to help the Africans in control of a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It's not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking for verifying a tip
The former news of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly introduced “telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation” in trying to confirm a false tip on an affair of Charles Clarke, former interior minister.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in Old Bailey that in May 2005 News of the World had heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special consultant” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's Voicemails, and followed them, but Coulson also called on and left news as the court heard.
"Coulson, now publisher of the NotW, is, according to the prosecutor's opinion, nobody standing before the home of people and hoping to attack them on fresh acts, but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said NotW is using three procedures to research stories: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disagrees, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
rumors about an affair Clarkes were first attacked by the Feature Redaction of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A band with Voicemails from their phone from at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
When the researchers ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following contents: “I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as the former interior minister David Blunkett.
The jurymen heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced an affair with a married woman when he was lying with Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks argued that they had conspired with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned rich tax, the French football will actually pass through the first strike since 1972.
A simplification meeting is endless.
In the conflict of the Reichensteuer tax, the government and the professional football in France have been maneuvered into a sackgasse after a failure to clarify.
President François Hollande received on Thursday in the Paris Élysée Palace association and association representatives and also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to save the football of the planned 75% tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies of the country should pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November was now also announced, the Chief Association of Profi Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The playdays in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between November 29 and December 2 are therefore missing.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in planning early," mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Some 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the measures planned to ask questions, to express concerns and to introduce ideas.
Häußler stated: "The final decisions are the members of the municipal council."
The flooding water, which met unprepared on May 15, 2009, had been an incredible event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, said Häußler.
A river survey was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many buildings as possible is the goal," said Häußler.
Based on the planning of protection against a German weather service, it is statistically every 100 years of expectation of floodwater.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surplus.
This is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had caused significant damage in 2009 in Gechingen, corresponded to a 1000-year-old floodwater.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, some four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can expect about 70 percent of national grants.
However, Häußler pointed out that there is only funding if a general concept is implemented.
The municipality is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An immense planning and approval procedure has to be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides local measures in the flow of the Irm river from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants used the opportunity to address their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why dams and restraints were no longer planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, expert designer of the commissioned engineering office Forest and Corbe from Hillsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it requires the interplay of all proposed measures to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, the most economical solution is to be found, says Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Humility has existed in those of the old place, who have suffered from an overload of the channel network, even in normal thunderstorms.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the directives for canal systems are other than that for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two- to three-year rain events could be forced.
The dimension of the waste water channels would be greater than millions.
Serious injury after collision
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were severely injured in frontal collision on the Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately spared the road completely, but could first say little about the accident.
However, there are several witness statements that should be evaluated.
The 19-year-old Lenker of a VW Gulf headed towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles sprang together, with the woman so hardly tied up that the firearm needed almost half an hour to release them from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of accidents was not explained at first.
Both disturbances came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained completely locked about two hours.
You could call him the US Dostojewski.
Philip K. Dick was a God-seeker, a metaphysist, his novels and stories have something serial as well.
Amazing the relativeity in the outside: the shaking eyes, the bart, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to understand with his massive oeuvre as founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as American prophets, who are quite something in their own country.
Some titles were published in the Heyne Publisher, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the empire of stunning technical progress, coupled with Paranoia, safety deer and the faith to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of John's revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had added to his brain.
He's understood, early, that the computers are Divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a man differs from a machine, the Creator of his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Midderity Report" comes from 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
It is developed here the principle of "pre-crime", "pre-crime", which is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles our horror, Mutants look into the future - and the police take over.
"We collect individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll take them before they can commit a crime."
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for this we have a criminal camp full of Pesudo criminals." They read time streams.
They assume that badness is happening and preventing the criminal idea from being implemented.
Dick's narrative works like the blue break for the anti-terror laws and the NSA's hearing noise.
Antizipation of the attack: Obama's drone philosophie and practice also works.
But Dick's story isn't finished yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more division of violence, the military controls everyday life - and what's left by the state.
Then the supervisor itself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system turns through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents his own requirements.
Do not only purchase mistakes and victims, but build on them.
The system creates the risk it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Spices about Merkel in Russia
The former U.S. secret priest Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. sphere about Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Bundesanwaltschaft could either ask in writing questions or also meet the 30-year-olds personally in Russia, the Interfax Agency reported.
Previously, Hans-Christian Ströbele had met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about affairs.
NSA explorations strengthen company paranoia for public surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
Under the direction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism Anti-Terrorism (BVT), the German Interior Secret Service, he should photograph the roof of the US Outside Post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Claper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again stated in September that the US did not use the possibilities of foreign spying to steal the operating secrets of foreign companies on the order of U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or profit.
But since Edward Snowden, the one-time employee who became Whistleblower, started publishing his filling horn to US surveillance secrets, European governments and heads of business are no longer sure whether they can speak to the director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has pioneered the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the company paranoia has brought to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The Fass to Overrun brought the unveilment that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was confused, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can come into sight, then corporate managements are certainly also potential goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany has to wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now posed a nearly as high risk as China, when it comes to industrial spying and data stealing, such a survey published in July by the consultant company EY.
However, there was no evidence in the documents passed by Snowden that the US had passed the operating secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet possibilities and should reduce their dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical in this regard.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"This does not work so," says Hasso Plattner, president of SAP's German software manufacturer.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, it should not have been killed 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything, up to the IT industry.
Nevertheless, reach and technical refinements of U.S. spionage authorities discovered by Snowden have shocked companies who had previously seen the largest spying risk in China.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US are subject to the legal proceedings there and are potentially threatened.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, after the unveiled US data mining activities with prism, about ten percent of the members not in the United States refused to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers who did not exist a year ago – it says: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that these are physically staying in this legal area?”
Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely, that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be monitored at any price.
That economic spying takes place is not surprising.
That's always the case.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Chemical Company BASF.
The Americans are pioneering us on a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management of companies usually does not spoil about the counter-measures that you have taken, because that gives advantages to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been bleeding that taking a free USB stick on a trade fair or the unawakened leaving of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, Executive Board member at Autohersteller Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing devices.
The German BVT recommends leaders to use simple prepaid phones when they travel abroad because smartphones may be complicated.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain attackable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources in order to effectively protect operating secrets from unauthorized access," warns BVT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic spying by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February France, Russia and Israel, the US National Intelligence Estimate was arranged behind China to reach two of the countries who served to obtain economic data from hacking.
A member of the board of a German Blue Chip company agreed when it comes to economic spionage, then “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarciini, former director of the DCRL interior service, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The secret services know very accurately that all countries, even when they work together in the fight against terror, pioneer their allies.”
Hechingen: Fair answers wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery journey that man can make," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration succeeded, now gave a special trade fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Deputy were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The Retro look has kept intake again.
This starts at the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In the front, the frequent roasted and embroidered clothing are closed, often with a veil, on the back they go down the back and often end in a loop.
However, the spirits separate, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Clothesmüller.
The suit with the west and Plastron is dominated by men, but it can also be chosen cream-coloured or brown combinations.
The choice of the local is important, it was explained.
Jewelless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain pointed to its own offer in the remise.
Anyone who wants to go ahead with the kiss then has an offer for your link.
"Buts are also popular for boys' divorces," he says.
Romance is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding images.
More and more in fashion the "After Wedding Photo" - so recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothing, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower Arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can enjoy guests stylishly.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable festival.
Dog Friends Successful
For a repeated time, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful on a Rally Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dogs, he scored 94 points in the Class Beginner and secured the fifth place, and with Marley, 15 months old, he brought it to place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in class 1, stood the critical views of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teen, whose body was found in a rolled ring matt in the high school tour hall, are convinced that their son was murdered, the lawyer of the family declared on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on 11 January in a upright mat, standing behind the tribune in the school turn hall.
The Sheriffs of Lowndes County inquiry officials concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which doubts the family of the 17-year-old.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff had concluded.
“They believe that every logic is in violation of the laws of physics as well as of the healthful human mind," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to learn and returned in the body bag," he commented.
U.S. attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation to the death of Johnson, since a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was explained at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they also lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore said to reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that Johnson was dying from the consequences of a 'position-related deterioration'.
A second autopsy, however, caused another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added, if there are sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation to the death of Johnson, he will order the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriffs authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a court in the south of Georgia ordered that the authorities should release all surveillance videos that the consultants have verified.
The teenager's parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence of how he died.
CDC publishes allergy directives for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for the handling of food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such directives that the US government has issued, since the number of children who are schooling is increasing with food allergies.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin predominantly – the auto-injection of the epiPen brand is most commonly used – to meet potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislatures in the Federal States have recently changed the rules so that schools can easily keep Epinephrin prevail.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels as if something presses on my tongue," "My tongue feels as if a hair lies on it" or "My tongue shrinks".
Parents of intersexual children can choose 'Good indefinite'
Germany is the first European nation, in which a third gender is recognized for children born with unclear Genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned steady male or female.
According to the new law, parents must no longer explain sex for such children, but may “undetermined” or “undefined” indicate on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take pressure from parents so that they do not have to make overlapsed decisions in relation to operations for gender allocation in newborns, and fight discrimination of intersexual people.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said: “I am neither man nor woman.”
I'm staying the flicking work created by doctors. I'm shaken and full of scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children is not born every year as a boy or as a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group covered by the diagnosis “Sexual Difference Disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (eier peaches or hods) or unusually developed genetals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend that you use the best available information on sexual allocation if a provision is not possible and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before you decide – if any – for surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialized in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law “kling for a good thing.”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but most children do not,” he said.
One could make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for how identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity at all is not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people are different from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not sexually related, but is conditional on their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hairing, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital organs or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not consistent with the gender image, boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate on official documents male, female or third sex.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognised as the world's first “genderless” person after a court had granted the lifelong maintenance of a ‘undefined’ gender status.
In addition to M and W, German statements will have a third allocation, X for intersexual, said the Ministry of Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender themes are still controversial, according to a newsletter on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French Members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the “generation theory” should be removed from school books.
The US-American website Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law, explaining: “If the world is distorted into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two other pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to baby zone that she found it better when babies are assigned to a gender at birth.
“The parent is stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born both with male and female sex were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek God, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine viewed the sex as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted, after now knowing how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feels when it grows with the sex assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency”, said Drescher.
When such a child was born, the surgeon was not called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of the treatment of children with non-unclear genitalities goes back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the sex is formal.
He expressed the term "human identity" and argued, social and environmentally-related offences – as parents educate a child – interagated with the genes and hormones of a child and practised whether a person is considered male or female.
But in a case known under the title "John/Joan" from 1966, his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated in a poured circumcision to cast the child completely and to remove his dogs and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation, but not what he was”, says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these gender operations have come to the public, which are “not happy with the result”.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomen, but two-large genitalia.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and the dogs were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD by which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of genitalia.
After learning the truth, he changed to the male identity, received testosterone injections and let his breasts be removed.
The surgery made it unfruitable.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for the fact that intersexual people are perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the Law Group Advocates for Informed Choice in California, ensures that the German law can “comfort to stamp and stigmatize”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign to the child a ‘undefined’," she said.
We are afraid that favours interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait for it.
But yet we do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law, because " adults are able to recognize as a third gender".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex," she said.
The German law concerns the allocation at birth.
This is not a struggle to force small children at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologian from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual disagreement and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "authorized" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomen but has a DSD called complete Androgen Resistance.
Due to the recipe defect of target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no egg sticks.
Katie is now 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff in the child psychiatrie.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or a body mother.
"The law gives parents space, which does not have to be overwhelmed", said Baratz.
It gives them time to make different tests and to clarify things and so give them time before they write “manly” or “womanly”.
In this way everything is okay – one raises the child and loves it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parent's happiness.
And you don't have to overdue a surgery that can no longer be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are exciting because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that fits better to him – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girls by shot from car
Unknown when shooting out of a car, a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt injured.
The killers probably fired on Thursday evening in Genthin with an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
That told the police in Burg.
The girl was easily injured on the left guard.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot on a bus stop.
Cracked a disc.
Then they took away.
The criminal police found it on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection can look back at Kempten on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called for only two odd children who threw them against home facades.
Since the house owners recognized this in time and removed the egg residues immediately, there should have been no damage.
In addition, some Sylvester Böller were probably burned in the city area, but there was no damage here too.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was included with cloud paper and his cycling blends were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his cycling blinds in the immediate vicinity of all, which the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries is dreaming.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only minutes of public transport.
"You hope they don't fear spiders?", Waltraud Ries asks and shows a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern that at age the many stairs to the house and the apartment no longer can handle, she explains.
In addition: Since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifty-fiftyer has had to learn what it means to move with disabilities from floor to floor.
Recently, a book of her appeared on the topic 'Happy living in age - What housing form is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on at age', she starts to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, at mid fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is among the few people who are at all talking about the subject 'woning in age'.
Most of them are drowning it as long as it goes.
Old will be only the others," she says smilingly.
Only when the suffering pressure is really big, you're thinking.
"Then it can be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in the age.
"Which housing form, however, is always an individual decision," she explains.
I don't have a solution for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also get sick.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the language of the country, one can also be united in the Dolce Vita,' the author of the book gives postal agents to consider.
Among their models are classical care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited pensioner WG.
At age, everyone has his tricks and Mackens.
"For me wouldn't be such a living community," she meant with an eyedrinker.
Not even as in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"In the age you just need your withdrawal rooms," says Ries.
However, the bookwriter does not want to exclude the fact that an elderly residential community can still work.
This must then be different from the classical student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest,' she believes.
With this view, it is not alone in the capital of the country.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home for as long as it goes' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital of the country.
Your service advises people around the topic 'become older'.
That is why older people would often also buy inconveniences and restrictions, only to stay in their habitual environment, that is also the experience of the Foundation of Good Tests.
Today there are many opportunities to make the house or the apartment accessible.
Ries recommends all those who are concerned with the old-right reconstruction of their house or apartment to inform themselves thoroughly and not to commission the first craftsman.
Today there is also for the old-right reconstruction specialists.
Even in the rental apartment, this can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior architect clears up.
But not always the existing apartment can be redesigned old-right and thus accessible even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairway within the apartment, the path that is also paved with stairs to the door of the apartment would be a far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she looks more than before the spider at her apartment door.
USA wants to continue to pursue Snowden criminal law
The US has not changed their attitude to the former US secret staff Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of having unauthorizedly distributed secret information.
Therefore, he had to take a criminal procedure in the USA, said the spokesman of the US Foreign Ministry, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements of Snowden would also not change.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green Politist Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US not to threaten him further with punishment.
Psaki stressed that the statements of a parliamentarian and not the statements of a German member of the government were in the case of strikes.
Secret Service Story Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clarified.
This has made clear to the former NSA employees sought by the United States in a letter not addressed, published by the Green Politist Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, Federal Day and General Federal Lawyers.
The letter shall be replaced by the following:
To the Responsibles
I was asked to write you about your mass monitoring investigation.
I was named Edward Joseph Snowden and was employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became a witness of systematic violations of my government, which caused me from moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent hat that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I am currently exiling and enjoy temporary asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political action, both in the USA and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as high officials - including the United States - have assessed the disclosure of a system of comprehensive surveillance, which is not accountable to anyone, as a service to the public.
These spionage revealings led to many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the former misuse of public confidence.
The benefit for society from these findings is increasingly clear, while at the same time the risks purchased were clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat this as a treacherous breakthrough and strives to criminalize and defend political expression.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that with the support of the international community, the government of the United States will take this detrimental attitude.
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been educated, I will be able to participate in the responsible information about the media statements, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and in accordance with the law.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for their efforts to maintain the international law that protects us all.

Children's garden has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
In its recent meeting, the municipal council agreed to the sale in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "adjusted" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," says Maier.
The budget was 100 000 euros.
It is still not clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
To the mayor it is right that winterlingen have given responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and therefore no longer have to come up for the entertainment of the house, like heating, looking for the garden and cleaning up the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier welcomes.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The music club Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the guesthouse Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the tactstock at 19.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Some 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the musical pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully manage the first musical hock.
Report: Obama campaign considered to replace bids with Hillary Clinton
The closest consultants of President Barack Obama have thought in secret to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most noteworthy surprise of the long - expected work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times is a copy of the book that appears next, and on Thursday evening she reported that the president's top consultants had conducted "wide group meetings and surveys" at the end of 2011 to find out whether it is better for Obama's dwindling hope of re-electing if he drops bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and of the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect on the survey values to exchange former foreign minister Clinton against the Vice Presidents.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the closest consultant of the president – including Daley, the former campaign leader Obamas, Jim Messina, and the former leading consultant of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
"Double Down" claims that Daley had been at the top of the efforts to exchange bids despite their "sense, personal conditions" before finally decided to make such a move after the data showed that the Candidature Clintons would "not significantly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace bids with Clinton.
"I expressed a number of things that should be considered, and that was one of them," Daley explained the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had horrible survey values at that time, so we thought, "For God's will, what do we do?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as ‘bound care’, Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign had been operated for the re-electing of considerable effort to find out whether such a train was paying out for the urns.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent for surveys and focus groups if you do not seriously think about something," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about a exchange.
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his former boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe that the President of the possible change was "conscious", the former boss admitted that Obama was "possible" that Obama knew of it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political consents had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thinks Obama knew nothing about the investigations about whether to let bid in the elections.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
What happens on the way with my email?
E-mail is actually called electronic letter.
Was the e-mail e-mail in the drafting of the Internet service similar to that of the conventional mail technically implemented the letter secret?
The conception of early Internet services focused on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been considered to create a stable foundation for a sound exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than to a sealed letter.
If the user sends an e-mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
The e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends the mail in the first step to the mail server of its service provider.
For example, if she had a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route the mail can run via some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will conventional emails be read through the network on their way?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the road.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail is carrying a damaging program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
Also, the provider checks whether it is a harsh and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or removed into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unfamiliar people also read the emails?
The probability that unauthorized persons read an e-mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to capture or note e-mails.
This includes possible illegal exaggerations.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be encrypted effectively for parsing.
With a high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that even those who have communicated with who can not be recognized without delay.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the mostly privately used post offices.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had last fallen, GMail was able to make it clear by Google.
Mother in the Forest Sharpened and Retirement Donated
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg slept a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to pay their pension and nursing money.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother after investigations by the police in the forest.
At first, he was hiding the death of the 89-year-olds, then he deleted the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time, the need for the nursing mother was no longer taken.
The pensioner told the investigator that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to detect.
They found out that they had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last maintained them.
The 67-year-old finally gave his mother's death.
According to the police, an obduction did not give any evidence of capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first shining ice in the dark – using quallen.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the sea animals and created a shining leak.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on quallen and Chinese scientists were able to convince the shining protein artificially.
The ice cream responds when eating with the tongue, which raises the pH value in the protein and triggers the luminaire.
Chris explains that the eating ice reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shine – the more you leak, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value increases and the ice shines.
We tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because the quallen illuminator is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says: “I want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is impossible in itself because of the light break that is caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream exists; but I suppose we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a Qualle made by Chinese scientists artificially
The TSV Morsum is still without any point after six days of play in the Handball Association League.
It is now for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to be Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts new for us.
"I hope we finally have our heads free," Ehlers feels optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has its complete frame available.
Daverden too, like we're going to play tempo.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
In the first place, however, it is important to increase in the covering, which has recently left everything other than a safe impression.
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz, who was the first season victory against Nordhorn, is clearly relaxed.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
Nevertheless, Panitz wants to go down in Morsum to start a series.
Missing Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Jugendly Joost Windsuß, who is active with double play law at the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was young, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today, I'm more like Halloween-Muffel.
In the last two years, I haven't declared myself willing to distribute from my apartment from sweets, and I'm sure I'm not going to do it this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep as regards Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be accurate – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion for sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the US association of retailers (NRF).
One thing I'm looking forward to every Halloween then again are the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the U.S. $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting unliving objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothing, they can now also embodie seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of Zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk-World-Männer will create it in the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are Zombies, Batman, Pirates and Hexen.
I suppose it's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and weren't alone to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As for sweets, we're not clever.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate gels, lushes, bonuses and rubber berries.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Trade, who pass through the quarters with the word "sweets or saure".
In fact, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't pretend – eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweet Products Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion maize grains.
It's a mystery that I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses in which it spucks.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized spike houses in the United States, which achieve $500 million redemption, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just ping into the pants and then put the friends on Facebook, where you don't get rid of them again, and then one of the type on which you stand leave a comment like “night face expression”.
But let's finally come to the shorts.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Kürbis when we were children, and the cutting of a turbolic leaven is like the smacking of the Christmas tree – something we made from little.
Fortunately, the “Baby in the Kürbis” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up to snatch the kürbis and not to sit in it.
This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for shorts, says the US Census Bureau.
The lattice, slowly rotting in the pregnant garden, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of cabbages were harvested this year.
If you want to point correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and cut some chickens from their 921 kilos of heavy curbis.
Residential fire in Helmbrechts: rescue forces mountains demolished body
The firearm had to go out in Helmbright on late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night on Friday.
The rescue forces hold a cold body out of the house.
Rescue forces have found a collared body in a three - family house in a fire in Helmbrecht.
Whether it's an inhabitant is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firearm arrived, the flames already hit out of a window.
The forces went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned completely.
The whole ground floor was damaged.
All other residents weren't at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building is no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause for the fire was not at first clear.
Germany's largest Landeskirche has launched an offensive to recruit for the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible pastor deficiency: The Evangelical-Lutherian Landeskirche Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will be halfed by the present position until 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily expiry itself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche first commissioned a pastor in a full position to enthusiasm young people for theology study.
Nowadays, fewer young people decide to study theology after the Abitur.
Burfien reiterates this to the process of decimation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my calendar and can place my priorities where it is important for me.
Pastors could be very close to human beings as an anxiety.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
Surely more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This is true to the young people of today, who are not only about career, but about a senseful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 Pastors are currently retired per year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study start their vicariate.
In thinly populated edges such as resin, emsland, or Wendland, it could be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and invite the theology to do so.
The theology study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point-gurte as well as a freespeaking system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with care of Bowler work mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people who are looking for tension and adventure, as well as a accessible way to world class events.
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare new ones for the straps and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge-Wagen – that will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day at the Defender Challenge in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Called firearm to rescue a dog that was trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock spring in a stone break
Cocker-Spaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the stone break in her miserable situation
Firemen sailed off on rock wall and saved the dog before the safe death
The fire gun managed to secure a dog, which was fixed on a 15 meters high spring in a rock wall.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the stone break in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and to thank the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dogs and published calls for help in social networks when she had escaped into the stone break after the small road accident.
About 2:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the beached Ruby on the 15 meters high paragraph in the burst of stone.
The technical rescue team of Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the place and sailed down to the rescue of Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was as frozen as stiff.
But now she's fine.
She then eated a few dog cubits.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a great luck.”
It was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was given to the veterinarian to study but did not detect anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Seeing salvation was anxious.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the poor.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too big and it would be broken down, it would probably be crashed.
The firemen did great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid she would fall down, but she remained upstairs.”
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer to Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the old dryer in the evening, and that “he was drowning me when I was 18.”
She added: “It's been a long time ago, and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “reasoned categorically that he had ever tried to approach Katy Perry”.
The representative added: “Perhaps it has confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album “Prism” landed at Anhieb on place 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European deflection gives the Schots the choice
A new day, a new horror story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a precondition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passing controls in Berwick and a border secured with stalk wire along the Hadrian wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic advantages that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this played no role in the headlines, as expected.
No one has also mentioned that the EU Member States often correct their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-respect for Brussels would be only a small consent for what one really wants from the Scotlands.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has come in the years so that she already resembles a fossil: I first heard the "independence means passing control" units at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost when repeating this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke against that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for Europe's unification after the war has come to an end.
With the Eurocrisis, the Europe project has officially died.
Overall in the EU, parties who are opposed to the EU or who want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party was able to make an alternative for Germany – only this year – almost five million votes at the Federal Day election in September and thus effectively displace the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan of creating a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Due to the strict savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is required by holding the common currency, many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to do so.
Without the possibility of devaluating the local currency, Southern Europe will be recovered from Germany with a built-in productivity disadvantage.
The only way is to reduce wages and public expenditure – motivated by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind the current problems of Etat and Monetary Affairs.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives ordained by Brussels – a code for the granting of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays the double for electricity and the fourfold for gas compared with the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we could see in Grangemouth.
All wages in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner from cheap American shelf gas.
As a result, a revolt raises, especially in France, the EU's former Cheerleader.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be held in chess and lifted Paris at the height of Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe’s own economic policy, with which the attacked French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pens legally judged, EU-frauded Front National has just won a decisive success and thus referred to the governing socialists in place three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically constitute advantages for the left.
What makes Le Pen with her newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to avoid an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are well cut off in these elections – and that is very well possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to say: the growing interest against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro in no way further.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) nations' favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distant itself from this project in the hope of melting into the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific area suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including Berlin and Brussels, what they can say.
I suppose Scotland could drive very well in a looser European association if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-founded Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider dealing with Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – notably – the most successful political movement against savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) reductions to be responsible for Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Life Dem Coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for independence now, only to be forced by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Getting grown faster
Afro-American and hispanese girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white agemates, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean puberty directly
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend of early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and shame at the age of seven or eight years?
At the annual conference of American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and constituted a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually this is not a sign of how quickly puberty is going on," explained Kaplowitz.
Obviously displays of development, such as growing breasts, shame and acetal hair, as well as body odor, appear in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the appearance of the first rule bleeding) over the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Frequently Pubertät bei Mädchen: The essential adviser for dealing with this often occurring problem".
Time is the most accurate test as the puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is “fruiteif” if the breast increase is accompanied by an increase of growth before an age of eight years.
In most cases the process slows down or stagnates – something that a child’s doctor can monitor closely.
In faster advances, tests may be indicated by an endikronologist so that serious problems such as tumour or cysten can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defense of another consequence: premature ageing of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are oriented at the age of the child, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is reluctant to medication, but he admits: “The suppression of puberty can reduce behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, to be unlike her ages.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had received her days with ten.
Even if there were first signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came frightened and excited from school to home because she was the first in her friends' circle.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no clear evidence of the cause of hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys come to puberty like girls before.
Caplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine, making a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, Afro-American and hispanese girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white agemates.
There are different explanations.
Global seems to be an early puberty influenced by all possible things, from economic conditions across the climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys already grow face and shame hair, the trend to a full-initial former puberty is not as profound as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and shame hair is widespread even in babies and infants.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician how to talk to their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay quiet, the child normally responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even when it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders about seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a discussion about the width of seats in the tourist class at long distance flights, which indicates the tone for a bitter collapse on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seat width, which passengers are offered in long flights in the tourist class – not always those who most seek airlines, but this proven space represents the key to the efficiency claims in the latest airplanes of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week Airbus demanded an industry standard that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inch) in the tourist class, but the U.S. Archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide that.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance flights and expect record orders from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the plane is designed – in particular whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the given economic results that the new “Mini-Jumbo” design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" holds 406 people at seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide and allow for ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transporter 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aeroplane agants often share Hiebe on technical details using advertisements in the specialist press.
Airbus now appeals to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertisement war and showed money providers a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant, and the title: "Will you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are closer than regional Turbo props," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In view of changing diet habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern longitudinal journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health.
According to American health statistics, the taille range of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rivals are holding up to a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body range of the newly baptized "Jet set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on the seating measures and says that it is not in the assessment of the manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between flight tariffs and equipment.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
"It is really about to give airlines flexibility to do what they believe they need to be successful," explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver von Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, more elbow freedom is concerned, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly a subject that can affect the transactions.
Behind the conflict, a race for airplane orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars by listing prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
Reuters reported for the first time in July that the seat layout is the driving force behind the conflict with the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine longitudinal designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements Boeings on the results depend partly on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in 777.
The rising costs per unit are still lower than those used in machinery with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore quetting more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s suggested that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper flight tariffs.
"Aighteen inches of seats would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin facilities, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world's traveling jet sellers even have a tape to measure the establishment in the competition.
Even if they are awarding the comfort, all manufacturers also offer Jets with high-competitive design for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but hasn't sold yet, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of the adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats for some jets on the slopes.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to be published but could detract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the garaus
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking.
One single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Prior to human tests, further trials are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and try all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches”, Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified in such a way that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant current of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, making a smoker learn no nicotine height.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered nicotine contributed their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination had taken an outtime, the researchers explained that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the section Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
According to Professor Crystal, a future vaccine for humans could be given children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use him to stop.
“They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicot vaccine, and that helps them to deter the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but at the same time warned that further research was necessary.
Tripodi contested to be influenced by Obeid
Against the former Minister of the Labour Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a investigation is initiated by the State Corruption Supervisor.
The former NSW minister argues that at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, the regimes for marital disturbance have changed, which had concealed participation in three lands in the state of control.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) expanded its investigations on whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of State in that way, to extend loan contracts on the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operate two restaurants and a cafe, without having to prolong their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is determined because of the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's concealed interest in the lands, after Tripodis had said earlier deputy barshine Lynne Ashpole on Thursday accordingly.
In years of discussion that started in 2005, the government had pushed public tenders for the Pacht contracts.
The guards were opposed and wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the cargo contracts for companies on the Circular Quay, which submitted the Obeids annually, were extended 2.5 million dollars without a public invitation to tender.
Tripodi, who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, originally pronounced public tenders.
But he refused to have made the changes to Obeid's requests, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had forced to transform the government's pacht rules.
One of the ICAC's telephone subscriptions showed discussions from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading official who had changed to the port department after he had worked under Obeid in the fishing authority.
"Is the subject of the drafting of commercial disapproval schemes in this telephone conversation?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitively not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighting aircraft attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a destination in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a leading government member confirmed Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the goal was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visa could be subject to "echteness test"
The government considers, within the framework of extended measures, an "echteness test" for foreign workers with 457 visa.
If the test is introduced, it will be used via a criterion that will prevent the 457 to be used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the accession of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government's proposal was published after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be considered by Australia's neighbours as insults.
“Autumn explanations such as ‘Austria’ and ‘Australian first set up’ are a very inadequate relapse in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to take an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures once addressed by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who left yesterday to talk about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still considered.
If the 'equality criteria' are adopted, a visa applicant may be examined whether 'the application is real in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking or is personally linked'.
Companies could also be obliged to take account of the number of 457 fishermen after, in the past, companies who first wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally set up hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old asylumant probably died in a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 ice railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England be achieved at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “will bring Britain closer”.
The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed train connection between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost for the construction of the high-speed road between London and North England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which is in conversation with Transport Scotland, has HS2 Ltd commissioned to look for further route capacities and travel period improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings together Britain and its cities closer."
We go ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are faced with a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish state secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today the announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael called on "unmisable" to use the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection is the potential of enormous economic advantages for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK.”
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for a high-speed railway connection in Scotland, which creates advantages for everyone and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that already plans the Scottish government.
I am looking forward to examining the inquiry report with the British ministers next year and jointly adopting the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian passengers must also continue to disable tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the USA to loosen the regulations for such devices.
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) enables US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers on their devices can read e-books, see or play videos during critical flight phases, if they are in the "aviation mode".
During the majority of the flight, passengers are already allowed, but many people find it angry that they are not allowed to read their e-books when starting and landing.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the US airlines must do a lot of work, but do not follow immediate plans to amend their rules.
CASA also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft", it has been stated.
The subject is subject to provisions to which airlines have to maintain the safety at any time, and passengers must comply with the safety instructions given by cabin personnel.
Virgin has already conducted conversations with CASA about an extension of the use of his Wi-Fi maintenance system on flights and explains that one is open to change, but it would have to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer (drahtless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas said that you will remain with the current rules until further.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices should not be used when starting and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules shall apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations where passengers can benefit, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different effect in American societies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disturbances through mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer education.
“After a airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can permit passengers to use more portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book reading devices and smartphones at any level”, the FAA announced.
In rare cases in bad view, the crew will instruct passengers to disable the devices during landing.
The group also recommended to stew more heavy devices safely under the seat or in the boxes over the seats when starting and landing.
In front of the district tour against Schalke, co-involved BVB trailers with lamp missiles had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Football League against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost already spenstic acoustic that offered the viewer until just before the attack of the Federal League game between the German Vice Champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans were listening with their songs.
On the other hand, the southern tribunals, where the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented exceptionally silent: no songs, no battle calls.
The podest of the Capo, who otherwise coordinates the common combustion, remained unspoiled.
And at the front of the tribune a large flag with the inscription "Section of Stadium Forbidden".
Only as a Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, a short-term jubel opened.
When his teammates followed, there were loud vocals and wounding scarfs - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribunal there was nothing.
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again counted the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for celebrations.
It was only five minutes before the capo collapsed his podest - and the to date just with hands tangible tension escaped in a loud cry, as Dickel as usual asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
The last thing was like always the southern tribute on the line - and finally here was again as usual as the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derbysieger stands up" came with an appetite from the southern tribunal, everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a response to the events of the past days.
Immediately before districtby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB pendants had fired light missiles into the viewers and to the place - and almost torhoeder Roman Weidenfeller had hit.
The game was late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tips of Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and believes that Watzkes words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuttings for the entire Ultra Movement," announced the BVB boss on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbid this," he said.
We can't give up the zero tolerance policy in matters of pyrotechnology.
In addition, the ultras have been shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction by the end of the next week.
"It's going to be cutting," insured Watzke.

Pendants tree in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
In a pand house at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden armreif, a ring and a pair of earrings to be able to pay the school fees of their daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1.730 euros) each month as a administrative employee and also work for her husband, she explains the monthly family income.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of households increases – is so large that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, this week became the third pendulum listed on the Singapurian stock exchange.
The coating of jewelry is not only a faster way to get money – 1.300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loan.
Typically, pedal houses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pand houses offer the advantage that no review of creditworthiness or income evidence is required, so loans are possible faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to pand houses after families feel the pressure by increasing cost of living and increasing the debt of households and consumers.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economic spaces, families with lower and medium-sized income are looking for pand houses in order to compensate for the difference in the disturbing economy.
This week, the Rating Agency referred to Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly by rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
The Agency estimates that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent still in 2008.
Economic operators are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week almost came out of a technical recession.
On Thursday the data showed an ongoing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the final effect, this means that in view of the increase in costs, people will try to complement their income in the medium to lower segment (the income scale) wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks at the gold prizes over the last two years have strengthened the trend to sponsor personal objects, as people use the opportunity to convert the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the objects sponsored in the 200 cottages of the city state are gold.
The people say: “The gold price looks good, let us eat large mottles gold chain and get back next month.”
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pedal business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branches in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yes Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this by 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it took this week with the stock exchange course in Singapore.
While some creditors had come into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yes explains that penetration houses not only boil more favourable interest than other lenders but also did not directly increase debts.
"Kunden lend goods they already own, and the liquids of personal assets do not increase the budgetary shift," she explains.
The borrowing business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pounds are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax in order to put gold bars and Rolex doors, for which they get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
We come to customers from every social shift.
"These are wealthy ones who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small enterprises who have to bridge the bottlenecks in the cash flow," says yes.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service exploder Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany learn the ever more brilliant NSA affairs.
According to the Green-Bundestag MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-Secretial Service staff would declare in a German prosecutorship or before an investigation committee.
Snowden pointed to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government is based on the hard conditions associated with the savings package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth would take "unconsuming measures" to eliminate a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island State, a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian colleague Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has launched an emergency rescue package which, in our view, concerns the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325-million dollar package comprises 31 million dollars of emergency aid for election services.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopedic interventions and treatments for grey stars, aim to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for daily hospitals in Hobart and Launceston, better post-stational care, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas that clinic workers have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister stood on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state has to maintain the current level of financing in order to obtain money from Commonwealth and reports monthly about where the additional funds were spent.
A three-country Commission will be set up and will ensure that the state provides health services as effective and efficient as possible.
According to Wilkie today, the $325 million would only benefit little if "they were not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the Federal Aids will make a major contribution to taking the public health system of the state from the worries list," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely compensate for recent cuts.
However, the health spokesman of the opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is just a "flatter solution".
"We are therefore in the situation today because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government almost half a billion dollars gets out of the system and puts in the Commonwealth 300 million and then do as if the good news were.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package was spent for additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important bodies for the manufacture of chemical weapons and Gift Gas counition, the global surveillance group for chemical weapons on Thursday declared, while there were severe collisions in the north of the country near one of the locations where toxic substances are suspected to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had already been killed three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, which had set up Damascus's organisation in The Hague to destroy or make all the equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons inoperable, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid 2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
According to the estimates, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including senfgas and the nerve gas of Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when battles took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, the experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses here, as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in Britain reported.
The activist group, who persecutes the number of deaths via a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people died.
There are 61.067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the Army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 are governmental-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah milits.
Also among the dead were 2,202 desert army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of opposition, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100.000.
This number has not been updated until now.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said that on Thursday there were losses on both sides, but didn't call any details.
The fights underscore the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors are exposed, because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arms arseen is a race against the time in the midst of a tremendous civil war.
According to the OPCW, who works closely with the United Nations, the team was “not convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has experienced its destruction”.
Therefore, ‘no further inspection activities are currently planned’.
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of the verifications and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, the visit of two institutions had not been possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two locations had been “returned ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme there had been transferred to other inspected bodies.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that could not visit the OPCW inspectors.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I draw the hat from the braveness and courage you all have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organization in an OPCW comment.
For three years now, the mostly sunnitic Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and their security forces, many members of the Alawites, an abolition of the Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the Observatory Group, Rami Abdurrahman said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he explained.
Anger on Judgment for Bomb Legs of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had died in 2002 during the bombing attack in Bali responded anxiously to the judgment for the last of the founder who was put to court, since Umar Patek had to be firmly shot.
Patek, who was almost ten years away as one of the most sought Southeast Asian people, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in the construction of explosives for the bomb attack yesterday.
He could be released after 15 years of penalty.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A debt was also made in a number of terrorism-related accusations, which included a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on the Holy Night in 2000.
The prosecutor called for a lifelong penalty, even if it could have applied the death penalty for the man who was called the master's bomber because of his reputation as "Demolition Man".
The decision has awakened painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin stewards Jane and Jenny in the desolation caused by Patek and his co-sworns almost ten years ago.
With tears she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"It should be put before a shooting command," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't get any more grandsons and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made like the ground floor, when a huge bomb exploded in a small load that had been parked before the nightclub shortly after 23 o'clock.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide killer exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into coma for a month after the attack and died three times while hanging on a lifekeeping system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same destiny as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the blood bath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before all others.
To let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and wounded many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber who was in court.
He was almost a decade of arrest, but was finally taken up in the Pakistan City of Abbottabad in January 2011, where US forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the negotiation, a FBI agent said that secret service reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet my shop with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He hasn't put himself," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has suffered to others.
The judgment took place before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which will be held with Memorial celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek may still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: passengers can now use electronic devices in planes (but do not give phone calls)
From departure to landing, air travellers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, music and to make a look at movies, but not to call the phone, according to the new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA co-worker Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The airlines must demonstrate the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of air personnel as well as the regulations for disturbance of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA said that it had already received plans from some airlines to develop the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a pronouncement.
At present, passengers need to disable smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They can only start them again until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and gives the captain green light.
When the passengers enter the landing flight, they need to turn off again and do not have to start them again before the plane has landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when starting, landing and rolling field, the FAA stated.
Most of the new aircraft and other aircraft that have been re-equipped for the use of Wi-Fi in larger heights should comply with the criteria.
Laura Glading, the president of the professional air crew association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
We are honestly sorry to feel like supervisors on this subject.
Nevertheless, Internet connections to surf, exchange of e-mails, text messages or download of data under three kilometres continued to be prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble-like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 played on his smartphone, when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines, because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the airport.
And more heavy devices like laptops must continue to be disturbed, as there is a risk of injuries here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile calls during the flight remain prohibited.
Regulatory competence for telephone calls is at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAA may prohibit certain electronic devices when starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said of the National Transportation Safety Board, safety experts for national transport issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
“Mobile is really a problem, not just because they could cause potential disturbances in navigational devices, but because we know about the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt broadcasting masts”, says Rosenker.
A consultative committee of the industry, which was launched by the FAA for the examination of this issue, recommended last month that the government permits a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics such as democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly severe because the use of the devices has become widely present.
In some studies it is mentioned that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore the switching off of the device.
In 1966, the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by passengers have become known to the UKW radius that was the latest technic trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interferences do not matter.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the flight height is reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices according to the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only give minimum radiation when you surf.
However, when downloading or sending data, transfer values are stronger.
Among the defenders of a loosening of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but they could not detect.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of use of devices.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the disturbance of the devices was real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only separate reports from pilots talking about a disturbance of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange the disconnection of the devices by passengers in the event of instrument landing under bad view conditions.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who were now extensively equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Reopened by air rescue service from North Sea Bohr Island of Saved Bird
A bird flying by air rescue service on the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea Bohr Island, was released into nature again.
The water shelves were flyed last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where she was poured up by the Scottish Animal Protection Organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water shelter was probably a winter train bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help."
In her release, the water reels were fit and healthy.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide for prosperity and work in Great Britain want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 managers from the economy, which are in the sizes, sectors and regions of the UK.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow, while the countries stagnate in the EU.
They wish that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil should be favoured from the government side, instead of stopping with the long and effortful process to reform the obscure EU institutions.
The majority of the economic leaders consider that the control of these key competences should be recovered back to Westminster, according to their views on certain legally regulated topics – from cartel law to product law.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, as companies say that the costs of Brussels rules would now exceed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone – even 40 percent of the large companies agreed to the most traditionally Europeanly friendly ones.
Finally, and that is most likely to say, our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pressing for a 'sensitive change' which brings the headquarters of action back to Britain.
It is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion in favour of the remaining in the EU in a Volksabstimmung at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the renewal of British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relationships back to Great Britain from a renewal.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the Eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means a stronger focus on businesses and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gasarya
The start of the South-Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria is one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom Board.
"The present event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the Chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is aimed at creating more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its pendants in Ukraine, where the majority of the Russian gas for Europe is stored, ensures an increased risk for conventional routes, as it is officially heard.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" disabled.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at beneficiary prices when the whole project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinated countries should begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors there is no way past the real estate location of Germany.
The economic framework data are voting, and the financing opportunities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange period.
The German real estate markets benefit from economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in the European comparison.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle pointed out on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
According to Ulbrich, as German commercial real estates were sought show the view of the transaction volume.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous section of the year.
In the UK, the plus was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Immobily investments offer attractive interest," said Ulbrich.
The return balance between real estate and federal bonds was at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA coworkers against accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offenders
Two YMCA coworkers from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual offences in connection with children before, in 2011, accusations were raised against childcare Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Committee for Sexual Molesting of Children learned.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the YMCA had declared that “in the organization one had never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse”.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which an YMCA employee had been accused of child pornography, and another one in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been sentenced in 1991 because of the abuse of him entrusted children.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer assisted by the Commission, that he knew of the first case, but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the opening declaration of the YMCA to the Commission had also been unacceptable in the allegation that "the YMCA had given external verifications in which the YMCA was recognised as at the top front of child security".
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, admitted that the management had failed “from me downwards” in the Lord's attitude and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child security.
Lord was sentenced to the YMCA during his two-year activity for sexual abuse of twelve boys in the beginning of the year.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare argued that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that has prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The employees said that they had observed infringements, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, cared for her privately as a babysitter, let her sit on his shot, said to one that he loved it, and let children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor Lord was and who had asked for training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service director Jacqui Barnat, who was the supervisor of the YMCA Caringbah Lords, “was very intimidating and most of the time very intimidable.”
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have trusted to pay their officer's notice.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgments, so they had not reported him.
Hare explained that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to be drawn from the "Jonathan-Lord intermediate case" concerns "not reporting" by employees, and the board agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to impose the employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the accusations appeared had been made by the managing director of the child services of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent the contamination of evidence, but what had been "overbound" and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW had not been a safe organisation for children in the period between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, said the Commission.
He explained that there were "erntal problems" in the attitude, review, processing, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was suspended until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his exclusion from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided expressing himself on British policy, and his comments are usually limited to foreign policy and its role as an apostle of the Quartet of Peace Stichters in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the office of the Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: “Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this happens, so ...”
When the horsesaw experts found themselves in crowds in Cardiff to shorten the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was ahead.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and did not take his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee drove loose through the three rounds and took the first prize – with 30 adult opponents left behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate maid in a freaking angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural capabilities in dealing with the pony that lie far beyond his age.
And Toffee received bestnotes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced with Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and toffee are a great team.”
They had to attack the entire participants field and have gone from the place with gold pocals and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all enthusiastic when he won.
Full strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was electrified and everyone fired and clapped it.”
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and farmhouses and has two chickens he cares for.
As he's started, it's not gonna take long until he's on the "Pferd of the Year" shoe – and I'm sure he's going to cut off well.
One speaker of the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
They're a great team together.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten and presented in the presentation ring.
They take care of good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fenton's sweet clothing has contributed their part, that really fitted perfectly to the occasion.

A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been accused of discrimination, should be reformed on the front page, said a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fake reports about a national company.
The New Express was now subjected to a 'sumptuous rectification', said the regulatory authority.
The "Reclamation Regulation" was issued by the Governing Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express, which belongs to Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports on the company Zoomlion listed.
"The editorial management of the New Express was irrordinated," the regulatory authority announced in a declaration.
She said that one had decided to “hang a administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license.”
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to perform a complete rectification of the New Express and has recommended to identify the relevant Responsibles with the New Express and to review the new Express leadership team immediately.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and was behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared in the public television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the whole news industry and their ability to gain public confidence," he said to the CCTV State News station.
I did it primarily because I was on money and fame.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chen's excuse, the New Express published an excuse on the front page and explained that you have failed to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made notices on television.
Experts say that consents are still being routinely forced, despite a law change at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical rail operation, was now discovered.
The US authorities describe the 120 times 90 centimetres measuring tunnel as one of the most exhausted passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of nearly six football fields, combines warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless unlikely storage halls in the area, which makes it easier to hide with drugs loaded trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could not be transported in it, the authorities explained.
In discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They threaten in a debt sentence between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers put on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which puts the drug cards to the challenge of bringing their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found an almost 640 metres long passage with rails, leaving from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed himself for separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Courric, who should be emitted on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope it".
Kerr and he still loved themselves, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, in 2011 her son Flynn was born.
According to Lexika, vegetarism is subject to vegetarism, but it differs considerably from it.
For while vegetarians allow the consumption of sahnetortes, ice or a strong Edamer, these sleeves are not on the menu of a Veganer.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the absence of meat and fish, the Veganer leaves off from all consumption of animal products - also honey is neglected.
What remains, you may ask yourself, but when you take a closer look at the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a significant invasion.
"British highlights are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, who provides a variety of special products for Veganers.
Reuben Proctor also enjoys visiting the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealand has been living vegan, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "1997 I turned my diet and became vegetarian."
At the turn of the century the next step took place and I became Veganer.
"The conviction, however, came not only because of nutrition, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers normal leather.
He realized that there are also other everyday interests without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor expresses the maximise of the Veganers, which extends to all consumer behavior.
The Veganer quickly discovered entirely new products, and the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan is not abandoned, but ascesis is an enrichment." The assumption that you reduce the selection of food options with the diet, Proctor leads back to the power of the habit.
And precisely these conditions failed some of the attempts that were still so well meant.
"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," says Proctor.
And turns in: "Certain tastes are not to be stuck in the animal."
Often they are the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"You can also create the same effect in another way," explains the Veganer.
At a barbecue festival, for example, Proctor brings Auberginen, Champignons and a few vegan sausages.
He cares for a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste delicately.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste, but this is not just to reduce on animal food," says Proctor.
He has not suffered health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes that only feed vegan.
"My blood values are best, I often let myself check," says Proctor.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics are warned against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Because animals are nourished with feed instead of grassing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat that is purchased in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 share is high," says Proctor.
For Veganers there is also the possibility to take the coenzym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are all right," he explains.
A wide range of ways do not have to go proctors for food procurement.
Base food is finally available everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
All I need is where I can find.
Only occasionally buy something special.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but so it is also known for "normal" finished products".
However, the preparation of vegan dishes is far more favourable and less time-consuming than generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is much to discover, with a few small knifes you can achieve good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of eggs, with its vegan cheese cubits, Proctor was also able to surprise his sweaters.
Family festivals give the Veganer a new sword.
This has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, skepticism has already been brought to him.
Don't you taste my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions you have to act as a Veganer with a fingertip feeling.
"I don't dismiss people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to eat an enclave.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not appear as vegan-friended as suspected - and the veganist does not seem as restricted in everyday life as generally accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
Damns are everywhere!
"Many dune shops offer Falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he turns out pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, everything a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slowly on it.
"When I started feeding me vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealand countries can find a development: "You have to talk to the people to make them aware of it."
"If enough demands come, they may be inclined to complement the menu," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants are developing, such as the combustion in Mannheim or the café bird-free.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
In fact, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat it, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusively.
"Flesh dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, Veganism is a safe way to make the largest part of the front impossible," says Proctor.
But the purchasing of vegan products could be a little difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand that animal additives can also be contained in peanuts as colourers, it seems that with the follow-up of ethics in so many barriers and traps you quickly leave the courage.
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also cleaning agents.
"After and after, you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to watch "It's sometimes better to do small steps than to stay standing or stumbling," knows Proctor.
Veganism, he is an important moral fingertip that is lying on consciousness.
Perhaps he does not make it possible for one to reject his habits, but at least he can teach the consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to breathe its customers.
The trade at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator made technical problems responsible.
The other 11 US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans at the stock exchange operator.
It was only on Tuesday that the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour for errors in data transport.
In August this year there were two pans alone in one week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent largely faulty purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
Then the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to view and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the whole share trading in the USA came to be made for several hours because of a computer pan at the Nasdaq stock market.
In addition, last year, Facebook's purchasing course had been provided for attention.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown to the flood of purchase and sale orders, later the SEC Exchange Supervisor established and killed the company to a record penalty of $10 million.
Constance: Radlers drive 63-year-olds around
In the case of the accident, according to the police, a 26-year-old man was on Thursday night, at 22 o'clock, on the left walk from the station to the market place with a lady bike unruly.
Suddenly, when a 63 - year - old man walked from a local road, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to the police.
At the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and moved a 15-inch long burial wall on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to medical treatment to the hospital.
British Police, Assange, provides a statement of delivery
Today, the British police handed a statement of delivery to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the ecuadorian Embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had a "requirement to stand" that asked him to appear in a police guard, and added, he should not follow it, threatened him.
Assange threatens the delivery to Sweden because of the claim in a sexual offence after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to the delivery at the beginning of the month.
He feared that Stockholm would deliver him to the US, and on 19 June he had sought refuge in the ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard called on a 40-year-old man to put himself at a time we chose to a police guard," said one spokesman.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on deposit.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears that he was delivered from Sweden to the United States and accused of possible spying accusations there after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on WikiLeak's release website.
The driver, who was frozen with 210 km/h and hot drink between the legs, receives 1,000 pounds of penalty
A driver was imposed a penalty of £1,000 because he had traveled with up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the beverage cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester Court, Howie announced himself guilty, without having driven the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs of £90 as well as a victim allowance of £100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has foreseen calculating the CGT measures but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a stamp tax of 7% in 2012 on apartments that cost over two million pounds as well as annual fees for buyers, holding homes as a company and not as individuals.
The revenue from the stamp tax for residential property in the districts Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which were in the 2012/13 tax year at 708 million pounds, summarized the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp tax on high-price apartments and the introduction of the legislation related to this approach, one can hardly claim that high-quality real estate is too low, regardless of the effects of the obsolete community tax system.”
"But this step could make some foreign investors more deprived of the purchase of real estate in London or prevent owners from selling it," he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the apartment market by price – in the wealthy London Southwest Gortel, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has deferred the record value of 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed an equal annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an ascending 'inland market' where the southwest part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, such as Savills.
Scientists have been able to give more light on the context of a dog’s tailwedles with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail weared more to the right (from the dog’s sight), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: “The human being is well known that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli that produces positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side of their pants, the researchers monitored the animals while these movies looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves into the one, once in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate other aspects, and so we could control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw a otherwise printless dog moving the tail to the right (looking from the perspective of the boring dog), they remained completely relaxed.
However, the tail humiliation was primarily left (more from the perspective of the dog, who wears), so their heart rate rose and they looked calm.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience in which movements they should worry and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and wedling with the tail in one direction is more linked to friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to improve the understanding of the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Medicine at the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study in which it was examined whether to the left and right of the dogs important.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was: “Dollars go to a robot dog when his ‘Switz’ turns to the left and not to the right, instead of getting calm – exactly otherwise than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore be that the dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs in the various studies.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“There are significant evidence for many different mammals that the two halfs of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
But because their behavior is easy to record, it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
On February 22, Pope Francis was called for the first time to call new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergymen in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached 80 years of age can no longer participate in the Pope election – that is the case with a group of 120 “optional cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals, which was also known as a concertary.
"Papst Franziskus has decided to announce his decision to initiate the concession in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinal elevated cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He explained that a pope usually recognizes as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of cardinals that are elevated is 120 again, and as many cardinals as he wants over 80.
The concession in the next year is important because it is the first since the election of Franziskus in March this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a certain coverage on the side of Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will design cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Cardinals Council founded by Franziskus, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the commission to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Franziskus has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was “good” that Franziskus would ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we were not in this situation – that's all very new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would call cardinals, but Franziskus “fouled with surprises – so we don’t know who he is appointed.”
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA for repair of the seat lounge
General Motors call back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup Trucks with the 2014 construction year to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat lone, such as a communication from the U.S. regulator for vehicle safety on Friday.
For some of the cars, there can be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety at head supports.
“If the head support is driven from behind to the vehicle, it is possible that the head support does not properly protect the inmates so that there is an increased risk of injuriousness”, the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website read.
The revoked models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM-Trucks began in June and is the main model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the vehicle in the first half of October about the defect.
Due to the 16-day government shutdowns, NHTSA could not check the notification letter, which affected car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, had increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM explained on Friday.
In October GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup-Trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 percent to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon at the New York Stock Exchange.
Distortion of a Obama Selector
I voted President Obama twice in the hope that change would be possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts which have been defeated by the blockadectics of the Republicans
Blockade policy does not apologize to the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's Memoirs on the 2008 election struggle would be a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I'm reading a terrible sad book now.
It's a book I believed that it would bring me up during the dreadful second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (to win) and describes the Memoirs Barack Obamas as the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm finished with my patient descriptives in the evening and go to bed, then the book leads me back to a time when politics inspired millions and robbed a speech of breath.
The election was made to a earth-sliding victory and news speakers kept in mind the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
At that time, Obama changed to office in 2008, he had 82% of the consent values.
And then I closed the book.
Turning back to the present is a bad awakening, as if you are shredsed out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I gave my voice for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military deduction from Iraq, the end of the forced vagueness of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the party-political blockadectics have fought too many efforts that our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name only a few.
But after many times I defended the Obama government against colleagues and acquaintances, I came to the end with my statement attempts.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to listen to foreign heads of state or kill innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished, reveals state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, has been murdered without procedures, and why the public financing and expenditure limits are being transposed during the presidency elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, which says that the White House's efforts to rest the media are the 'aggressivest... since Nixon's government.
And recently, it cannot apologize the inability to create a simple website during the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns it has preceded.
Obviously, the Office of Members is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown Embassy present the public discussion.
But if I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that's most disturbing me.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidateship.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unequivocal alternative that he seemed to be unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard for so long.
But with the cutting of the consent values for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return in 2008 has become so harder by this book.
It awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have resolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting with the Electors after the decision, he told his employees that they would have to come back on course and follow the purpose of their business.
“I want us to find our magician again," he said.
We have to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
Milliardary and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, which is in a judicial dispute about the payment of $6 million to CO2 taxes, raised the claim when he wanted to take questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and would personally benefit the daughters of Abbott from the laws.
"He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission, with 53 votes, officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the process to tell the voice so that it could go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which you enter, enter the data into a computer, select immediately and then get the result at 6:30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the voice plate.
Do you use them because you can then erase the results if they don't like you?
Nowadays, it is incredible to align with pencils.
The Election Commission has examined the options for electronic choice and has recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy was an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very serious".
A public office is a public service.
"We are not striving for any reward except for the history, that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their foreign exchange department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide authorities' investigation of the suspected manipulations on the monetary market is rapidly driving.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the investigations in the world's largest financial market, where 5.3 billion US dollars change the owner every day.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the expanding investigation that led to the scandal around the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation related persons indicated that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and was supposed to have been certified by his current position as European head of Forex Spot Handling at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was awarded this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were accused of any misconduct.
The Instant Message Group of Usher included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation close to them.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had explained that she had examined a suspected manipulation of the exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with accusations that bankers should have dealt with in transactions on the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks pass instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has put the dealers into a riot area that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year, because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and high degree liquid exchange market, but leading dealers believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks would lead to “one can already influence the market with very low ticket prices”.
The message came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had canceled a dealer of their London Exchange Traded Fund Office this week after he had caused a loss of almost six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is covered," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the Bauzaun on the Bechtle base
A group of the civilian initiative "Swiss Wiese" has delighted the Bauzaun at the Bechtle base at the Kurpromenade in Badenalb.
In addition, she was cleaning and spreading the footway, it is said in a press release.
The planned coverage of the decaying house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons, because the ground is threatened to shake off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had rejected the enchanting action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent message "We have been made for it".
However, this disturbed the about 20 members of the citizens' initiative little in their action.
Her motto on the big poster called "We are against building ruins".
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - one day the giant project should fail.
In the discussion with many passengers before the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city's project would improve many, although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city further delays these answers, it says from the side of the BI.
As was heard, the public statements of the mayor also affect.
In May at the municipal council meeting, he had said that he was afraid of the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss Wiese.
For this reason, some seem too scared, others feel them as a "plumped attempt to oppress" on the population, continues in the press release of BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick skeleton for Schiris: Mane no swine king
Even though Ralf Rangnick is satisfied with the current high-form of Bundesliga table guide Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bull" was disappointed by the arbitrators.
"There is a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are pushed into the category of sulphur kings," he took the two offensivewirbles in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
Last occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegalean became a alleged activist - which was obviously no one, as the TV pictures showed.
"A crack of misdecision," said Rangnick, who called arbitrator Harkam as "too much obsolete".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
His German Landsmann defended him: "I would have acted like Roger Schmidt in every situation."
Schmidt himself wants no contact with his colleague after the Scharmützel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"When I am the one who was offended," stressed the 46-year-old.
In view of the success, Rangnick agreed a praise symn.
"For this there are only two words: right well," he found.
There isn't much to be suspended.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's gonna go on so quietly.
Border changes in winter transfer time will hardly exist.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Apart from a player approaches the desire to leave the club," Ranknick stated.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: the U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the closely associated health law with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to conclude health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional in the context of the State's tax authority.
The chief judge John Roberts struck on the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided on the other hand.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of comprehensive law and also held the view that the requirements of the health law, which state states would either need to extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise eliminate all State Medicaid claims, would not be unconstitutionally restricting.
The action procedure against the law was enforced by 26 federal states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidency candidates, including the final issuer Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian site makes light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low level of sunset, the Rjukan in Vestfjord valley usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters of height, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Endly!", mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the start ceremony in TV2.
Some of the valley dwellers had sunshine, others set up safety for sunshine.
So far, sunshine had to go to a close peak with a cable track in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
This basic idea, however, has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about EUR 615 000) expensive project.
For some years a similar construction has been offering winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella.
Post is hardly empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will have not yet noticed that the red points for the Sunday clearance are still on various core town and city parts, but if you read the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that the emptying of sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP notes.
A request from the FDP has confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the postal building in the Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in the Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is also cleared on Sunday, the answer to the FDP's request is not answered.
The social and youth-political spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow here.
The Sunday emptying is a major postal service at the time of appointment.
"This company thins out radically and unreasonable despite the price increase for letters on January 2013."
Thomas Bittner, President of the Liberal Group and City Associations, supports his colleagues: "What is angry with me is the fact that the clearing times are changed or deleted here in secret".
The post is miles away from the nearest of the citizens.
"At least, the boxes in the districts of Neusschloss and Rosengarten must be cleared again on Sunday," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Even for the core town, especially mobile fellow citizens would have to reach a letter box with Sunday emptiness.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans to talk to the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier answered that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, is also a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken for privatizations.
"Then decisions are taken elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt Parking fees are to increase strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be more sensitive.
The city's Magistrate advises this morning about a presentation of traffic dezernist Stefan Majer (Greene).
Accordingly, parking charges are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, the price should not be raised, but the time interval of parking clocks and parking cars should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Ordering Assembly has to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers it "not for a good idea".
The possibility of parking immediately before the business is "a non-administrative advantage for smaller traders".
The German transport club believes that an increase after two decades is "perhaps appropriate and actually overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions overlap hosts
With a narrow frame, the Lords I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to arrive at the Schiller School Hall in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb.
The Elblers stood with an experienced team on the other side of the network.
Soon, however, it proved that she could not be entirely able to carry out with the fast actions of the joy cities.
With the hard and placement clashes, the Gönningers were extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the network center and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all interests.
In view of this oppressive and game-consistent performance, the third sentence was won a little tired and unfortunately for the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to work out in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B class, the second teams from Baierssbronn and the city of joy were located in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fighted two-hour hit.
Nervosity on both sides caused errors and scores, especially when baling; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes deficiency and in some critical game scenes, the overily prevented the view of possible points gains.
In this highly balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team consistently voted in the great physical use and a happy commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English cottage
On the Fifth Day of Care in the Following of the Natura 2000 Project of Upper Hotzenwald, a group of engaged participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach.
On the basis of suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the hut the view into the valley should be cut free, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, so Emperor, called this area as the shiny piece of the gorgeous slope, on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for magnificent views.
He thanked the attendant for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the nursing day was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection of humanity and nature.
He offered every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, the ecological consideration could also be found.
This ecological aspect explains Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Protection of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the Schirmherrhood and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view covers the aim of maintaining the old allmend garden with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grass coppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to maintain art.
Tribukait said she didn't want to miss it at this point to break a lanze for the planned biosphere area.
In this plan, the current measure is not only seamless.
A biosphere area also offers the chance of sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of internationally recognised unesco status and thus a continuous supplement to the future achieved with the life project and the previous care days.
Following these different presentations, Head of Representatives Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helpers in groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forest sleeves would be ready to call.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of waxers and the care of a dry stone bar.
The objective was the free view at the point of view.
Löffingen: Heads still a single candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future-oriented school, children's, youth and senior policy, as well as its own city works can be called attractive city, no second Mayor candidate has yet been reported.
The only candidate for the succession of the old-age mayor Norbert Brugger has been the 46-year-old bank merchant and business owner Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application period runs on Monday, 11 November, at 18 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei accused for Nortel-Patenten
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, stricted on Thursday a lawn of claims for patent violation of cell phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was offered by Nortel during the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that the Nortel patents bought for 4.5 billion US dollars, accused Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the community of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents involved technology which brings search terms into line with relevant advertising on the Internet, so the action that meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google's operating system Android, which stands in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google gave an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google increased his offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After it was offered at Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google Motorola Mobility purchased $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated by Motorola's library to patents.
“Although Google failed with his attempt to acquire the complaint patent at the auction, Google violated the patents and continues to do so," the complaint writes.
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google, as it claims that Google's patent violation is intentionally, so the accusation.
Egypt defends first freely elected presidents
Mohammed Mursi delegates the office oath, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was defended as the first elected president of the country and thus attacked the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been displaced from the office 16 months earlier.
With its office in front of the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth Head of State since the fall of monarchy about 60 years ago.
He put the oath in front of the 18 black robes dressed judges of the court, which has its seat on the Nile and has been reaped to an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," said Mursi at the festive ceremony that was transferred live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an educated engineer and a Muslim brotherhood member in the USA, a fundamentalist group, who was mostly taken into sight since its founding 84 years ago as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoi shortly after eleven o'clock.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to excite the new president, and, unlike the presidial sprinkle from Mubarak time, traffic was stopped only in a short time so that the car convoi could cross the usually busy road that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “the replacement wheel” of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he not only presented himself as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to address the efforts of the 2011 rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red crowns, to judges in the wooden chamber in which he placed the oath of office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to hold his approach speech.
He was officially welcomed by a army chapel who played the national hymn that he listened to in Habacht.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants in the largest hearing hall of the university with speaking of "The Army and the People are a hand".
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a basement of secular education, has developed into a high-level Islamist student group in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi put a symbolic oath on the Tahir site, the birthplace of the rebellion, which last year led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he commended to call back presidial powers that the military council had taken over from the office.
But with the dismissal of the official oath before the court, and not as usual before Parliament, he bows himself to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic popular gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season started at the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet".
Today's Friday evening it's called "Pump this party", on tomorrow's Saturday evening it's going to be with a 25-quo.
Of course, fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed by ladder: severely injured
During the exchange of a defected external feeler, on Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder and fell seriously.
The man from Lamp Right Houses wanted to exchange a defective heating sensor at the outside façade of a guesthouse.
When he climbed the ladder on the roof rings, it slipped away and the man crashed on the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to Salzburg with the rescue shelfer "Christophorus 6".
Rape forces in South Africa: two times lifelong imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice life-long on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC broadcaster.
The victim died later from the consequences of severe injuries.
John Kana had been found guilty at the beginning of the week of crime.
The action had triggered distress throughout the country.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for the survival of the victim but failed.
The youth's sight was so disgusting that the nurses and sisters needed psychological support.
Kana had admitted during the process to have been in a bar in the Tatnight with Booysen.
He also confessed to be beat and raped, but he contends to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had first taken away from several offenders but left two suspects out of prison because the evidence against them did not suffice.
The prosecutor also stressed during the procedure that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa rapes are almost everyday: there are about 64 000 advertisements for sexual violence annually.
These are almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, they have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa appreciate the dark figures in sexual violence but the 10- to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest
Jumbo looking for the "best ham of the world": The Pro7 Star Bonndorf visited for the TV broadcast "Galileo".
The speaker makes it clear at the beginning: the most important for the ham are the pig cows, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the operation of the "Adler" company in Bonndorf.
"Germany lovely ham," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes into the inside of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he can grab the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening fast imbiss in Waldshut
"Here I'm being worked with roasty quantities," the television makers, black forests shin as a mass product.
16.000 cereals a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat, color: Uli explains what the quality is about.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"There I am excited when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then," says Jumbo cynical.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is worth it anyway.
The spectator sees that the breakdown of the cubes is still hand-working.
For: Black forests shining is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoking Tower and Smoking Fire reminds Jumbo visually of a "U boat".
The trick: Dance branches here in smoke provide the special taste of the Black Forest shining.
20 days in smoke, the ham finally makes almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the Jumbo," he announced the test food.
"It's really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will allow all stakeholders to live.
You thought travel offices belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects records from vacationers in Australia and Great Britain.
The travelling company is now going out of an adjusted annual profit before taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared with $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are achieved, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As managing director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre gained eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been beneficial and some of them are in good direction towards record year revenues before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically one of our strongest results.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, which was a slightly weaker market for business trips.
It was similarly good for Flight Centre's leisure business in Great Britain, while the business customers also spend less.
The U.S. business recovered from the seasonal condition of weaker first half of the year, so that a profit for the third year is expected as a result of the year as a whole.
The shares of Flight Centre rose by 3 cents to $38.20 last night.
Schools are stopped to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses of English literature, students will need to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The test also includes 'unseeked texts' in order to encourage a broader reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, pupils have to take a separate GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new teaching plans for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other core areas will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Supervisory Authority for Tests, will announce a new organisation of the GCSE structures, including a new notation system and less course work.
In a summer speech, Minister of Education, Michael Gove said that there is a “great consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence” and stressed that the GCSEs would become“ more demanding, ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent for mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week each year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours each year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hour schedule, coalition circles say that the comprehensive mathematics examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the art in ranking lists – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours.
In the curriculum, more attention is given to 'problems of the right life', including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious caves lock
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and colors present the circulation performance view this weekend in the citizens' house.
The reviews have already been made on Thursday
Once again, the W514 village association is setting up this great exhibition.
Farmers from the Soest circle show their best animals here, as well as young Wickeder Hobbyholders.
On Thursday, six prize judges made an assessment of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the ecumenical Forum
At the next ecumenical Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle, it is about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological considerations for today's dealing with the last things".
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The ecumenical talk forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical church communities of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to examine in the forum of the question, as today people are curling the "last things" after death.
If humans had known too much of it in the past centuries and had put it on those pictures of heaven and hell, "who are making our ideas to this day," the contemporary prophetic teaching of hopes for completion is rather reflected by some embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out by the religious criticism," says the referendum.
She has "provided us with so many question marks that the call signs seem to have come off us".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the anger of death."
This is the question of that desire, "which dreams of being good at the end".
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She studied Dr. theol in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms University.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has been a chair for systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislings: More than 100 young Catholics of the Little Heuberg confirm their confession of faith in firming
In two services, 101-15- and 16-year-old youths of the seed care unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been approved.
In the morning, the Laudato-Si group accompanied the service of the youth chor The Spirit.
With the reception of the firm sacrament, the youths said yes to their baptism and asked the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firms had prepared themselves in the past months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the assistance of many municipal members for the great festival.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and experienced the youth day in Submachtal together.
Ilvolene: Second Mountainbike race enthusiastic participants
At magnificent weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the round course across the hill chains around the lake.
This informs Ulrich Knobel of the organising sports club Ilvole.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres, were also numerous everyone's wheelchairs who once wanted to perform their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
These two were expected to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time to the destination and defended his title as a total winner of the short-distance.
On place two, Pascal Treubel was again placed.
Theresa Duelli was with the ladies from the team of the nightmare that managed it to the top of the victory.
On the square two and three Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leone drivers from Owingen.
A delightful development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the municipality.
Not only was the whole range of athletes represented as regards performance.
The age structure also ranged from ten years in the youngest to over 70 years with the oldest starters.
In the main race this year, more absolute topathlets were started.
Four drivers were able to depart from the regional top drivers.
Among these are Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-profi from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was already two times world champion at 12 hours.
This year he became a European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German titles in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of height, there was a wimpernschlag final in the target run in front of the three lake hall.
Pangerl was the first to rush over the target line.
Only a second behind it the Routinier Ballerstedt could secure the second place in the overall evaluation.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as a third of the overall evaluation.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place, Areane Blersch was secured from Binzwangen before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well-organized expiry of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George’s Bwelle saw how his ill father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and caused a haematom that should impair him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overfilled hospitals and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," commented Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and it's not the first one.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has barely changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for each 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 persons.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Camerooners could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of health spending in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his landmen suffered in Bwelle made it mature to do something about it.
Dr. George's Bwelle and his volunteer team have performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor and worked as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, travelling in rural areas on weekends and offering free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people are in small buses and riding with the scarced medical equipment on the roof over unmounted terrain into the villages that need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
For more than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebration and bwelling – with its broad smile and its unlimited energy – is enjoyed at the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team then starts investigating hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per ride," says Bwelle.
They come from an area of 60 kilometres around the village – and that is on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive chickens, donated brilliants or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school, but many poor families can simply not afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local fraud.
Operations usually take place in a school, the Town Hall or an apartment; after the intervention, the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The illumination for the OP and the disinfection equipment is eaten by the generator of the group and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning on Sunday.
It is an effortful pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“They drum the whole night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team then goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon physicians and foreign medical students – last year has performed 700 free operations and knows that with her work it makes a huge difference for the people to help them.
One man explained that the free operation of a breach that he received now enables him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest came from private donations.
"I really don't know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medical in the second year and willingly participate in Bwelles Group.
He's always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to collect practical experiences they would never get at home.
“We can be in surgery where we help to drop blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated sanity material.
But once in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and guidance.
"He is no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life of this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to a happier life and thus fulfill a promise he has given to his Father makes him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm gonna make it to bring people back to laughter and to illuminate the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novelle "The old man and the sea", is cut on the body.
Janson himself is an old hate in his metier, the art of acting.
The old man Santiago can't pretend to fish.
So the two simply complement themselves greatly.
They almost mean to see the folds in the neck of the old man, of whom the fishermen's boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is tired of life bent on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his will strength.
Janson is on a wide range of routes as a single performer on the stage.
He is able to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologians are no moment boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he sets the active scene in the light: The hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor, who sings Cuba’s feeling of life with its songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Kubas rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: Departure to the Romans
A wastewater channel from the Roman era is received below Cologne at about 120 metres long.
Those who visit Cologne don't come by the cathedral.
Around 157 meters, the two towers slope into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigrane turtles knew that there is a lot to discover even under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
Meeting point for his tours is the service center of Cologne Tourism directly at the Dome.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city’s fathers wanted an auto-just city, so from the rest of the old city walls, only what was not too big.
Most of the users of the parkhouse are therefore hurrying by the Roman remains today and only turning off their cars.
But whoever looks more closely, finds an archaeological archaeological site separated by metal slides in the D2 Park Deck.
There are about five meters of high ruins made of handteller-size stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze leaves the participants on the top of the park plane to take a look into a dark, 15 meters deep box.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is hardly perceived.
Next station of the tour is the precinct, and here the participants get down into the depth.
We experience the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinsium", which in good German means as much as "City of Roman Rights and City of Agrippins, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for Imperial Cult".
And the presidency is the former Governor Palace, the center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman wastewater channel, which is preserved here at about 120 metres long.
"You can quietly pass a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," coined Schulze the guests.
A surprise still has schools.
After he picked the key at the box, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, handy box.
"We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bathroom," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bathroom deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for the ritual washings.
Until today, at the bottom of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels can be discerned by changing peaks of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall for which the construction work should begin in short.
But until completion, there will be a few years.
Almost hacked leg: relay of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is re-rolled after more than four years.
A process of attempting deaths, dangerous body injury and damage against two 30-year-olds has begun in front of the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The accused were silent.
They were supposed to have been active in the rockers scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecutor suggests that in June 2009, together with unknown complicities in Finowfurt, they have poured into a car on three men.
All victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims were supposed to have heard of the competing group of Hell's Angels.
One should have been a high-level member from Berlin.
It seemed that a persecution hunt with several cars had gone ahead.
According to the accusation, it was about territorial struggles and a demonstration of power.
The two accused had been released in a first procedure in early 2012.
A judiciary then said that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feather.
The perpetrators wore masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof raised the judgment after revision of the prosecutor and rejected it for the renewal of proceedings to the Landgericht.
One of the accused is currently in the open execution because of another offence.
It was mainly about the reconstruction of the runways in Tatnight.
As a witness, the Commissioner was invited to find out at that time.
In the center, phone calls were held by the accused and other people who had listened to the police.
It's difficult that Rocker in court almost always keeps himself up to a rather law for her, and not to say.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been packed out.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Prosecutor (Oder) said on demand that new traces have appeared since the last procedure.
For the process, eleven further negotiation days are set.
The disposal company does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but some time it goes home.
Only: In the baths of people on the rider and back seat, the hunger is noticeable.
Surely, some cocktail or sect may be responsible for that!
What is closer than chilling to go to the next drive-in to give yourself a small thing?
I admit, I'm glad to go to the fast food holes late night or early morning.
A few pommes, a cola, a Burger - and then nothing like home and bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco guests are noticeable.
Because what must be missing from the car window with steady regularity throwing his fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially during the weekends are discarded paper bags on road edges and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are the people too deaf to take the bags with home respective to the next trash?
It's not just like the paper crew scatters the landscape.
Suits have also covered transport facilities such as guiding planks and thus triggered accidents.
About this, however, wasn't meant "away society", she probably doesn't even know what this word actually means.
When you're on the way in the evening, only with several people in the car, you know how a backbank can look for through-feated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage towers there.
There would be a few bags more or less, but they wouldn't matter - in contrast to the road where no one wants to trawle on the food remains of others.
I already see the day when the cities and municipalities are going to bleed away - and the fast food chains must demand for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal in health policy
After severe criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday with his frequently repeated, clear promise: "If your health insurance pleases you, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of their insurer received a notice of cancellation, the Republicans threw the president in the last days, he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relatived his original promise.
"The majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the cancellations, Obama asked the Americans who received such communications to look after a new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens could receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more favourable than predicted.
"They come a better offer," he said.
The government described it as little as surprising that the five percent of the people who have made a insurance would have to look after another rate, since their contract did not comply with the new standards according to the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans that they deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Representative House in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the start of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
"I am just as frustrated and angry as all others," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This pronunciation of a sebelius to a seated consultant at the yesterday hearing at the House of Representatives was received after an interview with the Republican Ms. Billy Long from Missouri. It was the question of whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly threatened with the question why the “architecture” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refuse to a State-supported insurance to conclude a price at HealthCare.gov, which it now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Support
A U.S. government officer who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighters had attacked an air-arm support point in the Syrian Latakia one day before.
The goal was "Rakets and related equipment" which the Israeli government feared that they were intended for the Lebanese Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the support point in the port city of Latakia had been shot in the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis had been responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, on which Russian defensive missiles of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles were seen, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilometres.
Insecure The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters News Agency also quotes an anonymous Israeli government official with the words that he believes that Israel has executed the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman of the Israeli Ministry of Defense said, "We don't comment on these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver ground air missiles to the Hisbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that every attempt by Syria to supply the Hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the crossing of a "red line", which would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented consent that the US spionage was "inappropriately gone too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected consent, demonstrated a disproportionateness of the US's defensive attitude in terms of their monitoring programmes by saying that spying was "inappropriately too far".
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, deceived the responsibility for being put on the "Autopilot" when the explosive revealings of Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the spying activities of the NSA.
Through the transmitted information, the US government has been driven into a diplomatic storm of disarmament from its allies.
In a video-connected speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “The President and I, as well as others in the government, have experienced some things that have expired by autopilot, simply because the ability was to do what was still to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course to 11 September.”
He then agreed as the first high-level member of the US government that the US spionage had exceeded a border, but also stressed that no rights had been misused.
He said: “In some cases, this has gone too far.”
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore carry out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process are not affected.
Kerry, however, pointed out that the NSA was a force of good and had been saved many lives through their monitoring processes.
He added: “We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is destined to kill people, to blow into the air and attack governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented airplane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
In the meantime, US legislators will travel to Europe to scatter the concerns against the alleged American spionage and convince the Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in the anti-terrorism efforts, as the president of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terror organisations due to the frustration of monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts to combat terrorism," said Murphy, who is in the Senate as a Democrat for the first time and is chaired by the Senate Subcommittee for Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger on the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US associations, although the secret service director said this week that the reports were ineffective and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by Nato associations and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed by Snowden, which the NSA supervised the cell phone of Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The director of national secret services, James Clapper, defended the spying with allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all this tumult, Murphy said that his authority prepared the journey of the convention to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members are to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route was still being developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "first words".
He said that the European governments would have to be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they themselves have been using for years.
"Though we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also find ourselves with the fact that we are not the only ones who are pioneering," says Murphy.
In the meantime, John Kerry is traveling to the Middle East and to Poland on the weekend to deal with the grief about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.

Mainz bnns for a use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
He has only been able to do this individually.
"We will decide on his use in the short term," said Trainer Thomas Tuchel.

Australian is calling against prison penalty in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15-day prison in Phuket because she falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the judgment and was released on deposit.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty of a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after she had stated to the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning on Sunday, June 10th, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely reached her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they stood to figure out the story.
Until the court trial, she was locally in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison in a low-security prison at the edge of Phukets instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy-Liga, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks said to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely worried" about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have her back to Australia.
“We are of course very worried, but we hope that it will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on a free foot.
In Australian reports, it was read that in the meantime she makes holidays in the resort of Krabi in Southern Thailand.
On the side of the court was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand may be striving to improve his attacked tourist image after the recent murder of Michelle Smith in Phuket, which is why it comes to a free speech.
