Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city
A mistaken institution, where young people are supposed to meet today.
A burial chapel, where is now buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Kleingärtners manage the former cause of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories in days.
It's nervous if maps are not current.
That knows everyone who had to get up, because the Auto-Navi instead of a turning road showed a green grass.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern atlas, a offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the government, are all other than current - but therefore very informative.
Especially when comparing them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a flickententeppich that you do not recognize as such.
For cities and municipalities, more detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were included in the large overview map.
These originated according to the Bavarian measurement administration between 1810 and 1864 and escaped the first measurement of Bayerns.
Your contractor: Napoleon.
The French army leader has occupied Bayern since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bayerns - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbors who created the idea of an area-covering Bayern map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued to drive the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" and thus the Bavarian measurement management.
The original sheet for Munich comes from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The early/day comparison is most impressive in the example of the capital of the country.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
One example of this is Subsendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sending was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a municipality in Munich.
Today, undersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of the subsidiaries concentrate around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing like fields - at first glance: When zooming in a small part map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritingly numbered flur pieces from the so-called "origination", from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels there today no longer prove farmers - but Kleingärtners of the "Land in Sun".
A large green area is located north of Subsendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810, was actually a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original sheet, you can read not only the street name "on the guest egg" or the elevator "on the ventilation" in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen, but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße, people were once invented with angry ideas.
In 1858/59, the Münchner Kreis-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüften" was created.
From 1872 onwards, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the chains of so-called errors.
He also prohibited the personnel from applying violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition on the site.
For 280 patients there was first place, later extended to 500 places.
At some time, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular facility in hair 1905.
Since 2006, there is the Isar Amper Clinicum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The order purchased the building complex in 1920 and converted it to a youth home with training companies.
Westlich is the football square of TSV Munich East, eastern residential homes from the 1980s.
In 2015, the Children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural reference to the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during World War II during bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was a "Hauptplatz" in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change also brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the bombs of the Allies drove many holes into the city center.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval barbecue once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are the pre-works and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn stamstreck.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to the air image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorigen has issued a warning for coloured people traveling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force until August 28, 2017, calls on Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention to traveling through the state and to give extreme caution, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have recently been encountered throughout the state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to win discrimination complaints, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the State that are in proportional to minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have injuries of citizens' rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten together or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during his journey by the State and was kept in custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report of the Missouri General Prosecutor's Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 percent more often than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people must be ready, whether it brings bail or let the relatives know that they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hatred crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting programme, which accommodate the State in respect of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to complain a company about housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profile.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times stakeholders have used the action to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaun project is elementary
Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the next year.
The CDU member Peter White and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on site.
At the courtyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisherbach CDU site association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his business, where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 milk cows and as many young animals and houses in five apartments holiday guests.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternatively unmarketing path for the milk of his cows, said Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes only regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaun project as "elementar important".
I can't profit from such steep areas.
The green area provides a lot of work, much has to be dealt with with the motorsense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and topography," said Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not conduct a organic operation.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the significance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the Leader funding".
In the case of costs from 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this would allow the upgrading of the surfaces to be pulled out for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their business," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were occupied.
The surface is thus 40 hectares, which are not to be extruded by at least 2023.
From the total cost of 71 500 euros, half over Leader was promoted, a quarter of the municipality of Fischerbach.
So farmers remained €12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of Weidezaun.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the tea," said Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job, without farmers and farmwomen.
Peter White also stated: "Here are best food produced."
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of Weidezäunen.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the presence of a supporting scene designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area in which the surface should be inserted should not be slippery (inferior to 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the research.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project in 2018, the request is currently being made by eight participants with 24 parcels that want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The area of public service corresponds to 35 hectares, the cost calculated is more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump takes the stand of freedom
The safest sign of a regime switch is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully-instigated fall of Saddam Husseins at the Firdo's place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axis in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration to the stand of freedom.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty idiots would have aligned him if he had done it.
But he attacked their significance, and in particular the significance attributed to her, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller Acosta said: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the stand of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that lights the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom."
Miller is really right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the rebellious words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tiredness, your poor, / your intimidated masses, who long to breathe freely, / the eager waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "valid waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump's USA were not welcome.
This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a depreciated classical illustration.
Lazarus changed this significance: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a different name: Mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativeism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great cryhal Rush Limbugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the statue of freedom is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the nested world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.
It is intended to carry the Factor of Freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The Factor should not illuminate the way to the United States."
It's pretty unusual that Limaugh's found something here.
The significance of the statue is quite a question of the view of perception.
The great fantasy act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, distressed, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their faces should not illuminate the way, but flamme the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two scotches belonged to the British team
The performance director of the light-athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-country Scottish contingent in the World Championship Framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "in Scotland something special has to be developed" and that the United Kingdom's athletics have to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Light Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are Medaillen lawyers, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will arrive against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 metres route, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as a team captain.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Her captain ride was incredible," says Black.
"A series of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh gave naturally were great."
The Commonwealth-Silver Medaillen winner who will join her fifth world championships at the 400-m hardships says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 scotes are in the British team.
Scotland has so far been the best total number of athletes at the World Championship, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.
The medium-sized runner Muir is taking this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m loops.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another shot to be observed after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls her first world championships when the only other shoot was in the Lee McConnell team.
The team’s captain says that she is "eneriously proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team but in some cases also mixed with the medals and the finals.
"The special thing to be a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes it a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the scotes belonging to the team.
It only shows how far we came.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podies.
What about my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that in this situation we are very happy because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics about Facebook: Do not work for a public office if you cannot treat the heating of electors
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from internal policy to its political principles.
He shook at the criticism, sure.
But he didn't put his critics to silence.
For in 1783 Washington said: "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid we are brought to battle like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of that early this week.
The Governor's staff released the action as frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in a superb democratic state, which is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest consent to the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect to his electors and playing his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come on the side of the Governor - which is a public forum called officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolleys or spammers or hateful people who swing online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trunk.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked for hate crime.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary of the "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are considered by some rather than a so-called collective use and are not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the Governor's employees called "concentred spam attack" would probably call others "for language".
The Facebook Era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guide items or to arrest demonstrators and to put them to silence.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to criticize that he has abused Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week.
The president of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the first amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a elector from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At Washington’s time, the time of affordable Porto had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers attacked his leadership.
And even then Washington had an anonymous trolley.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote all the letters to newspapers who made Washington's decisions.
Petitions who criticized his position on the contract of Amity, trade and shipbuilding with Great Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't put her to silence.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for local comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who last year led left in Archerfield to the final round before losing against Paul Eales, is connected with the new post and acts as a tournament messenger in the name of the association founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he reaches his glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from its best side, he's in a great state.
Jerry made a great job when he set this place.
He is a zealous defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course."
The Englishman Eales looks forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won in his 32-year career both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour.
"It really feels special," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken from the program in the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magic.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home floor.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I am glad about how it went."
With the trio on the field, Ian Woosnam and the senior major champion Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are the former master winner.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers.

Less Lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
In the past two decades, more and less people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer.
The result is that scientists of the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) are in a study.
"After our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year," said Study Director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he studied his own studies on this issue in 1994.
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking a year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The constructions in the Villinger Straße are in full Gange and "are somewhat in time," says the head of the farm Fred Heinze.
The situation is more complicated in the area of the house connections than suspected, as much underground was hidden, which was not mentioned in the plans.
Transport, which repeatedly obstructs the construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp company's construction team.
"The ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and lockers is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road is locked and only the line buses are entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were very hard already.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She seldom uses a pot.
In their wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regime in the calm Indonesian province of Papua, the housewoman usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the occupied knobs are taken and swallowed with zealous, unwaxed hands.
Degei sits on the lamb floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example to wash clothes with dry water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a blank space serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around after 17 o'clock in the village," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,1026 elders were to vote in front of the occupational forces.
An existing movement that affected independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which holds control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is öde. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from Jayapura Province Capital to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive with car rental.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo trees, and of wave sheet roofs converted by roast into various yellow brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, sweater than journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans venerated a God called Uga Tame.
There were also other changes.
"We were not used to wear these clothing," Degei says, stating on her lively hand-weaved turban, her dark shirt and her bright rock.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and alphabetization rates in Asia.
But it's Indonesia's goldland too.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highlands province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
Freeport in 2015 alone has reduced 3.1 billion dollars of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wooden resources in the value of estimated U.S. 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of distress for the Papua that ensures that Indonesia's powerful military preserves an emerging presence.
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military members and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars, including up to 150,000 US dollars to one officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500.000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highland in the 1970s became a genocide in accordance with the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3.900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We're going to lose everything," says a report by the Archdiocese Brisbane from 2016, which contains reports on past year's horrors, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electrical strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researchers for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased, since Papua’s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million people in the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing, as Muslim economic migrants come from the populating islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese maintenance Cantines sell fried chicken and Gado gado, a mixed vegetable with peanut sauce served.
Local people fight to stay here.
"The migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old paniai resident who moved to the province capital Jayapura to work.
"It cost the indigenous Papua - the mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian president Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi in the genocide, promised to deal with inequality and injuries in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former roomman secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua there has been little change, and today the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hope that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a deep point only two months after Jokowis inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn their headlights on.
One of the soldiers attacked her tone and later returned with four soldiers, said the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beaten the group with their arms, said sacrifices and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was burned and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football court in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and led the Waita dance - running in the circle and imitating a bird singing - by Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm.
Some demonstrators began to slide stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses are more than three times opposing, they shoot them dead," says a official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto-Feedle of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and asked the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the ball came from the rows of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overfilled, many shots were fired," he added.
The indigenous man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only bears a name, said the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers only wanted to "safe" their station because they were attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.
The news about the killings came 'filtered' to Jakarta only the following day.
Three weeks in Jayapura, Jokowi held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical misfortunes in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 90s and the beginning of the 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that must be carried out," he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he talked to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all things are legally regulated," he said.
Wiranto, who accused the UN of "criminality against humanity", who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been involved, including the paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai soldiers took such claims with fierce infidelity.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drunk when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Upright villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warns.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting on the crowd and killing one.
"We were so panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was witnessing how the injured people were delivered here quickly, says the TIME.
"I've hidden myself in my house two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to take account of and withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the territory.
Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highland of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, who claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and willingly taken into custody, under the pretext of the "Securation of National Sovereignty".
Some never appear again.
Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place" among the people in Papua.
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is equally out of range.
The people here build everything they eat, especially notes and fruits and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs in the region usually go to the better trained and richer migrants.
Papua seldom has the capital or the necessary capabilities to lead their own companies competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Board of Family of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting remain anxious to international media.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission to film was given to them.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis electoral struggle to lift the limitations of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most calm eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of press control means that the international pressure to the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically seen the OPM support.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations and said in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to hide evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited on May 4th, the locals broke their silence and embarked him "We want freedom", according to a source that also wanted to participate in the meeting but would remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shoots," says Gobai, the Chairman of the Board of Family.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from the constant threat of a robbery military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, view their voice for Jokowi as a "should" that he has to pay back.
"You don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai victim performed a last symbolic act of Trouble: the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly toward the police and the military station.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they do not let the responsible people forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'Torch' cloud crater of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its doorbook in one of the world's highest residential towers on Friday and forced hundreds of residents to flee from 337 meters high, 79-story buildings.
It is the second fire that is fought through the high house in just two years, which is randomly called the torch tower (Fackel tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up in the fire alarm and in the cry of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting at 4.00 a.m. local time (00.00 p.m.) loosened the fire and cooled the building.
The government said that it was working on the provision of accommodations for the persons concerned.
The incident can revive questions on the safety of materials used in external areas of high-heavens around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from the clothing, the outside clothing to decoration or isolation.
In Britain, the police said that she believed that the system of plates could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June in which about 80 people died.
No Davis-Cup-Reform: Continue Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed through at the General Assembly with his great Davis Cup coup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was not supported by the necessary two-trirtel majority of people to play Davis-Cup only on two rates.
The five-set classics, although often very long, are therefore very appreciated, remain to the traditional application.
63.54 percent of the Member States voted for the reform, so the goal of the ITF president David Haggerty was only barely missing.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our Member States have not accepted the entire reform package for Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," said Haggerty.
You will continue to work to improve the application.
After many consents, not only the vote had come before the proposal to bring the final to a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: Thus, the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right of hosts in the first round in the next year.
In order to reduce the cost of organisers, the requirements in matters of training, etc. will be facilitated and the players will have to meet less official media in front of the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travellers brings prohibited items into the plane, finds a survey
A survey under flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent conscious or unconsciously prohibited objects smuggled by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent that entered the plane while carrying accidentally banned knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had lately discovered that they were wrongly traveling with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey for more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers rather disagree with the rules.
Of the respondents who have admitted that they have tried knowfully to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of the generation X.
The most frequent objects that were deliberately swept by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to have carried certain items with blades through safety control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods would have brought through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.
It is no surprise that the people who wore the worst smuggling - knowingly or unknowingly - by security were those who fly the most frequent.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about which liquids they may take or how much of them.
It is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of the liquids confiscated by the TSA are prohibited.
For a while, people thought that the TSA could view books as a smuggling product.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order
Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to indicate the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has previously argued that some of the customers have already withdrawn their unbinding reservation.
In addition to the constantly triumphing figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales goals, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less glossy number in the latest quarter account: the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In the past months, Musk had often purchased the more than 500.000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just starting.
Now Musk admits: From the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Criticians had repeatedly pointed out that it was merely non-binding reservations.
With a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the US 1000 dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely.
At the moment, 455,000 of these unbinding reservations were present, Musk opened a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could be a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth goals is not the demand, but the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 it will be 500,000 - all models together - a million in 2020.
The demand for this is evident.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "model 3" today, you may expect the delivery at the earliest of the second half of 2018 - if Tesla makes it possible to drive its nail new production roads, never in practice, without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if it comes to greater delays, then the incompatibilities of reservations could become the problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPO-Chef Pruitt withdraws due to the delay in the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions
One day after he had been accused by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Authority, resumed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama-Ara to reduce the emissions of air pollutants caused by Smog.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be the needs of the state environmental authorities in relation to reaction faster than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action which had been raised against his previous body in a Federal Appeal Court.
It is a deadline for States to comply with the 2015 standards for soil ozone on 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "intervening into local decisions or to hinder economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed into blocking or delaying regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden return from Wednesday is the latest legal return for the Pruitt's regulated rollback agenda.
Last month, a Bundesberufungsgericht in Washington decided that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies committed to monitoring and reduction of methane lecks.
In a opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its turnover at ozone standards simply strengthened the willingness of the EPO to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards.
"With previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused of by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation by court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority we have."
Nevertheless, the EPO opinion stated that Pruitt will use his "authorization for delay and all other legally available powers" in order to ensure that the rules "base on solid policy and the best available information".
The Republicans at the Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York General Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states who had accused the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The turning of the EPO - after our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the Smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and Columbia District.
Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refinery, chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmental protectors rejoiced about Pruitt's surprising course change.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we're getting in breathing," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We have to continue fighting against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to offer themselves to environmental polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery-Areal in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 16.30.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth beneficiary series can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and promoters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique narrative.
In 1267 the St. Hilarius chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Württembergian documentary: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Voggei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
The text of the document was on the Tumlinger Mountain except the former parish church also a magnificent court to which the Church or the patronate law belonged and not vice versa.
So there were also people living there.
According to the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the suburban village and the Oberdorf, which can be seen in Tumlingen' village image, was the "Berg" of the third, the magnificent settlement center of the village.
Old maps from the time around 1600 undermine these historical conditions.
The patronate law was derived from early medieval customs law.
A master who built a church, equipped and occupied with a priest continued to own this church and could inherit this church.
This was the right to use a priest or to suggest a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two burst on Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the window sheds were beaten and the glocksenseiles were stolen.
The roof was ugly.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the candle and church chairs and used them as a firewood.
Reasts of the Church threatened to crash in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was aborted.
Only the church tower was left.
In the New Year’s Night 1834 a storm split the church tower and half crashed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was canceled.
Only today's tower force remained a witness to the 750 years old history of church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schafigen Rentnern" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn care for the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, Tumlingen's friends and promoters invite the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius chapel.
This is formed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with word contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local chief Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 16.30 p.m.
The entry is from 15.30 a.m.
To the excursion of the Serenade, a cemetery takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Please enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers will see the fantastic views.
The serenade takes place only at dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to obtain the historical St. Hilarius plant, which is of significance for tumbling and listening loomers.
The friends and promoters Tumlingens feel particularly obliged to care for their homes, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to check approval of windcycles
"Boisheim refuses" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim refuses" asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Nette.
It has been illegally done.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind power stations could have been approved, since at the time of foursen only at the city border to Schwalmtal there was a wind power concentration zone.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind energy plants are basically possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are intended to prevent "saving" of the landscape.
Although the city of Four had decided a second wind power concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the area use plan, it had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf because of a form error.
"With the lack of planning requirements, the authorization decision is still illegal and therefore also withdrawal," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim refuses itself".
Current state of things: The City Council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; a permit for the district government is still outstanding.
Recognizes: "This is where the authorisation for the establishment of wind energy plants is excluded from planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received in the circle of four since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes it for the reason to review the matter again.
However, they are not expected to cause the procedure to be stopped.
With a view to running proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle did not intend to express itself on Thursday in substance to the argumentation of the association "Boisheim refuses".
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans on an area on the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four 200 meters high windcycles each.
Last year, the company, in which the city is part of foursen, had already concluded cargo contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of large terrain.
With the construction of the four wind-energy plants, the power supply of around 11 400 households is intended to be covered, which corresponds to about one fifth of the power supply of all four-sen households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Foursen's City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power stations in the Linnich Windpark at Aachen as well as for the participation in a wind power plant in Oebach-Palenberg in Heinsberg District.
Car and tractor crack together: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was injured fatally.
Two more people were easily injured.
The national road was locked over hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich went to Bogel with her car in the context of the accompanying driving with her 53-year-old mother as a companion to the L 333.
City and dealer plan "Heimat-Shoppen" Weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The Commercial Association and the City Administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping bubble into the city center.
As the Chairman of the Commercial Association, Christian König, announced, the "Heimat Shops" Weekend should sensitize the customers for which offers their own city besides the usual supermarket goods.
Accordingly, a market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite the "Midd Night Shops".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearer region.
In preparation, advertising spots are in the radio, an Internet video, and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, says Christian King.
City administration and commercial associations cooperate with the industrial and commercial chamber.
In this way, the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the "Attractive Downtown" project.
These include new offers such as the first "actival day" to the fountain festival, as well as sold-off Sunday, conversations with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential will be re- or re-established.
This includes Kurgists and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping.
At the end, everyone would have to contribute to living the city center - to renters, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
With a network to overcome the lethargy, which had partly spread, King had said in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, told that the third "Heimat Shops" day of the federal community, for the first time five Thüringer cities participated.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Holy City and Bleicherode.
The day should "were for the appreciation of local trade and show its significance for the common good of our cities," says Streich.
The action under the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour could influence his direct environment itself.
Two dead and several injuries after explosion at US school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more were injured, some of them severely.
According to the firearm, on Wednesday (local time) another injured person was in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building crashed in the explosion.
A first missing one was also buried.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of disaster, the authorities suspected work on a gas line.
At the holiday time, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put Mexico under pressure after transmitted transcripts of telephone calls due to the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him because he had pleaded the wall publicly. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump started his presidency campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US, and swearing to pay Mexico for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed an excited exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees who migrated to Australia would be "small", "mys" and "dom" and that the existence of the trade that was conveyed by the Obama government would make him look like a "depp" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump finished the call after he had said Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most inappropriate call for the whole day."
Moores Ford-Massaker: Activists resume racist Lynchact as a call for justice
A Ford Mercury in 1948 went through a group of viewers in rural Monroe, Georgia, resting on the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a man of middle age in a needle strip suit, took a long train on his sigar and looked through the windscreen.
Inside, the inmates swept in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man crushed.
"Hold him out of the car!"
Crying crushs the silence when a young black man was distorted from the seat of the rider.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is only one post.
But when a snake is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all in the audience were very real suckers.
Since 2005, civil lawyers have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to follow the night, where two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were aligned by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever accused of the murder.
"It is really incomprehensible that no single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the postage.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former member of the Georgia State of Congress and a lifelong civilian lawyer.
For him the postage serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
On 27 July 1946, a court doctor puts a bedcloth on the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford-Lynchen on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one was ever accused.
Although the suspects have been on a free foot for decades, civilian lawyers say that the double motivation for the Lynch action was always known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the first time that black citizens in Georgia gave their voice in the pre-election struggle in summer.
About the same time as the choice, according to the FBI of the black farmer Roger Malcom, a white owner, Barnett Hester, stood down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumors in the city were that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, said the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey in prison.
But when they left the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, Harrison, who prepared and ordered the murder," concludes a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more pregnant.
"It was a electoral manassaker," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you are allowed to register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual postage of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their representation is spectacular, striking and is founded in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look at, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the line, because we'll be confronted with its hurry in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the blacks - pushed themselves into a room and laughed when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is a Greenes Co-Regisseur here.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan member for years, but he said that the role never becomes easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who screams and stirs him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still ugly.
"I just don't think white people said a --- he."
"But," one of the other black performers whispered.
"You only have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy is moving in the room, a feeling of comradery replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-Wort, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repeat ends violent and fast.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman, dressed with a grief dress, stands above the bodies of the actors and leads Billie Holidays mourning loaf "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it is a group of about four dozen spectators of sweat and tears out of the eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down only the road.
They have experienced all of Georgia's pressing humidity for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them to the graves of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrim trip.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels splendid.
When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the quantity to get closer and inspect the body name.
Children stick to their heads, register the fake blood and the silent body and whisper each other.
"You're not really dead," murmuring a little boy, as if he wants to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the amount - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit that played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then collapses together in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispered one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for one reason."
Later, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At a table a white couple from Atlanta is excited about the postage with a black couple that they have just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that have left the performance behind.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and deeds... from people who look like yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me, let me believe that the linen is still going on," she added, "now it is called only police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone Brook's court holds on his table, he eats and remembers the rights of citizens.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The posture is inspiring in some way, for it describes the horror of what we have to bear, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's so, if we don't learn anything from it, it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it."
The Wagnerianer in Bayreuth reconciled "Götterdämmerung"
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also sets on a colorful-frivole inscending against gigantic, six-story culisses.
The rotary buffalo (formed by Aleksandar Denic) shows optionally a delicate street corner with wallrest and dönerbude in Berlin, a "plaste and elaste" logo of DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before this, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer in which the Rhinets pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Pulled oil barrels remember Castorf's Leitmotiv - Money, Power and Gier - that draws through his "Ring" inscent.
The three Rhinetöchters - singing by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), crushing a body in Hollywood-Manier in the suitcase and giving the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the delicious Hagen that surrounds the Aura of a heavy weight boxer.
Brutally the scene when he hits Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus oak) has to believe.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrating stormy, who are modest and forming hands to the Merkel-Raute.
There is a great adventure for the festival orchestra, which appears at the stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in poor leisure clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his direct team was expected with tension.
If he had to be given a valid pepper concert in 2013, five years later, there was a great joy in which the single "Buh" rubs were undergoing.
Chairman Katharina Wagner should have enjoyed it.
"You realize that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of its way of view.
I'll draw a positive reputation.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in their volunteer year in several places.
Where else?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture stock, once a week, I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school in the open day.
How are your experiences?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old, so you're a late-run volunteer.
How's that happening?
Quantity: I made abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked myself what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight that you can see how it is on site, perhaps in the focal point, really.
And was it that way?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
In the winter semester, I will start my study in social affairs.
I'm going to study dual, probably in the Youth Office of Herne to be a social worker's training and study in Hamm at the University of Faculty.
Is it not unusual to have several different locations of use during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It's probably always about where to make his FSJ.
It can be made from age home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing I was irritating.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really ends.
Unlike the construction engineering study?
Quantity: Well, this is not about calculating statics.
There are people who have a very different story behind each other.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always need to take care of it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any touching anxieties?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
It's a area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but so is life just.
Pearson shortens another 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend to revive the business
The British Education Group Pearson said on Friday that it would reduce further 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate individuals by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme was being launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company.
The job reduction, which General Director John Fallon announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs were already lost.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost reduction programme a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business made by the fast step towards digital learning.
The company that had sold his participation in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann last month said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it had increased 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoi Attack of Kabul: Nato Soldat killed in suicide dance
A suicide killer has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a soldier of the Nato and violated several others, says officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured, informed a statement of the Nato.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died during the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Kabul.
On Monday a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
An opinion of the Nato says that the explosion had happened on Thursday evening when a common patrouille with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised explosive set by people".
The statement states that all injuries are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for the NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there was at least 1,662 civil deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, some 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide autobom killed at least 30 people in a mostly shy district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had executed this attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack of the country since the US-led troops in 2001 oppressed the Taliban from power.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, since US President Donald Trump considers increasing the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in recent weeks the suicide dates in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policy, and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO shall reverse the decision to delay the Smog rules after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Authority has repealed a decision to delay the regulation of the Government of Obama, which states are obliged to reduce the Smog-related emissions, which took place a day after 15 states were accused of the Agency for the step.
The EPO announced the decision late on Wednesday to advance the so-called "ozone provisions 2015" and said that it showed the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPO-Chair Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPO's intention to measure pollutants emissions in a part of the country in order to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards by one year to October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda, which, according to Trump, is intended to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the decline of democratics and nature conservation groups, which are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The website of the EPO says that the inhalation of air, which contains ozone, can " reduce lung function and strengthen breathing symptoms" such as as asthma.
Council of the Community
At the end, the decision was clear: in two votes, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to establish a Community area in the future senior residential facility.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing property was signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will last until the area belonging to the church community until now is in the municipality, there is no more planning barrier for the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a discussion on a Community area for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with still 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council are proposing to provide such a Community area not only as a meeting point for the residents of the elderly, but openly into the community.
For example, the word of the "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which has already been made for the current budget last autumn, will be forfeited by means of funding.
The construction is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a Community area would, according to Tjaden, be eligible by 60% of 30%.
The decision suggests to signal the investor that in this respect it is not intended to throw a knife between the legs, the finding that both sattle - which is due to environmental construction - as well as pult roof - would be possible, which reduces the height of the tread and makes the construction more economically.
It's not just Wilfried Sohmer that's this addition.
If it helps, he's happening the Gremium unanimously.
It's not that easy to do with the Community area.
Daniela's reputation refers to many of the own buildings with which you don't get so much progress, for this one is now lying out of the window at the Community room, she says, "I'm hard to do with it".
Yvonne Staiger is desperately speaking for the Community area, but it is absolutely against a communal involvement.
It looks behind a concealed subsidie to assets or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area one does not give a grant, but gets a real countervalue, in doubt, is the contradictory.
Staiger's request to split the proposal accordingly finds three advocates.
In the original programme, Stefan Haller summarizes: "When we take this decision, we make a huge step towards closing a huge gambling in our infrastructure."
Kollision with car: cycling is slipped on the road
When crossing the road, a 82-year-old cyclist in Garath was captured by a car on Wednesday and severely injured.
As the police told, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the road from the road to Hilden on his bike at 12.20 a.m..
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road The Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder travelled on the road, he apparently did not respect counter traffic.
He met with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was swept on the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich must leave David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba must leave the game against Dortmund sausen.
With staff care, the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven professionals lack the title defender in the Supercup against the pokal winner.
Personal care at the German football record champion Bayern Munich will grow before the supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also leave David Alaba in Duell with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
In addition, the Munich Manuel New, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the last six test games, Ancelotti has made responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good at last."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "stricky, intense game".
The Duell of the two German soccer weights attracts the fans into their ban.
The game is sold out with 81.360 viewers, the German football League (DFL) informed on Friday.
Walking from star to star in the reservoir
In the harz, the first "star path" is to be created throughout the country.
This is the plan of the club Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the need for information by many resin visitors, it was said.
He combines nature, science, movement and sports performance.
Members want to set up tablets along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "favourable installations in five to six places" in the upper resin.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohesgeiß und Sieber.
The information on the tables is intended to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path of the train will be extended.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example, about the physics of the individual stars," said the club.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why a star illuminated more than another, although he was much further away.
It also means in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see.
The club has been working in the St. Andreasberg mountain town since 2014.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Protection.
Often, from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxie with mere eye can be seen clearly.
In the Uni-City since 2003, on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Funding Association, there has been something similar to the planned asterisk – the planetary path.
Beginning in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the inside of our solar system, the planet road with its sets leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "exterior" location in Diemarden (Gemeinde Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The sets with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are exactly set in distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks so on a bullet of 6.5 millimeter diameter, while the exactly 75 meters away sun still measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is well four kilometres.
While the light takes about eight hours from sun to pluto, pedestrians need a good hour to sete with pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the world.
The march to the next fixed star, but would last half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to incorporate the most exciting box fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unpleasant World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Champion.
After Garcias Sieg by a unanimous decision on the former four division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound for pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you doing, champion?
I wish you a lot of luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at ESPN.
When the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko Manager Egis climate noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm a former feather weight," Garcia recalled.
"I got up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down on lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweightlers [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans ask.
Let us give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135 pound debut this year to agree with Garcia in the next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight track fight in the forum on 23 September.
"This struggle could take place in pay-per-view mode, because all fans asked for it," said Garcia and later expressed himself open to fight with the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "a huge fighter" and he might participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks that seeing the three-fight champion from Riverside" very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said that the focus was to show impact strength, then boxes.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own fight.
"This is the battle that needs to be carried out.
No other fight brings so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I waited for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four injuries after tyres
In the case of an accident on the A7, four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon.
After the first information, the driver of a Opel Zafira at 16.30 a.m. before the connector market spread probably lost control of his vehicle after a tyre placer.
The car slew to the right into the bay, where he crossed himself and then stayed on the roof in the green strap.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked to the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left line could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Dryer chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 seasonal waist against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue brings points.
Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the first season game, and the result was that not the two countertors would have been against Braunschweig at 2:2.
"They were two countertors too much, and we have to watch even better in Aue," says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge, the Threeerkette will also be further optimized.
And a gate after an escape, the fortunes no longer want to catch.
"For the future it will be so that no one will be on the line next to Michael (rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that after the experiences in preparation with the three chain, his team is better managed than with the four chain.
"But I don't know how to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we just have in the three chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players that can build well," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is, but we're harmonizing even better and we don't make so many playback mistakes in the building."
Of course Hoffmann is also going to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can speak of a mistaken start after a difference, you don't know.
The performance could be okay," said Hoffmann.
"But if we can stand with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the pokal, we will certainly be able to speak of a regular seasonal wake."
His trainer didn't want to know anything about that.
"When I start the season, I only judge after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage to Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be abandoned prematurely because of an unwetter.
"Now they can start the season quasi with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might be even fresher because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascending favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they're currently standing," says the interior defender of Fortuna.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting in the final (fast) stadium of Aue as a lighter favorite on Sunday.
"That we're taking them away, just because we have the right to come among the first six, is bleedingness," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive at just a defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which you have to beat from the front," explains Fortuna's Chefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and superstitious."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age evaluation tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the persons tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started carrying out the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are to make the assessment of age more accurately after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticized for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were less-year-old.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6.880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from the mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were considered 18 or older, while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under the age of 18".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been persistent over the past months.
"We do not see a big difference in statistics in the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older.
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years of age this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee gels are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A scepticist is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they went through the puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age to be judged in this way is very unsure.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't do it as if we could," he said the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of assessing a child as adults is low.
The greatest risk lies in it when the person is close to under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Fully in the plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is a good step forward.
On Wednesday a seven tons of concrete was installed on the bridge on the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good in time, it's great," says Reinhold Light, construction manager at the Department of Streets and Transport in the Public Office of Freiburg.
In April the work started on all three rehabilitation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach at the same time.
The building end is planned for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vault bridge of concrete dressed with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, she has come into the years now.
In order to ensure the stability and safety of transport, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red bunt sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 metres wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side.
This is a marginal fixation, which is also used as an operating path.
In the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 metres wide bridge cap is expected to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path will go.
The special thing is that it is finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertip feeling requires the placing of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fiber cable that many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand-list.
In addition, fish and cancers had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the farm building and the collectiveweiher towards Schramberg, traffic is one-purely regulated by a sample.
For the construction of the bridge at the Louderbacher City entrance, the road in the area of the bridge is completely locked at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden".
The cost of the three bridge adjustments is EUR 700 000.
The whole is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German potato salat
It doesn't happen so often that parties are strangled, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is hard to bring under a hat.
The parties represented in the District Day of Volcanic Eifel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag on that day, because the AfD in the Gerolstein City Hall of Rondell invites "great campaign" to be called by poster.
And well-known names come to the start - like Alice Weidel, who, together with Alexander Gauland, forms the top duo for the Federal Day election on September 24, and the deputy federal president Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the event start on the spot want not to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate them.
The motto "The ice remains colorful."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the wellplace, but now takes place on the parking lot below the roundell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that offers.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forums A world and one of the relevant organizers, is very pleased: "Toll how many people have gathered here."
There are music and a lot of food, including a "ur German potato salad that can also eat the AfD easily," says the woman who brought him.
The police ordered many officials to Gerolstein, which shows presence especially at the train station, which is only a few meters away from the events.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD volcanic eifel reports that he has tried to make such an event and get the surcharge.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a cancellation because due to the already built Laurentius kirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is delighted that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
Looking at the event on the roundell front square, he says, "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
This is also the case: At 20 a.m. on the Rondell front square, a band provides entertainment, in the city hall several speakers, including the Rhineland-Pfalzische AfD chairman Uwe Jung.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestagswahl Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal president Beatrix of Storch to hold their speeches.
Unchanged is the police presence, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.
Something more than an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the front court have a longer breath, but there is also a clearing shortly after 21 o'clock.
The police can take off - no special events.
Posaune hits trumpets
A hearing with Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli there are in the Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpet Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets on Black Forest", or also "Balkanfolklore" meets a classic German training with roots in bubble music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli.
Both unite the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments, but also to merge the limits of the different genres.
So Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with the two as in a new garment, Daniel Schnyders "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of jazzecho prize winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free games mix into a fascinating overall artwork.
This core part of the programme was only launched this spring with enormous success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart speaks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat him until the end of their life.
But I want to try out everything," says Kristen Stewart quite openly about their bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what comes next?'."
The most well-known relationship of Hollywoodstar was Robert Pattinson, who finally was bitterly dispersed to her "Twilight" colonist.
Nevertheless, the brunette performer assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I'd played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and sincerely believed in it.
So I've never been confused or disabled.
I just never liked to be taken seriously."
Especially below, she suffered according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she prefered to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
It really hurt me very much.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bub.
I really felt attacked, scared, and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'Both, be proud of you!'."
Especially to the public, they don't like to explain their love: "The people expect you to behave in a certain way and that angry me.
And maybe some call me unthankful, but I don't like to justify myself before the public."
The Governor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at an announcement with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I'm a democratic governor."
The announcement broke out in joy.
"I will change my registration to the Republicans tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a coach I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye before.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee gave a statement on Thursday evening, in which it said, "The change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legal bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from above to bottom and cannot find a positive, agreeing message," said RNC President Ronna McDaniel in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises "very" Russian excuse for Doping scandal
On Thursday, the world leader of light athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as an open apology from Russia as a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resumed in sports.
Russia's Light-Athletic Chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Light-Athletic World Championships that the exile of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the Doping.
He said that he was sorry for "all athletes who were taken away gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of State-supported doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognized that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said that he was also "delighted" that Russia accepts the criteria for its re-establishment.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment of rebuilding Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guide principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will act as neutral players at the light-atletic world championships that start in London on Friday after the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for reconstruction.
Drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still freely active, he said reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.
Gray act for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral celebration in the north-hessian Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two thought of a helicopter absurd in Mali.
The ceremony took place in the Domstadt on Thursday under high security arrangements.
The defense minister Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing to the still unexplained cause of crash.
She described the two pilots who died as "knowers of her professional".
"We condone ourselves in front of this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old head of staff from North Hesse had died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Her sarge was transferred to Germany and accompanied on Thursday by a dead guard of the Federal Army to the Fritzlar Dom St. Peter.
In the afternoon, only the members of the church took part in the church.
Afterwards, the funeral began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Federal Army and politics.
Among these were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Federal Army Volker Wieker.
Serious guests lay down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the sarge.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Minister of the Leyen described the soldiers who died as "highly decorated" and entertained.
The head of the staff had built the flight operation of the fighting hub screwdriver Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regime, to whom the soldiers belong, said: "If this crew couldn't turn the crash, then no one would have been able to do it."
Doubts at the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Leyen: the use is dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral celebration, the sisters were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Federal Army did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife.
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buryed next to his wife after his death.
That told the king's house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish king's couple is assisted in the Domkirche of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophag for the two.
The Queen agreed to her husband's decision, it continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be assisted in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a hole that he wasn't happy with his title.
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would be happy to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also released the title "Prince Meal".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted, he does not consider himself equivalent to his wife - not even after death, Lene Balleby explained, the head speaker of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will be ultimately unclear.
However, he does not intend to be assisted in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years.
The born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble genus, had met Margrethe in 1965 in London.
He worked at the Temse in the French Embassy.
During his later wife's sympathy, Prince Henrik always flew to the people's sympathy, in his almost 50-year-old regentship with the Danishs had a severe state.
In a autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "Some months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was swaying, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk shrubs instead of stricks, citroen instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia-Tabak and who had the reputation here to be the brand of society critical intellectuals, I could not hope for reluctance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That's the same two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a rapid re-election of the country day, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday, Parliament was voting for the resolution.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green Member from her country-day group in Lower Saxony had brought the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag election, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its close one-stimming majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Greens-Deputy Elke Twesten founded its step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in their elections in Rotenburg (Wumme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Group Chief Björn Thümler wants to embrace his group.
CDU and FDP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new country day will be selected regularly on January 14th.
Thümler said that the red-green country government must now decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the country day decides its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on Tuesday about its further action.
The constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag withdraws the Prime Minister's confidence and chooses a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined legally clean," said Thümler.
"You will quietly discuss all questions when they are legally examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something curios".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She referred to himself as an adherent of black-green.
The Greens called on the abbreviated Members to return their country day mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she returns her country-day mandate, which she received through the green list, with immediate effect," told the country-presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Group Chairman of the Green Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of each Twest.
She consciously decided not to take a debate in the Group.
"Of the background that there were no substantial differences, we can't understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transgression of the Dutch Green Members every Twest to CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to the voters, but also betrayal to red-green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the country day re-elected quickly.
The exit of Twesten costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "in her injured jealousy and in her frustration put her personal interests in the well-being of the country," criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigen game and tries to beat political capital from it."
Niedersachsen's CDU Group Chief Björn Thümler wants to advise his Members to take each Twest into the CDU.
The political leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, suggested Twesten to distort the result of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then the strongest in front of the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a thin majority of one voice in the day of the country.
Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is spoken and answered in the interview with the German editorial network (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp impression.
At the Consumer Protection Portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the Federal States shall provide the latest information on the Eier-Chargen concerned.
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at present, a health risk is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the informant is not really perceived by the Federal Agricultural Minister?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately been set up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since Germany has become acquainted with.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade has to ensure, as the manufacturers have, that the products sold are transportable and indispensable to health.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not capable of traffic.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time the companies are not responsible.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production companies are not directly debted.
Rather, because of illicit practices, they have to expect economic damage from service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in serious cases.
Is it only lacking in personnel or also in firm competence?
It was just the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent.
For this reason, a consistent information of such events and the transfer to the prosecutors in the cases where offences may occur is crucial.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to have a complete information.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive exclusively safe and transportable foods.
If an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly embarrassed.
Due to the funded, manufacturers, dealers and consumers have come into a situation which is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the holding of food-supplier animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This needs to be consistent and worked with high pressure on all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the matter will be clarified quickly and easily.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure from European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the leading organization that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions-League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by the UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signs and brings it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team through the energy-rich rule family of Qatar.
Associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break-even point in their soccer-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations who had taken up enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively deceived and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners revoked their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from the concentration to the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015 into Ungnade, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter from excessive expenditure.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at the UEFA, against The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the purchase-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for the accounting of the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sum of payments for the next five years can be issued to 44.4 million euros in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a penalty of 60 million euros (and then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
The UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to overlap their financial supervision by breaking up their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsoring of the PSA was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the Organisational Committee of 2022.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become WM messengers and that such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.
The previous penalties against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more aware of any attempt to cope with the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory conversations with PSG about Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG 2015/16 gained more than EUR 10 million with revenue of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year are still to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, Merchandising and Tricot Sales.
The association assumes that after signing, sales will rise by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish newspaper AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership to PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It's the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country owns a association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay, because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In the past years, Chocolate has produced Frey Board Schocolade for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is at a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the "Nordwest Switzerland" newspaper on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and undergo quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
About 17 million small redwise packed shoggi boards to 14 grams per year distribute the flight accompanying boards to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to make any information about the costs.
Industry insider estimates the order volume according to "North West Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter earns an annual turnover of about one billion francs.
But more important is all the advertising effect: For a Schoggi manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
How many candidates there are at the new invitation, the Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond Spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not accessible for an opinion.
Schokoladen-Taples has been spreading Swiss on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long distance flights, the first class customers are spoiled with delicious eggs by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the business class wet passengers Schoggi by Lindt and in the economy class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed on the short track by Chocolat Frey, both in business and economic class.
Athletics - Discus Olympician Robert Harting reaches WM-finals
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympiager of 2016, failed in the national WM exclusion and was able to look at the discus contest only from the Tribüne.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgie goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" to the niche
This replay of history is nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-years-gringe-era (as the memorators David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001 before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Ruddd went to larger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is likewise a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels as if the time was bare.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking box of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stealing on the core of the Gag - actors of middle age play great children who are grown up - they nevertheless failed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the guinea principle, including a reef to the Stalker films of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that Smooths the Cradle").
At one point a character is covered by an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, Katie (Marguerite Moreau) has not yet forgotten.
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy, evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underlip bart of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old boy.
It's the moments of random madness that could heated this franchise like a kind of recurring "Seven Up!" series, until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how to visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminding of another kind of nostalgie: the renewal of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-Art-West Ringkampf-Iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director suggests to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles – a hard-sowned Gregor and an idealist ice cream – are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to look at (the police spends time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides for a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan maske - that it often plays as one.
In six long episodes, it gets away, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", who was edited to a lower length, could better deliver his Agitprop-Satires, since Gregor and Iosef are visiting the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a pile of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for a battle.
The fictional Romanian Creator was not wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and with their own.
Battle against drug-mafia in the country
The police managed to hit the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the prosecutor of Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused persons were arrested between 25 and 77 years of age and already imprisonment orders against them.
In addition, the officials ensured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, shot weapons and several hundred thousand euros.
Two persons were arrested in parallel races in Italy.
Against the two suspicious Italians there were German detention orders.
The two are likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
Over 300 policemen were in use.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, severe violence, attempted murder, robbery and depression.
Since summer 2016, the prosecutor has established constance against organised drug trafficking in the southern German region.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a regular exchange, and the intermediaries of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Thus, on Wednesday morning, the grand utilization was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
In particular, Italian nationals came into the sight of the investigations with a close reference to Italian mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired to a restaurant early in the morning, is expected to go to the account of the bands.
In a way, large gaps are complaining in the foreign regime
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign director in Germany has considerable deficiencies.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in the case of asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's Refugee Management Officer, Frank-Jürgen way, has pointed out to large gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partly serious misdecisions" in the case of asylum procedures and deportations, warned in an analysis of the South German newspaper.
According to the register, ten million people with foreign nationality are listed, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Since the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good until now.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, "by people who have long been no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."
"Manual data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues.
In addition, EU citizens who would not have to travel out are listed in the statistics on travellers.
However, such wrong assignments resulted in "a distorted debate on dealing with travellers," the analysis states.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government apparently began sending refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they arrived there.
This is based on an internal paper of the Federal Migration and Refugees Office (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
Accordingly, the BAMF says that such procedures are "concerning families with children, except for infants and small children, to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was virtually no longer possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on site.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU State are responsible for which they first reach.
If a migrant continues to another EU country, that state can send him back to the land of entry.
To explain, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has provided guarantees for the accommodation and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers that these commitments are sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The interior political spokesman of the left-hand fracture in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Familys with children threatened because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system of human rights incorporating conditions and a threat to child welfare".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
All in advance Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his donations.
Traditionally, the community appreciates the multiple willingness to spend blood at the meeting of the municipal council.
"It's generous how our body is designed for it and we'll give respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers, still unselfish," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"Oneone blood donation helps several people," explained the head of the circulation of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conservations are being crushed into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in spring.
"In this year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK creativity leader.
Obviously, the change to the Theaterhaus led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 donations.
Half so many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave 500 milliliters of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation has reduced speculations over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "drags" when it maintains the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) political decision-makers agreed by 6 to 2 to maintain interest rates to 0.25%, with less members striving to increase this month, since weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% for 2018 and 1.6% for 2018 and warned that the pressure on budget income would continue, with an estimated increase of almost 3% inflation in autumn.
But she signaled that in the next few years interest increases would be needed to reduce the inflation heated by Brexit and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mammut conjuncture package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the next February, although it has been said that it is now expected that it will make 15 billion pounds more available in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, since the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."
To the interest rates, it repeated that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "a little greater" extent than the markets would expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "steply" and "limited".
The below corrected growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It retained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news about the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have diminished the rising expectations to increase interest and GDP has increased from 0.2% in the second quarter of the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easy to recover by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by an increasing inflation and low levels of salary, as the intensification becomes even worse before it gets better.
She added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot "hinder income breakdown", but she added that the wages will recover "natural" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully achieve prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last judgment on interest rates, the reputation had increased after an interest increase, as inflation increased pressure on hard-naired households, while three political decision-makers demanded an increase of 0.5% in July.
The inflation fell from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the bank said that this was expected and would attract it again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overlap in relation to its 2% target was "ganz" to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in the Swap Councils, the mortgage market is expected to be more competitive, since creditors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals expire and close the new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates become increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is to describe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposition prophylaxe (pre-EP) that can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients can now be supplied by health service over an estimated 10,000 people for an estimated three-year study.
He declared himself willing to finance the process after the appeal court had confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described this as "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposition prophylaxe (pre-EP) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection hazards.
To take PrEP before sex means that just enough medications are available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken two hours before sex every day or so.
Those who are concerned for treatment include swine or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified to agree to the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a household doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as it is intended to be used, absorbed and implemented in a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overcome the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress of more than three decades in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted on needy and endangered people, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September to September, people with a high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We welcome this announcement very warmly."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been acquired, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow Minister of Health, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcomed and overwhelming after months of delay and reluctant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our HIV prevention approach and the transfer of this life-changed infection can end.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society.'
Living the Great Life: Intermediate and smart designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is evidence of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold their bags.
"Before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overcrowded.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a storage room and an intermediate floor to optimize the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my request," she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the standard.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without we had to buck.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but making the steel so that it had the right height for the function at the top or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms full of height above each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let him work longer.
In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all covers and glasses of Joanne.
By perception of a more glamourous room, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.
Compoundable kitchens are nothing new.
The particular thing about this is that it is a garage agency.
"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan from the steel strengthened, furnished MDF door.
"It's contradictory, so it's very easy to slide when you move the door up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage room, Joanne was able to win additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form a real estate broker will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that provide the room with its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help you create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standardically to something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US Dollar Real Estate Imperium
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton football club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He brought him to the Supreme Court to explain how to divide their property and business assets.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have 38 real estates worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburb.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin, described by Paul as "main operator and dominating personality" in the De Lutis family, has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A court act states that this means that Colin owns the value of $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit.
Last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failures.
The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but suggests Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The cost rises in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers held from both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacy shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood love in which Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with their sons in a nice way.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis business group, where Colin claims that Mark had been paid $10 million in losing the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says "were bitter about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin was very reluctant, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much," because the case was before the courts.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to complain about me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to fulfill his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said and added that he "have always hoped for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump's new head of staff plans to limit the President's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Head of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump, including the reports of the news media, in the hope of keeping the boss on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the President's hands.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow, whether on paper or in letterings, because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information."
Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to teach Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television is enough for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was annoyed for an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of posts to be convinced," said former electorate Sam Nunberg on Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trump's Tweets would have included more ignorant without their interventions.
We'll probably never learn anything about the Tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees have already managed him to keep anger away from him, then their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
A part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that might promote their views from the world.
Politico, who is very concerned with this story, reported in May on the favour of consultants to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmaker:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press sections, especially those with damaging leaks, and to find out where they come from.
That was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone wrongly accused the President of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the vice-president Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of sighings or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he in the past spoke false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started to consult employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tryed to implement a system to manage and document the paper crème, receive the Trump".
How did that work?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.
Most of the criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped.
The police all over Europe send this summer (virtuelle) postcards to dangerous criminals on the escape.
Since the addresses of the searched serious criminals are of course not known, indications from the population are hoped and requested.
On Friday, Europol reported about the action followed by the "EU Most Wanted" adventure calendar of winter.
Experiences would have shown that many refugees hide themselves from holiday destinations, it was said by Europol.
21 postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries were compiled.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online seekers have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to indications following the publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a tomb and return to the 'Millionarys series'
Some of the most prosperous houseowners of the West Midlands are again standing with some determined travelers on war foot that have negotiated a tomb drawn from the municipality to call back a field in front of their master houses.
The travelers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, called the "Millionarys series".
They have brought horses, babies and a army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but they have not been scared from a grave that was excavated by the Council to prevent their accidents.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense plants and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have troubled the Council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement, since it was useless when dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said: "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
A spokesman of the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond the streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls. We take the necessary legal steps so that they can continue as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof is Waldhotel Luise
From the former Birkenhof hotel, the Waldhotel Luise is located.
The house in front of the gates of joy towns is currently renovated and will be reopened on March 1st next year.
These are good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the ambience company mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenues from the Kurtaxe.
In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees coming into the district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a gathering accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum applicants by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the municipal council at that time.
But above all, the Mayor Julian Osswald defended the location of the hotel and spoke of seriously interested people at the house at that time.
He should keep it right.
The team Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star club category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joy city.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Badenalb.
It is called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the previous Hotel Birkenhof, building cabinet containers have been before the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were screwed out, decks were partly removed, old baths were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There's still much to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything will be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large handy showers, the entrance area is redesigned, it will be built in new windows.
Everything should be "beautiful near" later, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room include the equipment.
You do not want to position on the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a lifted downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to be wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidayers, groups or businessmen are to feel comfortable in the hotel.
He already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, says Scherer.
The city's ideas are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Thomas Scherer does not want to decide exactly after the amount of the investment.
Snapping under a million euros, he expects.
The external facilities are also brought to frontman, which is already clearly visible.
In an interior courtyard, a large terrace will be available from the restaurant that is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia's affair: U.S. Sonderermittler sets Grand Jury
In Russia's affair around US President Donald Trump, special commander Robert Mueller said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
In the past weeks, the Gremium has taken up the work, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" called on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first charges of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. secret services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to have been actively involved in the presidential election campaign in 2016.
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump's election team and Moscow.
The research should focus on several men who acted as consultant of the Republican in the election struggle.
According to reports, Mueller also took over more and more Trump's private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special intermediary Trump personally came into the center and examined the accusation that the president might have disabled justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether to raise charges.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called chambers of charge.
They are usually turned on when they are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The body can also be switched by the prosecutor in order to preload persons for consent under oath.
According to the CNN broadcaster, preloads were already presented that turn around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting had been invited to make a statement in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's consultants and son of Schwiegers Jared Kushner and his then election chief Paul Manafort were involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. television that the introduction shows that Mueller doesn't let himself intimidate in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be put to the end in order to decide on the appeal.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new unveilings, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russian history is a complete invention," said Trump.
The theme gives the Democrats a way to "are good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he was not aware of the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But this also usually worked in secret, he emphasized.
The White House supports any measures that accelerate the work of the special intermediary in a "fair" way.
The former FBI CEO James Comey said three times that the president was not found.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed, it continued in the declaration.
Mueller was only used after Trump Comey fired.
Because of this screw, accusations against Trump became loud, he wanted to hinder justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop the investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to the U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special media and his employees.
This caused speculations about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.
Unlike an independent special agent of the convention, such as in the Watergate affair around President Richard Nixon, who later resigned, Mueller has a position in which he could be theoretically fired on the president's urgency by the Ministry of Justice.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senatoren presented draft laws on Thursday after which the special intermediary could no longer be released as easy.
Antarctica: Gigantian iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the Westantarktis, a giant iceberg of the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin has resolved from the Schelfeis.
This announced the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday.
The large colony of 5800 square kilometres over a trillion tonnes now drive north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted.
It is one of the largest ice giants that have registered in the past three decades with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres.
There's no danger for humans from him.
According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear.
Overall, however, there have been a series of unusual ice shelf collapses in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact background.
Many researchers believe that this could be related to the warming of the earth.
The now canceled colossus has been part of the Larsen-C shelf feast.
Shelf fry swims on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
So it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Northern of this shelter was disturbed by the balance of waxes and cancel a few years ago.
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete shelter.
It speaks a few things for that the Larsen-C celebration is in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as present.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and could fall, if a piece is broken at a key place.
The melting of shelter and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and drown ice as much water as it produces after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelter causes the glaciers to mood directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This may increase sea level, but only in a small degree, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C shelf feast is the fourth largest skirt feast of Antarctica, according to AWI specifications with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front side to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sign now comes into a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
"This is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and may be collapsed, his colleague Adrian Luckman added: "Our models say that it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not revert the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades, very many ice shells of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen.
This long zipper of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and counts to the areas where the temperature is the fastest.
CDU wants household tariff with staff
Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free posts, the CDU calls on the employers' association to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the circuit day has plucked through 41 new offices in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainers have their first working day behind themselves.
The curriculums at the circle are apparently very desired.
About 620 applications were to be recorded for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle lacks further personnel in order to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
There are currently 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.
Doctors and engineers are sought, among other things, as well as the powers of the general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the round-day and meet the lack of professionals in the administration.
According to the request of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept of personnel gaining and personnel development".
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of professionals but to counteract future-oriented candidate shortages, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented to the inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-reinsters and include an open training, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is about a regular "competition of public employers".
In addition, a high number of employees who separate from the service of disease or age.
So, at the very best time to act so that no more jobs are unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Chief Group of the CDU, goes beyond the joint request with its party.
He recently provided a feat-dick surprise in the round day when he publicly questioned the covering of staff costs and astonished the rest of the parties.
People want to review all possibilities that allow for the withdrawal from the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the circuit administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - should seek a domestic tariff," said people.
This is why the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides the tariff regulation for the public service.
The salaries are currently prescribed precisely, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level oriented to professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the rising number of asylum applicants, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: you have too little staff.
Italy intensifies the tone to NGO-Migrants-Retting boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Young Rettet' because their team had effectively cooperated with human dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express a detailed accusation of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life remains our primary priority. So we are very sorry that we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
"We can only judge all accusations that are being raised at the moment after we have collected all information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Young Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is assumed that his crew takes hose boat migrants on board that are delivered to them directly by human dealers and that the smugglers can exit so that the ships can be reused.
At least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the act of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The occupation is suspected of removing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have a Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in searching and rescuing operations have so far declared themselves willing to comply with the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable because they would not bring about "real changes or disabilities" of their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize Procurement Organization is doctors without borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants who have arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen strongly over the last few weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors have brought fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with the Mayor of Libya this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who hope to leave these countries to reach Europe.
Increases and Trials
Neun Weilermer Bikers, the "Berliner Outposten" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in Wachenheimer Valley was a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to Michaelkapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfalzer Forest and the above layers.
In the meantime, there were repeated increases for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, viewpoint was reached at the point of view, linked by "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many meters of height were again said.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and return huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing Sole in the open air inhalatorium.
New town was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of height, the group had met the Pfalzer Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is equipped for e-sport
Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through wind and weather over the stadium grasses?
The fact is: E-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions fans and huge tournaments with high gagen included.
This has also been acquainted with the first Bundesligavereins who are increasingly engaged in this area.
At the beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an E-Sport department in mid- July and contracted two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to enthusiast entirely new young target groups for the VfB," says Board Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure, "that on this train several clubs are still going up."
The next weekend, the FIFA World Football Association in London organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup", with which the Gamers of various clubs join each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-port.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"In particular, the real football has to deal with the 14-30-year-olds that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially Asians.
With prominent e-sportlers under contract, you could be more often present online on these markets than to send the Federal League team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the FIFA football simulation are challenged at the level of competition.
For the longest time, as in normal sports, lays have established in which the professionals attack each other.
And in the 2022 Asian games, E-Sport is already part of the official programme.
But is it a right sport at all?
For many, the idea is safely commonly needed.
Ingo Froböse has also been discussing the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive capabilities, technical and tactical understanding and quick response capabilities.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and care for nutrition.
"The fitted player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping becomes more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
The scientist stresses positively the high integrative effect of E-Sports.
The players are internationally on the way, that is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of corporate advice Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth to e-port.
In 2016, this would have implemented 50 million euros in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
This is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Football League.
However, the E-Sport "is no longer far away from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are already going on.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-Basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and Baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood chess player Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-Wettanbieter Unicrn.
Some things are also happening in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, E-Sport had been introduced as a classroom, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the Football Erstliga Associations, according to Dutt, are now obliged to establish an E-Sport department.
"In the European comparison Germany is backing", explains VfB Board Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgie, and to clarify the old times, is no longer enough today.
It is important to maintain the tradition of the association, but at the same time to establish the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," also says Dutt.
"You can't keep in there that only the soccer remains everything as it always was."
Gift egg ade - The egg-Alternatives for cooking and baking
The scandal of poison-loaded eggs has now been affected by almost all the federal countries.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord have responded and took all the eggs from Germany.
Only eggs are to be taken into the shelves, which proven to contain no fipronil.
Michelle Carter sentenced for the texts that urge Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of condemnation behind grids and five years were exposed to grant.
In June, Carter was sentenced to death by Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is disturbing.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until he was called.
She had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
In red pants and a cream-coloured blossom, Carter stood in the eyes with tears, with folded hands and downward eyes when it was condemned.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken responsibility," she said.
"She hasn't shown any repentance."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "frightening state she regrets".
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that her "old or maturity or even her mental disease has a significant influence on their actions".
A prosecutor read a statement from Roys' mother Lynn Roy, who said there's no day that I don't marry the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will bear with us for eternity," says it.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "consecrated" from the knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children.
"Not to have this only person with whom I was with every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to have a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case attracted national attention after Carters revealed text releases that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Take up, jump from a building, first yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was with his family on vacation.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it to Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murders at her British co-inhabitant in Italy before being released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini lame of the FC Bayern
Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed-Cup winner a great season - Extra-Motivation does not harm.
Something else was on his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the additional clothing was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel new to see, he made the bond assigned to him standing at the arm.
"The trainer hasn't announced it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first use as a Bavarian captain.
Well, the state could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also explain Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen in the professionals of youth players, debutants and just from the holidays, but he was chosen as a playlist.
Sugarl is best distributed to those to whom you have a lot of trust that you want to keep in the mood.
So whoever has been chosen to enter the inheritance of lame can only use a small extra moderation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flyed as a mini lame over the field.
Right behind, that's his position now, the white bond on the arm did her Übriges.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this starting formation like the one who could take the rower the best.
He gave instructions to try to guide the unprecedented troop.
He had the look for it all, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness (cann’t work); Renato Sanches to join on devils coming out to the performance of the Asian voyage (completed only conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to avoid negatively noticed in their first appearance in the Bavarian Tricot.
That worked very well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted sovereignly.
The reputably occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to build up a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped it."
But he also showed a good performance at the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "For this style I was also picked up."
How uncommon this Bavaria world is still for the new access, one saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but certainly gave six or seven interviews.
Kimmich adopted a few cracky statements in the back of his new players.
There he heard of Süle an interesting sentence: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
With Bavaria you just have to win every game."
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB Damen
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB-Damen
Austria's most famous footballer has reported himself about Twitter shortly before the game and desired the ÖFB Damen everything good.
The Bavarian-Legionary is almost a member of the team of ÖFB-Captain Schnaderbeck and is cheated with our ladys.
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation sprite.
The famous Bavarian Dusel might also need our ladies.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Pfälzische Minister: Economy praises Wissing's Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs of the People's Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on TV request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trierer Company Association (VTU), says: "Wissing picks up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked".
The largest turn of turns sees Natus in infrastructure policy: The closure of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan fixing procedure, until 2021, to stand the building law.
A role in the plans of the country also plays the western turnover of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Road Plan.
The aim is to operate the route in December 2020, says ministerial speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a way in which to support regional but international competition companies.
The Industrial and Commercial Chamber (IHK) Trier, as urged by Wissing, strives to use a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have fallen down for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, IHK praises.
The Chamber of crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master-Bonus, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A 1000 euro premium is planned for the master test and 2500 euros, if graduates make themselves independent within ten years of master training.
The list of houseworks for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction it is fast to create facts, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Business Director of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to set Wissing mobility in the country's operation, only 29 jobs have been occupied.
The IHK demands that more orders be made to external offices.
CDU-Fraktionsvize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country as it wants to remedy the deficiency of professionals in the region.
In addition, the previous broadband expansion in the country was nervous.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed the net supply in an IHK survey only with Note 3.4.
They complain about steady Internet connections and breakdowns.
Ex-Economy Minister Eveline Lemke, however, is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the Pro Wind Wind Force Company.
The Green Group left Lemke on April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe, where she had already cleared the field after four months of disagreement.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confronted with a counter-reaction
One day before Audi's announcement, BMW said that it would offer to update the software into more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believed that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", and it referred to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is located, to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday Daimler announced that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a callback.
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit Diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for automotive manufacturers to install installations for the neutralisation of diesel vehicles' exhaust gases also increase, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of hampering the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that were able to comply with the rules when a car was tested but retreated on normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of Volkswagen, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Gionni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be put to court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to avoid emission regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be severely burdened by Volkswagen: The luxury automotive manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the flow on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to join the Isar visitors, tomorrow, a fleet passes through Munich, which has a special message.
When it moves to the Isar on Saturday again, it will see a large flow between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a usual fleet, with Isar tourists.
Especially the construction reference wants to clarify.
On the floor you can see a great info transparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The revelation to a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Where love is ..." the understanding of the Isar should sharpen as a protective wild flow.
Last summer the fleet passed over the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a cautious and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knollennasen and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was once one of the most published cartoon drawings, the knolles of his figures are his mark.
At 85, the Argentine still records and works on a film.
His message: laugh, "for there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he hit himself as a drawing for lucky cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he succeeded at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Once again, the artists of cities are inspiring themselves.
Grosse, circular murderillo graphics drumped in drawings with the Pisa Shape Tower, Big Ben in London and the Red Place in Moscow.
In the early morning, he still sits on the sign table today, works almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for large and small, T-shirts, plumbers and watches continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years he has been working on a drawing film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in its drawings - which has a thousand foxer as a counter-player.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is intended to come to the cinema in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he's more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without any reason.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is decreasing due to the drought conditions and disease-transfering insects, which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers who try to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert on agricultural research at CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "Lavendel in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf ciders, and at very dry weather there are many of them."
And it's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil is not only attracted for vacationers, it is also very demanded for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include better water distribution and slowdown from the soil, but also the spraying of the plants with a protective mixture of tone and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhine celebrates his 1200-year-old existence.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Kraemer, Zünfts, Händler, Vaganten or a Landsknechtslager should be experienced in the city center on these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet in the middle of the week to review their plans for reporting about the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
It was told them that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office that was the goal of an attack with granates in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary to provide perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to be on the list of salaries of the government or the cartel, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest of violence, and while the bodies are housed throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took up his office in December 2012. 589 stand after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven states in this year.
Among the latter are its publisher and inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, Paranoia.
Although a special government attorney was established in 2010 in order to handle the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
As with most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely being brought to court.
At Riodoce, they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are distressing and even though the terrain is still more treacherous now.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all distrust."
On the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot on him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - translated with "Twelfth River".
The shooter ran away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Gerüchte tends to flee around Culiacan freely.
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the topic of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields of the country, as rival groups fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that every day in Sinaloa someone or more people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-story mouse ols for drug kings who are greater than many houses for the living.
For a minute, forget that there is a state of "rest" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is debted that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have angry the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skioske.
The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the defeat of another newspaper who had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroest in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "was it impossible to operate journalism without encountering the noise-gift problem," Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper deserved a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-looking investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
He volunteered to admit that he was afraid.
"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trade in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take over the task you like as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead people ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there always on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his destruction?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and remain alive.
"You don't like it if you're engaged with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their secret start- and landways," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-conservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "Geruch a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. Days before, Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was known to be used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were assigned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a central-class celebration of Culiacan.
Half in the shit, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police, which the governor himself called unconfidence.
It has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where the drug bands are de facto under control.
Riodoce looked at three main stories for this week's edition.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on the public expenditure concentrated on the home city of the Governor.
And there was a group who carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was warned when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite location of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the governing institutional revolutionary party (PRI), which almost throughout the century dominated all political levels.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption for high-care cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local site, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping.
"Before we had already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body structure.
"Now all channels of communication are broken down with our sources."
Valdez's office was converted to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they have never expected themselves: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.
On this day, director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of pioneering journalists and killing them because they said the truth.
Since then, she has asked for the government to recognize her because she is concerned that her anger has injured her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "closed" by organised crimes, government officials involved and an indifference society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug bands, but also on command of politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with the organized crime.
Last year, the "Articulo 19" media watch group has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a disgusting effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas cardell: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to conclude, like the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Break in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartel with a guiding article on the front page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who stay back and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexiko goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on Friday, when the last edition was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the side of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to summarize.
A number of shootings with band rivals and security forces near Mazatlan’s village had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the board, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirenen cried in the vicinity - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept watch to see if they were willing.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose midfinger was visible for all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"However, you can only remember to close it," Bojorquez said, "if the same day, when Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send it to the street for reporting."
Dinosaur used to wipe out his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a frightening.
Researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosauriers".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his delicate skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "uncalm past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described him as "the best-contained dinosaur, which has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil is a newly discovered kind of nodosaurier, who lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the creide age.
His incredibly well preserved state has fascinated researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the fermented fertilizer is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock at the place, and decided to look more closely.
Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years covering the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you're just a little shining with your eyes, you could almost believe it's slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant-fresher, although covered with a armor and similar to a changing tank, was likely threatened by meat-freshing dinosaurs.
The strongly poured dinosaur used a red and white tearton to hide from herbs, and used a shielding technology known as counter-evaluation, also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mix better into his surroundings and to avoid his enemies, experts say what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosauriers has made the first headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent over 7,000 hours carefully covering it.
The amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scraps and armor over his body.
They discovered the contradiction, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although conternation is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the size of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur of sufficient pressure by meat-freshing dinosaurs was hunted that evolution favored the wearing of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use the conternal shade - think of rehearse, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than protein, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Stark robbery behaviour on a massive, strongly planted dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur raids of the creide time must have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life, including its preserved intestines, to find out what it eats as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was driven into a river and driven into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea ground.
At this time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further countryside than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved lush skin but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early creide time.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just shine a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's sleeping."
The creide time was a time when huge theropods, meat-fringing dinosaurs, standing on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, some of his fearful ancestors hunted the panced dinosaur.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest insights appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was invaded in the sea after death and mumified in the mud.
The creation was found by Shawn Funk, when he was found in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-maintained panced dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snout to the hip.
On average, the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch tips that raged from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the pruned fertiliser was swung through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The stoned remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin rests still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as 'sell like a profit in the lotto.
The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stenched remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that wear the skull of the animal.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are sprinkled up.
I can count the shoes on his sole.
In the weather: mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Hard accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Knapp 30 vehicles are involved in a mass caramboolage.
There are numerous injuries, mileage barriers and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), some 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the late Thursday afternoon.
According to first information by the police, almost 30 vehicles, including trucks, were forced between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunder.
There were no information about the exact number of injuries at first.
It's a light to moderate injuries, said a police speaker.
A great offer to rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely locked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backstair was about ten kilometres long.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the counterway - through numerous gaffers.
The firefighter recorded the marks of the vehicle leakers, which now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue scrub was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group testes "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing unquestionably you sit in the train and sleep.
Or one's deepened into his work and just has a generous thought.
And then: Pufff.
Comes the schaffner and awakens an unsanft or rides the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Card control.
But the times of interruptions are over soon.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unskilled driving card control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and evaluate the ticket.
Currently a test operation runs on two routes.
"Come on the offer, we'll expand it.
It will then be expected to be available on many other distance trains in Germany at the beginning of the year," said one train speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" the train calls the driving card devaluation without sheepfner.
In order to be able to use them, however, some requirements need to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers already do.
It must also be purchased by the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And last time you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get to the train, call up your ticket under "My Tickets".
The test customers then appear a button for electronic devaluation.
The train accompanyors receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train accompanying director comes at the place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already degraded online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which is to use the passengers again.
"Who wants to travel through our train personnel without ticket control, simply checks in the DB Navigator itself.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs."
Those who often drive train know that, besides delays and missed trains, the driving card controls are among the greatest troubles.
Because often one has itself, but in any case one of the travellers does not have all the documents that you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the personnel certificate is missing or otherwise a document to be presented.
The result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers, which leads to bad mood in part or large space and delays in controlling your own ticket and at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Still, only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that's only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet fully accessible.
How did an activist learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the one born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stolpered over a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confused as no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed live by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought with herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She left her cell phone to return to Tweets on people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police band and people who cried, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who carried a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a belling dog.
In another video, she said, a different policeman reassured his gun and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"This is not usual," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we used to and we can typically call."
At this moment I felt shaking frost.
I was angry and wept."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, she picked her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from the 11th century.
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and opposition from the viewpoint of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell traveled to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, they talked about a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "over the black experience and the black condition".
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience eclatant racism, she is not different from the next black girl.
I feel that I would prove to her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-approval of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who took lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has changed completely after 9 August," she said, as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on Essential Rights and Health Inequalities in Black Commons.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-regisseurs.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to only "documentate" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Will you document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of human beings, often by white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently said in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-regisseur Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death tract inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary film is not someone who speaks to us or speaks to us. We talk," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because so I will be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant of the film.
As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she loves and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black cheek women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, which marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media after the killing of the black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as a vulnerability.
"Black, slack women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, odd women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women".
However, it is that "this is not an affirmatic type of action", where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity.
"She was the person who excited this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence, although she was at the front, because in a life on these crossings as a black, swearing woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on payment for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the social-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home "A Chaos".
Nevertheless, she is clinging to a song and she feels obliged to this memory since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Traum" to "Sizenwahn": TV readers discuss about bit gallery
The bit gallery moves the people, although it's not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population in favour of and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold scarcely leaves the topic one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While the one say to the bit gallery, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), come from the other side: "Don't use a man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Sizenwahn!" (Lar's Scholz).
While the advocates build on a gallery moving more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the business, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is then bleeding out.
In addition, the gallery is planned just on the property on which the farmer market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work, this will end.
The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - with the opportunity to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farmer market hall for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landwomen are always very happy.
We also discovered the metzwerk for us.
We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer upright.
There are also other cities.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery, the height of the rent comes.
But it is probably not very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "What shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drug or supermarkets: I find it superfluous.
There's already enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.
Because the product offered there is fresh, most of it is offered directly by the producer and is priced above.
As one sees, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer.
Shame, special businesses are almost no longer available and what is left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in to Bitburg.
Especially: Where will the farmer market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the end if the bit gallery actually comes sometime.
Or does the sponsoring bit gallery pre-prepared to distribute all the shops from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It's just not gonna work.
And a shopping center, which is empty, doesn't need anybody either.
I think it would have been better to promote a right farmer market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer market hall, thanks to the mad many - as I find it - don't give any more place to make senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farmer market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."
A suitable similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery room in New York many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticed - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the cuts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst banned a 35-year prison sentence after she made diplomatic reports public on WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable resemblance).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transfrau and dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has sharpened a algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data, even though some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.
Manning, born as Bradley Edward, but since her puberty, has been openly speaking about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the spionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her image was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning is apparently sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In this, the artist produced portraits from strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarettes and gums by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people might look.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at this time and she could not be photographed, so you took up contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her inaugurated museum were to unequal writers who exchanged several letters over two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foretold a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas only a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also a bit deep and strong in the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, second-capable ways to further flourish the rigid splittings that he should actually resolve.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a particular reason".
In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for a end of the "automatic breakdown of which was the basis of sex, race, sexuality and culture" with its overwhelming signature (i in their family name).
On the opposite wall is their mitochondriale DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) were included.
"What people are going to take from it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a private room, is a page from the above mentioned Comic Novelle.
It shows Manning how she appeared in the United States disciplinary cascades like King-Kong with a free-speaking phone.
"If they cold your speech, they won," it says.
"So never hold your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets Philadelphia.
"I still get ganshew when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was foreseen in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, by their own genomic simulacles, which consolidate like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of people," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for killing
A country-wide human hunting is in the process of a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who is searched for as a suspect after a man had been stuck in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Cook County Office show.
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau, 26, died after several stairs.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of the event, and detectives investigate the stings as murder, while the police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been licensed and excluded from the entry into the Campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being examined by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail explanation that "we are in contact with the United Kingdom police and willing to help the U.S. communication authorities in every imaginable way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he urges the suspects to rely on the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a ridiculous tip, saying that something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants: "The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and researching a variety of motifs, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will conclude the WADA road plan in the near future" - the Russian Vice-Premier Mutko
The Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it would not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the plan RUSAD has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA road plan was updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA's roadmap to comply with the code described the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of the organisation.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that might cause Russia to worry.
"Everything has been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list notes that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to allegedly state-supported dopings in Russian sports.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are carrying out the investigation, as our anti-doping system has caused an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no public programmes, and we won't admit something that doesn't exist."
Mutko's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules.
Nobody intends to accept this report without a precondition," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of Doping Controls in Russia during the Doping Scandal in November 2015.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be reused.
Aldi does not sell eggs at first
This was notified to the business groups.
It is a pure precaution that no health impairment could continue to be assumed, said the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negatively to fipronil-containing anti-luede agents.
Aldi therefore wants to produce clarity and transparency with its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's entrepreneurship, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow Whistleblowers to handle C-Suite leaders and to contact the Management Board directly.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees engagement.
Errett said they won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which leaders have low consent results - so that you can rebuild why.
Companies come to see that you need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next uber that has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes a environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this wish for an overview is a lucrative business possibility.
The Global Governance, Regulatory and Compliance Branch could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website of Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and recognise bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber case in miscredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "Puls-" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The public opinion court has recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or acts unethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boykott, employee flooding and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their business centres.
Earlier, if a employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company centre, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now, since the company is using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view in the experience with employment," Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment-judicial disputes."
Company began to take more seriously ethics, values and employees in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations through the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took until the "Social Media came to their right" that companies recognized that you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with returning fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than they have ever been.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only investments.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
investors achieve Renditen when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are employed and engaged.
If the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on the employee engagement by the experts of the workplace culture is important.
However, the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take any action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or at all, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Kotter International Business Management Company, who has seen companies who have too much dependent on the collection of data.
"When you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Have you really heard me?
Do you care about it?
And who don't care about it, why should I?'
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, says Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the team's new exercise fields on the campus.
Some have pulled out their tricoto parts and show the back full of welde from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are subscribed to the summer courses will return to their final audits after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should begin at 19:15 in order to meet the players' schedules already packed.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras's six playtimes in Westwood practice exercises.
They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their appearance against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the regulatory change of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the well-occupied routes of the players.
"We put this enormous burden three or four days on them, and it's very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they punched on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we arrive until Saturday and we have more time, it'll be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, given the clear viewpoints of its fields, will not be a easy task for the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been designed with soccer balls, which have cleared a protection network behind a torpest.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We'll use our security," Mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not much to think that people rent a room there and then try to record an exercise there.
If you have the video tape from an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
I don't worry too much about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third-party fact verifiers and then show their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to fight so-called fake news.
In an opinion on its website, the company said that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and to send them to fact verifiers who may show results of the facts review from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of whom believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French electors in front of the presidency elections overflowed with false stories in May, and Germany supports a plan to be punished after social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hate-filled postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate German declaration that a test of the new facts review was started in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the knowledge that the stories of third parties' facts verifiers are being contested, people want to make more context in order to make well-founded decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test his feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic Romans: A castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a slupfloch for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he sadly says.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' stretches the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I just responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s, who worked for the Jacobiner," he says.
"This is his thumb print!
And letters always smell for smoke, because at that time a fire was burned because of light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he were there.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who has been struck with old papers so that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overreviewed my welcome greeting"), this is all too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyenic heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He wandered through the terrain and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapekeepers, gardeners, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started to write."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as "Hunders of years in which Aristokrates said "Oh, throw it on the roof floor".
Diary books, letters from the time of the English empire, cards representing who had something: "You could think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a Birk to fight the two families.
Boys, let all go of his way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a rebellion that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe they're connected to each other?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the history of the Jesuit patriarch, which the Darrell family concealed for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is represented from the 18th century, inscending his own funeral by filling a ceremony with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his ceremony was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' Loved Family of Scotney: "The Lords seemed to be pretty Gauners, repeatedly make debts and spend money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys, with a talent to recruit inside."
After the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic-Roman over Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has been reclaimed from nature since.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he said.
It was like, "Ach, now I have to finish the fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Mariekapelle in Rhöndorf sheltered
With the coverage of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhondorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roofmark (round show of Thursday).
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret until Thursday.
At the end of August there should be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", the makers of the action have been asking yesterday on the posters at the Rhondorf chapel.
"We don't really think this (naturally!)" they write on their yesterday released website.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
In fact, we are firmly convinced that as a bath Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action concerns more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable all-setting feature."
Finally, she stands in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost an average five-digit amount of its new roofmark and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and transportation in the officer's corps.
That's the same week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine at the Turkish forces a year after the coup.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Board, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
In the discussions, under the Chairman of the Government, the five Vice-Presidents, as well as the Ministers for Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part.
The civilians in the YAS were in the surplus.
The government attracts the troops in the military.
Chief General Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the marine were deposed.
Since the failed coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 Generals and Admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the orders of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, the Erdogan sees as a wire drawer of the coup.
Against 486 people who were supposed to have been directly involved in the coupling attempt, they have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempt to turn as "God's gift" because he gave him the opportunity to "clean the forces completely".
But did Erdogan really handle the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unpleasure in the military quarter".
In the Generalstab there are concerns about an increasing "islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifest in the abolition of the headcloth ban on soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, making great cleansing at the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan fired another 7395 ministers of state, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had toothed the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the actual masters of the country.
Three times, they called for their role as guardians of the world’s government.
After his 2002 election victory, Erdogan urged the power of the military step by step, not least under appeal to the European Union's reform requirements.
Former officers say that Erdogan is deliberately leading to the Islamization of the forces.
The magazine "Vocal Europe" warned a not-named officer who sought asylum after attempting to fight for persecution abroad, that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, such a development could not make the nato cold.
There is no doubt in the alliance after purifications about the willingness of the Turkish army.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "slowed", says Nato diplomas.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for the receipt of visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two Chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US will do to citizens from other countries Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to rehabilitation route for racing shuttle
In the past few months, the future of the racing hut has been fought again and again - it is supposed to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is intended to be built on the marathonal route on which the tourist track is going.
In order to ensure the future of the racing huttle in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, the construction of the route is to begin this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country confesses itself to this important connection for tourism, especially," said the State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of restoring the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros.
From this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future is currently being finally voted, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Tower Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"This is how the plan, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This is why the race booth should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The race-steig-shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between the Ilmenau railway stations and racing platforms in the tourists.
During the past months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by sufficiently many people to order them again regularly in the future.
The route is also strongly built in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it.
Just as you thought it couldn't be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are currently a big thing.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FFR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritated professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founders of the FRR, we have to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, its form of chest wardrobe and the type of fingernail.
"The people are funny about them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will get them even more often," said Mr. Sharkey in publishing his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" its robot according to his convictions and select everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the chest whistles to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more worrying, as many robots have the "persons" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are still the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "abenturely" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," the website of True Companion warms up.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods over the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be "in mood!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subordinate female properties, the performances of rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (hes here: contradictory) Farrah, worry one most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared to a Vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their origin and their increasing raffinity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional allocation.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they will still remain at the edge of the consumer culture.
But what passes through the edge zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market permits them to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has called to attack women sexually.
The most disgusting aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphic images, the swallowed bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically as possible (whether with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, pointed out, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can't separate from their companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are decent slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: Servants
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the incorporation of the healthy human mind
It has become a twist of Trump-Era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. election have also divided families in a small format.
Around Christmas and harvest thanks, there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump’s relatives.
We're all supposed to tighten up to place our filter bubbles.
Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-oriented poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, has visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relativeity with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and very strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is in a further context that this also brings significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the devastating effect of his presidency has the power to move us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the horrible possibility that his girls will no longer dismiss us one day.
However, there is an even more alarming long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalized" which suddenly appear as an incorporation of reasonableness compared to its standards.
Nowadays I find myself attacked by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the crazy one - the dog on the car roof, which 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - which both occur in fact, compared to Trump, as very mild offences.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only spiritually healthy in order to qualify itself as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carussell in the Central Park, the largest of the carussells of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars that can be spent in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are curious and the animals turn to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the Skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city is not justified to the dream.
Five and thirty years later, and I am still not entirely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great circulation in the north of London.
The Central Park Carussell, however, is still a strange magical experience, since here two two years old, 11 years old and two women can go on it in the 40s and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carussell, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, I was forced this week in a storehouse to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% drinking money - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need.
The poor woman in the warehouse was apologizing, while I was tired of the experience of reaching her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved to the hospital with breast pain
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuttings to his wrist, which he reported to the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced against a first death sentence for murder after a prosecutor's appeal.
He killed Steenkamp in the early mornings of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder who concealed himself in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year penalty of Pistorius, which they say to be too careful.
The National Law enforcement Authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger that his penalty will be increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
The last of the Blumberg schools was released from Fützen and Ephenhofen to the holidays and further schools.
Three of the unlocking students will go to the gymnasium in the future, four to the real school.
School director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Biesental citizens' house in Ephenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the Hühnerhof, but will be released to freedom.
In addition, the cousin schar led a musical with the title "The Eagle in the Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it break out by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken kitchen, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain, and slept.
Afterwards, the classes three and four showed a chickenanz in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gockels wearing cylinders for the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (kicks), but it belongs to them.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His determination is to be free.
She wished every fourth clergyman that he felt accepted in his new school.
It followed thanks to the colleagues, the former school director Michael Müller, who repeatedly starts at schooling shortages, and the parents' representatives.
The Kükenzeit is now over, explains class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of schooling, she only disregards her students because it had been a really great time.
Finally, she could rely on the Fourth Clauses.
At the end, all students made a song of summer and holiday time.
There was great joy with the children.
For the new school year, eight first-class students have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, informed.
On the morning of August 1, Sithonia was arrested by the police a group of illegally incensing people, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, while a study is currently being carried out.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have intensified the control of the free camp and impose significant penalties on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should Diesel drivers participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW Group have offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars.
They are aimed at improving the exhaust gas behaviour of cars of Euro 5 emissions classes and partially Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded from it.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe estimates:
Whether the new action is committed
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The compulsory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have drum software," says Anja Smetanin.
The power station (KBA) has arranged its retrofit.
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next months but have not yet specified a precise date.
Daimler has told you to write to each person concerned.
If any inspection is due at all, it will be done in its framework.
How long should the retrospectives move?
"Sheer to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure.
"When we have seen, the car manufacturers have not acted voluntarily on the issue of the environment so far."
How long should the update take?
The transformation itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanin, it is likely that foreign manufacturers would look up.
Does a massive price drop of Euro-4 cars threaten?
The ACE fears this.
But just in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas there are no losses of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prize winners doesn't want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the popular awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) belong to the honours this year.
The awards will be issued at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will organise a reception and join his wife Melania in the award.
The prize winner Lear, known with progressive TV series, already announced that he should not participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times" said: "This Presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to evade them the resources - and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify its viewpoint.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former president John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city alive
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city building champion, will retire in the next year.
The job is already issued - but appropriate candidates are rar.
Wacker has been a city champion for 31 years.
And the work still makes him great fun as he gives him in the press conversation.
He reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he wonders that no application has been completed.
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the nearest possible time.
Thus, taking into account the regular deadlines of cancellation, it is still enough time to work out.
Since Haslach acts as the under-building authority for the administrative community, the applicant must provide appropriate conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they were no longer able to fill them in, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But close to the city and to the city itself is important, says Wacker, who reports about a good business climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years of office, some important projects have gathered to look back on guards with pride.
"We make the city alive," he is sure about the building office and his employees.
But also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla-Areals and the Niederhofenparkplatz has been hit.
The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadiumation is still topical.
Only the latter will make books with around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."

With Haslach's own farm and gardening, it could be responded to many things rather flexible.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is under monument protection as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye on what fits in," when new buildings are approved, the separating city builder emphasizes.
In any event, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end everything is going over my table."
In the case of care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Also that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to provide a final degree as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with a specialized architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning.
The city building office is under construction and underground construction, construction planning, basic acquisitions, management of urban properties, urban farm with farm and urban gardening, and under construction law, including monument protection.
Bike thrown on lines: South Railway locked
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had threw the blue bike from the rail transportation in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The mediators go out of two male offenders and have been looking for them since nighttime.
Near the town of the crime, witnesses were watched a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a Lauzbubenstreik," said ÖBB-speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or the perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and would also endanger trains.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delays and the costs for rail replacements, there could also be pounds of the rail customers on the perpetrators.
Overall, the speaker said that it was a "reverential" sum.
The damages were restored on Friday afternoon, and railways on the southern railways could be led without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had fallen off Friday morning, two of which covered distance transport.
Commodities did not fall out, but they had delays.
According to ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch, some 200 meters had to be exchanged.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help reduce IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products could reduce the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The unhealthy state, which concerns around 1.3 million in the US and in the UK 300,000, causes stomach fights and bleeding, repetitive or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While the affected people are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products to reduce their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that essential amino acid of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in the food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory intestinal disease.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance promotes immune cell occurs in mice wearing a particular bacterium in their injections.
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have made a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a nutrition rich in Tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal intestinal if the same system is active in humans.
Postdoctor Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been separated, had this not.
She suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal robiomas of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the stomach-darm tractor.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenzed and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without they were missing in the mice.
Mouses were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a intestinal robioma and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to un mature immune cells that were isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 milchic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophane levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-based cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach-darm tracts.
It is not known whether Tryptophan-nebenprodukte from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to Tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestinal.
Potentially high Tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "Genie" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic signed a "Genie", Jose Mourinho believes after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last season game before the UEFA super-cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder roll, when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira pre-arranged for popularity.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Preparation Asia tour of the Blues and created only 45 minutes, allowing Mourinho to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lu Kaku started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the beginning of the season.
This week, The Independent revealed that Mourinho wanted three further commitments, but he stated that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfill three of his four priority new obligations.
"Third of four, I thank the association," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made great effort."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved into the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which are several thousand kilometres.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner.
The whole was a persistent test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD-Chef, social-democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Don't blow a storm fire from the party centre, but not a counterwind from the covenant - so was the most important wish of the voters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-regulated capitals.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with the counterwind.
It was deep hits.
And one after another.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once more: red-green can simply not rule reliablely," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising political expedition of a Green Member has brought the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the country day election, his red-green coalition lost its one-stimming majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green-Bundesgeschäftsman Michael Kellner asked the aborted Dutch Green-Deputy Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
The transit to CDU means a clear distortion of the voter's will.
Each Twesten has to return its mandate immediately," said the Federal Business Director and Chairman of the Greens to the Redaction Network of Germany (RND).
"That must not be true at all," says a SPD election fighter, when on Friday morning the new Job's message reaches the party centre.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister-President of Lower Saxony, is there without its own government majority after the crossing of the Green Members of each Twest.
It is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the cousins were calm at his time.
After the Landtags elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
Then it became - and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the diving, the Düsseldorf Pleite slipped the party smoothly.
In the weeks afterward, the coconuts resumed.
Then, when they just made new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next downfall.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country chief, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he sat in the Elbphil harmony while his city burned.
And because he did so much wrong in crisis communication after that.
Since then Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW gas affairs and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
My survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just because in the past weeks, because more and more attempted to put accents in the covenant.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were also not hidden by coconuts in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They were allowed to grant him because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
It is because there is in fact no fault in the inter-party dispute of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz doesn't even.
At times, the coconuts are trying to keep their own rows closed.
Your anger is on the greens, and above all on the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is inaccessible and democraticly damaging, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, Head of Party Links in the SPD-Bundestag fragment, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament, not for her person as a direct candidate, but for the national list of the Dutch Greens, according to the Dutch Member.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestag fragment, complains of an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The electoral will was clear four years ago: The people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate to the Federal Day election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member is distorting the result," said Oppermann.
He asked to clarify the backgrounds.
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU Niedersachsen.
Funds for local ceremonies III
Anyone who wants to clean up his home in the years can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG informed city development on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look at what had happened.
Since 1991, there have been recruitment areas.
At that time, in the renovation zone I from 1991 to 2004, the land Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the amount of funding.
The subsidy was still 60 percent in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016.
For Schindlers, the previous rehabilitations are a "competitive project" - it is ultimately important to promote internal development and not only to adopt new building areas.
On April 4th, the Government Bureau Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The amount of funding amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 from the country, the rest of the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a rehabilitation area now come about?
As Schindler continues to examine where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role to rehabilitation whether there is any interest in the planned area at all.
Where appropriate, the borders could move again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the "Social City" "Bund-Länder" programme, in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of interior cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be implemented objectively, i.e. per property.
The rehabilitation area would finally be defined as a statute.
The authorisation period for the funding has continued until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017.
However, until September of this year, the inventory would be carried out only once, in the context of which a questionnaire to be completed in the rehabilitation area.
In November or December, the statutory decision should be taken as far as possible, so that the renovations can be started in the next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said pre-examines.
It is a matter of assessing the urban misfortunes and choosing when it is renovated and to what extent.
A rehabilitation note will then be entered in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come to receive again and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a significant success factor for the project is the participation of the stakeholders.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent postally to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and landing arch", which concerns, among other things, the construction condition and the rehabilitation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Housing and Housing Bow", information can be made on size, division and residents of a living room.
The blue "business sheet" is only to be completed if business rooms are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a full questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funding functions according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, is commenced first.
You couldn't "reserve" funding for later.
To conclude, photos of the "Ortskern II" project were shown in order to make the attendant a rehabilitation "delicious".
British inventor himself sets a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and wise fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company BioTeq.
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the castles of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the tax.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine hub screw to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers, according to the military data that were left to the TIME Magazine, up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heartpiece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and leading officers of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine, a firefighter from Wisconsin and a fork stapler from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I only wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the deputy marine commander for aviation.
The message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 7 a.m. on July 17th at 7 a.m. for the event at 15 a.m., and remained until the grass was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 a.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of service hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the safety staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time at the plane.
The records made available to the TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits the use of public property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commandant.
"Calls as if you were closed," said the Deputy Commander.
The event "Made in America" was called by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political toptones.
At the event, the President prompted the reform of the health reform in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to terminate government regulations.
The use of the plane known as Marine One or Air Force One for political advantages is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But to demand their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft performed taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled by the show "Made In America" - which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often run training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to stop the US presidents in the White House with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 performed 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said one official.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for "non-presidentship support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the load for none of the other requirements presented at the event.
A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exposing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not hold budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly rates of the US Defense Ministry for the financial year 2017, the DoD Refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24.380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit indicate the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
"Determine the cost of taxpayers based on the estimates for refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual resources."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At this time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things produced in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of contributing to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked intimately.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour through the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and shattered with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before clever task
The second tennis-bundesliga's top rider takes place at the table-third Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss arrives in Kiel at the table-third Suchsdorfer SV tomorrow from 11 a.m.
In spite of five parties, the top rider of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga has still received the sense of reality.
Team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent in any case.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Just on the back positions I find the team very good."
For class and stability at the Searchsdorfer SV, the imports from the high north are particularly important.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to interventions in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olees, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's getting hard for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The New Team for the Trip in the High North is practical.
His debut for blue white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the current Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella active French is not the Federal League party, Zdenek Kolar (Czechia) plays at the tournament in the Czech Liberec to his first service in this season.
The unsieged Chile Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the white tube Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and Julien Cagnina Belgium.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who in January 2016 was the number one of the junior world rankings, someone from the trainer's board around Marius Zay fills the box.
How America Can Damage the OMV
Donald Trump did not work happily when he put his signature under the law for raising sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
"In his possession of defining the law," the Congress packed a few "constitutional regulations" in, he added.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels shook against the U.S. preamble.
After all, the draft proposes to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, it has been distressed to investors of the OMV, which, together with other European companies, are co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Director Nord Stream 2.
The threatening scenes are powerful.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to raise the sanctions by executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at what the group could defense and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is centered in the hit series of Netflix
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix is not over for a long time.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show.
With the third season, DEA focused its attention on the richest organization of the world's drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
Followed by four powerful paterns, they operate "such as a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published Trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type, the American and Colombian law enforcement authorities invite to support the war against drugs.
More new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role Back: The city represents 46 cuisine assistance
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again.
With fixed contacts for the children and a assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban children's days.
On 1 September, Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban children's day facilities (Kitas) again in own reputation.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Director in the Department of Youth Assistance, this is a good message: "We all have been very pleased."
Cooked continues outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates in the Krefelder area 46 children's days, in 44 children get a warm meal for lunch.
During the last Kita year, 2800 children were sitting on the tables each, and the need grows steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 weeks at Kita at noon," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care, if children stay up to 14 a.m.."
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from September 1st: they heat the food provided, supplement them for salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give the food out, clean, washed and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," Pommeranz says.
The size - there are two-groups as well as seven-group facilities - decides about the hour range.
"The cuisine helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," Pommeranz says satisfied.
"So they are much stronger involved and it is easier for the kita line to implement educational concepts."
It also concerns: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team was useful.
For the kids too.
"They have a well-known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - to date also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and cuisine service - has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, also demonstrated the charm that it has expressed in the cost comparison between the city's own and foreign gift as the most economical, it is from the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are re-adjusted.
"But these hours do not fall so much into the weight of about 750 people in the education area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, official head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidateed at the Council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Choices can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and included in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the Province Council and the presidency elections take place on 5 April.
The Talibans have published threats against a election process that relates to the transition of international fighting to an advisory role.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were supposed to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.

Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the phone and necklace of the girl, but what was wrong.
The duo fled without a cousin.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.

GMB concern about investment in the McVise factory in Glasgow
A trade union wishes to ensure the long-term commitment to production in its work in Glasgow at managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVisie.
GMB Scotland said that the company had been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the work, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities would change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie's calls on "to express concerns that financing for the modernisation of production lines will not be driven forward".
GMB-Senior Organisator Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross from the General Site Manager concerns our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and labour forces have concentrated strongly on the local community and Glasgow, an important pillar for man-worthy employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline, the east end of Glasgow urgently requires a flourishing production presence at McVisie".
A spokesman of Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continuous commitment in employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies working in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic climate, we are constantly checking our businesses - and that is true for all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross location, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this."
Did the PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not be slowed down in her persecution of Neymar after she has made a bid of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the World Record Survey?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand, while Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season.
After the termination, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world's highest-paid professional sporter. PSG offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry with the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan Board is that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the soccer world, three years ago, warned by the PSG president of this view?
When Manchester City was interested in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll be opposed to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish association expressed interest in Marco Verratti's PSG middle field player at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prices for Neymar.
Roller discarded and damaged
In the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown perpetrator has deliberately overturned a roller in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and set up cheese damage to the car's garment of more than 200 euros.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for instructions.
To an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Reade, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car came to meet him on his trail, the driver of a VW Touran had to wipe out and touch the guide board.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau on the way to Reade.
In the area of Stolzenau's localization, a car came to meet him on his trail, so that he had to evade to the right.
The touran driver touched the boards.
On the car there were damages.
The driver of the incoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had taken over a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident damaged person, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau at Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Popst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases emits Pope-Bruder Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the candal of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church", said, after publication of the German press agency, he expects from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritated Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regrets about their own submissions or their then false assessment of the processes.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized that "two measure" was measured in the reporting on violence in the camouflages.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "Grad median manipulation" is noticeable, according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think that as normal," writes Scaraffia.
In the interview with Bavarian radio, Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said: "You like to go to the church and this is a found meal."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "beats were a very normal educational means" "to get finished with frozen children, as I was one."
They find it unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, Pope-Bruder Georg Ratzinger often also appeared.
Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial band "My brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was charged by the Diocese of Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburg camouflages were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 camouflages.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "So it can be found that in many cases the Domkapellmeister R. has applied forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases despite violence, even positive memories to him."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the Candal of Missours at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is in his opinion relieved.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "experiences of violence practice in protective orders at the Regensburg cathedrals", gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerician and perfectionist who became more handful when a camouflage did not bring a musical top performance.
How do you as his biographer get this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it.
Eight pages are just devoted to him, and he is clearly freed from any suspicion of intermediate or interchange in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
Violence excesses at preschool also occurred outside its efficacy.
In any case, it can be suggested that he experienced it too late or that he did not take first arguments seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as - as literally - "resolution", "himmel" and "better world".
Thus, the wide majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also represents a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warmhearted", "beloved", "upright", "competent" and "consensive", as an extremely kind teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and bonuses and "always of grapes of children".
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to anger outbreaks.
The fact that he not only kneeled with chairs and threw the key bundle on the ground, but also spread ears and pulled all too freaky boys at the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, regreted deeply and apologized for it.
However, for his rescue, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers.
Do you still know such discipline methods?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I've also experienced this in a worldly school, a state gymnasium.
Compared with what is actually in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and violence excesses in pre-school, this is, of course, a bagatella.
There one is wondering whether it doesn't have to do with his acquaintance and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just crashed on him.
On the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still eagerly working away.
But the truth is: The report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a lot has been reported in connection with the report on the subject of misuse in the Regensburg cathedral.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any incorporation or exchange in terms of sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claimed to have been entrusted to the cathedral champion.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never trusted to talk to my father or my mother about it," said a person concerned, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in clarifying sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.
If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir conductor who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a certain way.
How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in the cases of abuse evaluate?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed student put it in this way: "In addition to sexual abuse, I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely insights and could have stopped the respective offender.
I think it ... also really absurd to assume that it is for him to be ... Buben have opened more intrusively or more clear or even more than to their parents, board leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex ...--unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the clear outcome: "The fact that students and/or their environment were in charge of him in advance, could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation".
As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any exchange.
He can't be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to the advertisement.
There is therefore no reason to communicate his good name with these distressed crimes, as happened in some cases.
In the media, a lot of "Governedxzessen" was read at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former cathedral champion Georg Ratzinger is proposed in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge meal of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of cathedrals, between sexual abuse and violence excesses and, once, other accusations.
In addition, the report has been discussing incidents since 1945, also from four decades where Georg Ratzinger was not head of the cathedral.
The entire horrible pruning pedagogics, the cases in which boys were regularly shaken by sadistic teachers and painted and suffered from them, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have ruled.
But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys faced when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the theme "preschool" was tabu.
One was happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and even "paradise" conditions for many.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: While there was discipline, there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even connect positive memories with him".
That's what remains the accusation of watching away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which the preschool conditions reported him.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just started to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the Witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again at 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger close in front of the conditions consistently the ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, because he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces in 1989.
In that he pointed to this "that in preschool the punishment is continued to be practiced".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when penalties were long forbidden in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal gray zone, as everyone of us still knows.
There was difficult to estimate for him, where the affected people might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible border had actually been exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always look out.
It's just not true.
Only in 1980 was officially abolished the punishment of schools in Bavaria.
Forstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians speak of the "Fallstrick des Anachronismus", i.e. the danger of assessing pastes according to today's moral standards.
That's what the prince's right.
Of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and also not to what has been broken down in preschool in contradictions and violence to innocent children's souls, that is far beyond the usual at that time.
It's all very terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger because all of this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. ears and ears were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was banned, he also strictly kept it.
What picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger presented in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the subject of punishment also a matter of speech?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedicts XVI., tells from his perspective, the cathedrals played only one side.
Nevertheless, I don't forget that he was conducting a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without the need for absolute discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to form an institution of world rank, true cultural messengers of Europe and his musical tradition, from the former nationally known Regensburg cathedrals, which went on tour in the U.S. (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and Bonbons alone, one of the contradictory boys now does not have a large singer and any success, in whatever area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what kind of a person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Due to the work on the book and beyond, I really knew Georg Ratzinger very well and always experienced as a wonderful, humorous, ground-good, deeply believed and heartfelt people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could also do something to do with a fly.
I regularly get with how many former cathedrals still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he once was strict to them are clearly in the minority.
Most cathedrals are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, surely that may be - but he was also a lovely respectful person to whom they still look up and worship them just today.
And please, once again, quite clear: everything that you throw to him is educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be happy that we have overwhelmed this time.
But it is very unjust to make a man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a median sin bok.
There is the evil intention that stands behind, only too obvious.
Because the report, which was just published, is relieved.
Now, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great earnings and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps still in Germany, no one would finally know the Regensburg cathedral patents.
