The horse is in the forest.
More coffee, please.
Who is that woman?
I'll accept your offer.
Do you understand what he says?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where does Tom eat breakfast?
We carried out that plan.
You should have attended the meeting.
If there is, you can read my letter and correct the mistakes.
My conscience plagues me.
Several homes were washed away with the flood.
Why should I care about them?
Does your friend like tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sick fold a thousand paper cranes, her wish will be true.
Tom forgot clean of them.
Don't be late for the train.
If you find something you're good and what you enjoy, it's a wonderful thing.

Tom better didn't do that.
She's very beautiful.
I don't want to meet her.
I don't know where we will finish.

Can I overcome later?

Sami repaired it last week.
What should we do about him?
The food is right.

Thank you very much!
She looked beautiful.
We all go.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.

I went back to my seat.
Close the door behind you when you leave the room.
There's always something to do.
I'm going to be on the next bus.
Money cannot buy happiness.
Who said that? It's quite wrong.
Your name is first listed in the list.
Is that necessary?
Can you wait so long?
Were you busy yesterday?
Sami hates talking about money.
My sister is beautiful.
With the sun, they left their work.

I'll have to come back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I wouldn't be surprised.

In the past, the boys were taught to defend themselves as they were very young.
Tom would never have done that.
There's a bird here.
Wait, don't shoot!
I wouldn't blame Tom.
It was his decision.
I didn't really want to win.
I'm no longer afraid.
I hoped we could become friends.
Tom trembles.
My grandfather made his own furniture.
He does not like traveling by plane.
We really have nothing to lose.

Does that make sense?
I don't want you to change.
Even Tom lied.
His music is known.
It's all yours.
He belongs to Catholic faith.
I don't want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his thoughts.
I'm not going to change my choice, don't matter what you say.
That is pretty normal.
I love your son.
Tom will not appear at all.
I must have imagined myself.
Let's practice.
It was hard for him to hide his pride, which he felt after his success.
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said that he had not kissed Mary.
The bell rings.
I can't get out of this cell.
I have no time for you.
They said that they had always done so.
My boss was satisfied with what I had done.

I want to be her girlfriend.
Don't move.
I heard of him.

You're not a dog.
What would you have done if you were in my place?
I'll be right behind you.
Tom went back to his car and took a flashlight.
I think I may be out of a job.
I said Tom I'll be now.
My son still believes in Christmas.
I hate driving.
Sami has to wait a little.
Are they friends?
Tom knows everything about them.
It is dangerous to enter that area on your own.
Sami did not notice that.
Do you wear gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my father, do you?
I'm now back with refreshments.
That's why I'm here.
He's my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel looks forward to the lake.
Tom’s hands were cold.
She is capable of reading.
It appears that he knows the secret.
Do you have a mobile phone?
Mr. Mitchel gave me to overpaid the rest of the money before the end of the week.
She killed herself.
You're not a doctor.
I know how you felt about us.
She's younger than he is.
I put it back where it belonged.
I'm taking a book.
Tom left his phone in the car.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I keep dreaming about her.
Tom did not wear socks.
Tom will say no.
I'm a fireman.
There are islands in the sea.
Where is it now?
We are not very hungry yet.
There is probably an easy solution to your problem.
I completely forgot about her.
We must begin to do that.
It is expensive to live in Japan.
I know how you feel about her.
I drank two cups of coffee.
I forgot she was clean.
Tom, but it was unfair.
I don't want to marry.
I care about him.
Tom may die.
If you rise up, he will be studying.
I have a dry skin.
We are his sons.
Birds are beautiful.
The fighting lasted for a week.
When did you last laugh?
Tom's not going to have a talk today.
Why did you join the army?
I wouldn't blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You're too late.
What we know about health has taught us through the study of diseases.
Tom sits at window reading a book.
We will not be here after 2:30.
I like eating meat.
I could do it by 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Does Tom know how to dance?
Did you call him?
He's kicking me!
She read the newspaper every morning.
The bakery is slowly the slaughterhouse.
Please, forgive me.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
The food did not taste so badly.
I eat rice.
Excuse me, may I open a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
It rains.
Tom will be late.
I dare you to bridge that farm.
I bought only a few new shoes.
We want it back.
The game starts tomorrow.
They can conquer their fear.
This can't be a real diamond.
Tom moved away.
Was Tom there?
My father has recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my umbrella.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories from my parents.
Tom will no longer get help from Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I'm to fall in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
It doesn’t matter what he says, do not trust him.
You must have visited Kioto.
I got up when it was still dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we should have thought about him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008, a year later, we married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
Late in autumn, when the weather was rough, windy and wet, and the cold could enter the thickest garment, especially at sea, a poor boat with only two men sailed into the sea.
At night, all cats are grey.
Stiller!
It's my house now.
A bird flying.
He arrived 30 minutes.
He stretches out to a English-Japanese dictionary on the desk.
Whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
I wish you said it before.
I love my mother.
Tom will not object.
I'm much greater than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your dad.
You'll pay for it.
I have a place to keep looking for.
Tom had a lot on his board.
Do you choose red or white wine?
This is the next!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot her cleanly.
Japan is full of beautiful cities. Kyoto and Nara, for example.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are this?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat what you want.
It's really nice!
The river flowing through Parrys is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
