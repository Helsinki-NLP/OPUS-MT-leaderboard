No liberative novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused to abolish paragrafs in the context of a novel of the criminal law, on which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned.
The new regime, which could have evolved the way to the exile of the prisoner minister, rejected the Members in the second reading of the application for the reduction of the penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October because of the conclusion of an allegedly disadvantaged contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet valid, and in December the appeal of the convicts is to be negotiated before the court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West the process caused the suspicion of the prejudice of the court.
The request, Paragraf 365, on the basis of which the Minister of Expedition was sentenced to remove from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of libyan libyan libyan libyan rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As this region is commonly conquering Islamists in the elections, the question is just what - the moderates or the radicals.
The National Transition Council knew about the customary law of the Scharī
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for stealing, one is hacking off his hand in a short way.
Women should also forget fastest thoughts of emancipation, possibly apostates of faith, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will in the future be united by the Koran from each other.
In short - in Libya, there will be an order that would hardly be imaginable in this country and, above all, it would not be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle isn't the only and objective one, probably not the best one and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
So it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters at all have been helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To apologize, it may be only the fact that the air attacks of NATO were guided by Allah himself, not by any general from America, but by every success.
The winners in Libya?
We only participated in a change of shots, served the interests of Islam and our politicians, detached in the person of the dictator of a political allies, without having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we would prefer to avoid a military occupation of Libya.
This leaves the Hies anxiety, namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But will the mineral oil companies also get the black gold at the spot price without occupiement?
It is hardly and so the West can at last at the right of its selflessness in the field of protection of human rights.
If they do not destroy the Scharī北a representatives.
Beginning of a new crisis-arah
France and the rest of Europe focus on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm depth was blown by Europe.
The individual States published their information on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the prequartal, Germany and France.
However, the bond market is rising all records today.
The investors not only keep in mind Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries now.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, which of France was 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded a higher growth than originally expected ( growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decline by 0.1% (original data only spoke of stetagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the pre-quartal, the gross domestic product stagnated, and according to Tsch. Statistical office thus confirmed the trend in growth slowing economic performance.
So the results are worse than the forecasts of analytics.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, compared with the previous quarter.
According to premature and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Throughout the euro area and the EU, between July and September, the economy recorded a growth by 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to the analytics' expectations.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from its 10-year-old government bonds clarified the value of 28.45%.
The return of the Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also begin to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, votes will be loud, the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro, they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualifications for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-established Torwart Čech and a magnificent gate of Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football could thus defend its luxurious advantage of the home game and will not miss once again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the rising game in a detailed reporting.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happy 1:0 thanks to the final weaknesses of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus triggered their ticket for the footballEM.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they put the Montenegrins under pressure only in the second half.
The birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be intervened in the European Championships next year. It is also delightful that the local football has a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes on, fairly fighting football was played.
Both teams combined long and thus was played around the middle line in particular.
Also in the second half, the pressure of the home team remained, and the wide downfall in front of the penalty was successfully defended by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for the core programme of their country.
They formed a living sign.
Some hundred university students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday noon before the object and then announced the death to the US and Israel.
On Tuesday, a few hundred students from the University of Iranian Isphahan formed a living sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where Uran is processed.
They wanted to announce that they were willing to protect their country's core program, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran seemed to have not given up all its efforts to a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed to the complex in the afternoon before the entrance and then announced the death to the US and Israel.
In the event of an intention to put the Iranian nuclear programme widely lame, the Israeli press from the centre of Isfahan would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's target.
The menu of a fat-sufficient child: It's not breakfast and eating for the evening bread Wurst
More than one third of the children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys proved - adipous children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important it is for the healthy development of a human to grow up the environment and to be the examples that surround it.
On the tables of adipous children, worms are up to half more frequent on the table than in families where normal weighty children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had on the day before the education action under the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence" pommes for the evening bread.
In families with thickeners, sport is not just one of the favourite jobs, but also the majority of today’s students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find at least once a week time for active movement.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year and nearly 900 children from primary schools were interviewed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Case and Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy cost and lack of family movement are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, suggested five times a day, in the mode of breakfast-second breakfast-member Vesper-Eventbrot - one of the main requirements for healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for evening bread
Experts point out that also relative minorities, such as the family's regular breakfast time, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families were breakfasts.
And - in most families everyone breakfast for himself.
The worst was the finding that in every tenth family isn't being frozen at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the foundation of healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children a lot of unhealthy pounds are consumed.
And almost everyone - without regard to weight - drinks sweet limonads every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Make up your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own food plan from opportunities offered according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in puncto diet is far away from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many meals, meat dishes and, of course, sweet food.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet limonades," the final report on this survey stresses.
During lunch, i.e. the main court, doughwars conquered just before poultry.
The children almost didn't like chicken fruits, and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunches was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get right information.
"In the control group of the respondents who completed the questionnaire after the clarifying lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence", a significant shift in preferences to the principles of healthy diet was quoted in the results of the project.
This was obvious, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to predominate ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed a lot of poultry or fish as the main court of the day and were willing to eat less necklace or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how to learn stylists, I had melted a bit that was a bit too much material for the beginning.
I didn't know anything else.
Lectures from three professionals from the industry, clothing problematic figures and a seminar on how the "in the place" runs.
It's gonna be worse.
The closer the test gets to more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we debated with director Alena (no single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideally proportional figure.
And that's the most of us.
The one has one too short neck, the other one too young with no decent curves and others are mollig.
It is a matter of the stylist to optically cushion wide shoulders, extend the neck or shaping the necessary curves.
We also received tips on how to attract a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - with big buses, broad hips and narrow waist - pretty and figurative, without being all too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the rock or pants really do not fit, at least one piece should be cut by measure.
You're sure not gonna regret that because well-sitting clothing is simply unpaid.
In such a tailored rock, one feels much better than in one of the rods, which is always too high and shaved, in the waist, etc.
Youthful figures can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, constructions, applications, embroidery or raffing.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am happy that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
Still, I'm afraid it's almost impossible to work in the face of the enforced homework.
Each of the course participants was assigned a promi for which she should think of suitable outfits - day clothing and evening robe.
We should take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the corresponding star and its type of figure.
I'm supposed to attract Miranda Kerr, which you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than attracting Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent years (now well, that is a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the clothing out of magazines or search, print, and then process graphically on the Internet.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is mentioned, our very personal style and our relationship with graphic design is to be expressed.
After all, it is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (for example, trend-handbags, males, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about that.
But it's only Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday presentation filled with information about figure types was equally seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, by the fashion creator Jakub Polanka and by the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to use this out.
And embroidered stylist can work with a single clothing piece in a very different way.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat like usual over the jeans, that is, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to crawl the sleeves or crowns up and the whole look look looks quite different.
"play it," he emphasized.
But most of the advice came to me: "You have to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you may hurt her," said Jacub.
Finally, I realize why we need to paw all these teaching sets, what can be combined with something and why, even if you often get to see quite different things in fashion journals.
To be silent from fashion views.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you need to be prepared for a Fashion Story with ten pages (speaking ten outfits) to styl at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to expect all of this in the design of the outfit.
The fact that the image and style sometimes represent half of the success, this also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
You just need to see Madonna a not really brilliant singer from which image and marketing made a world star.
In the Czech Republic one is more reserved against the services of a stylist.
Even well-known personalities often think this is outcast money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look out is second-range).
And if somebody can be styled by us, we should expect that he or she will probably impose us on a different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to google to determine with certainty that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has resumed or decreased, etc.
On Sunday, Jan and Mario urged us not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "construct" the outfit.
In his work, he must communicate primarily with the people he is styling and he must be a woven psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering themselves and standing for his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to see her clothes cabinet and to add nice pieces, then we can't clear her all the closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to which you recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us precisely what such a so-called "plate pocket" must include.
So such a bag that is knocked to the waist and wearing all the necessary proprietaries.
In addition to such clear things, such as scissors, scissors to remove hair or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (that helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothing is reaped behind if it is too large (stage needles or other clamps are forbidden so that the substance is not broken down) and of course sewing.
But not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to underpin shoes properly.
When photographing in the studio, where the floor is just, you can damage the shoe sole, sweat the outside.
We were sticking and sticking...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors, so you can't damage them.
So you really need to do it skillfully.
Mario pleased me by commending my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was only the fraction of what we were hearing at the second weekend retirement course.
One thing has become clear to me - devoting to styling at a professional level is not a game of children.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original careless ride becomes completely avoidable, dilettant error for routine riding to the early layer.
Although the ambitions have been fulfilled for a large part, what does that help if no one obviously liked to do a little more?
Before he came to the shop table, the new part awakened high expectations with the subtitle "The Run".
He promised to move the game series "Need for Speed" again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples, he did not seem to be just one of many action race games.
We were also curious about how the fitted passages appeared in which the main protagonist rises out of the car and goes on foot.
But as you've been used to NFS, the final effect is much different than you expected.
Sure - potentially there are quite decent acade races, but as a whole, the game is smashed by some excess mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So there are actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of an incomprehensible faulness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race-separation across America.
In San Francisco, then on the west coast, you are going to get to the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty races.
This means that each race is carried out on a different route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You have no moment the impression that game would offer the same again and again.
Some environments are still quite beautiful, although the technical level of the graphic does not go beyond the previous parts of the series.
So nothing to do with the world.
But the ride through the desert, through autumn landscape or high above through deeply snowy landscapes looks very pleasant.
On and off, untypical elements bring a little variation into each race.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that strongly limits the view.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be obscured that you are not thrown by a lawn.
In addition, the individual races are well built in each other.
It's just a few, but they're rich.
For a while you try to overcome the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have to pick up time (classical race against the stop clock), then you expect a personal duel with a single counterpart.
And that's what the police's gonna do to mess the whole thing.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is rather about some interactive animations in which Jack flies from someone else and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprised, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than one would expect (most likely only three).
Finally, this is more advantageous, because this element has at least no chance to become boring - it belongs in the context of the above said elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model takes place in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That means, seen from today’s point of view, although it does not break out trees, on the other hand it could not be claimed that it would be bad.
Those who are looking for realistic simulations have to look around elsewhere.
But an action-loaded race will continue to be well justified by the local driving model, even though you can find better in competition.
Until then, everything's in the best order.
Real problems occur only after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
Of a game of this kind it is hard to expect that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no impact on any object know how the car is, then obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: In the case of tight overtaking or precursoring on adjacent cars, in some places the other cars are only easy, but in other, almost identical situations you get into the sludge and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the cars drive to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this doesn't matter any further, it's always angry.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the route, then you throw the game back to the last point of direction of the route.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
If you put it out, everything's going on from the front.
So the restarts are rather like a tool, in case something is not successful, but you should not leave on it.
Sometimes, however, does not even help the restart, there is nothing but helping to learn the critical section out of the head.
Excellently uncomfortable is that the same things are often happening in the same places.
For example, some curves have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Otherwise, "civil" cars are always encountered in the same configuration at the corresponding point, no matter whether they are the first or the fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially angry when you see that the contrahent passes before a playing on two incoming cars, but until you arrive there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to circulate or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is so designed that this situation is always close to your nose.
The counterparts have further advantages.
There are a few places in the whole game where one is always overwhelmed by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
The most crazy thing is to finish the game on the long bridge that is happening in opposite direction.
The contradiction must obviously get one out of here on Devil.
And if he's already before, he's taking a view of one, of course, so you're driving your own car there at first a few times in Klump.
Clearly - one just wants to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly rents the joy of the game.
And that's bad, because despite the simple driving model, the game is quite entertaining and, instead, also so action-loaded that one almost no longer knows where one of the heads is.
And in principle it doesn't matter what "schuld" is - the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of races in a way that no boredom can occur, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars in the course of the race.
You should not overlook the gas stations on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient that you just have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousins for the straight motorways and exotic super-sports for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game history mode also goes the task mode (requirements) - so the races in the individual localities you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is jointly for the tasks (requirements) and history.
To reach the higher level of drivers, different items must be unlocked: starting from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously linked to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares its own results with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of further incomprehensible cutters is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get to a subway tunnel (mean road) where you're racing on the rails long in the dark (mean road).
On the Tacho, digits between 150 a 200 km/h (meaning paths), but at once, a subway comes from the back and drives a compromiseless to scrap.
In our editorial process, we will probably be fighting for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designer or whether the authors think us so stupid.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
The more annoying is that at some exciting moments, the frequency of the video is slower and sometimes quite dramatic.
In particular, however, this concerns the accidents with a larger number of stakeholders, where a continuous FPS does not use anything at all.
The sound reproduction is so far O.K. and the soundtrack is taste.
In trying to address a young audience as wide as possible, a soundtrack a lá was created "of everyone" - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game would not be weakened by the total unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have believed with the breasttone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game works unfinished.
A great pleasure for yourself, but you should be prepared to look at these mistakes with the power of airport vouchers.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and euroscepticians
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance among the individual institutions seemingly out of the lot."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to be burned."
"It will take five, six years until the wraths are smoothed and all are used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador at the European Union, quite sharply her lecture at the Legal Faculty.
How seriously she takes the motto "Scientific and openly about Europe", she already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a overviewable and understandable way that they could have afforded such a reader of the Faculty of Law of the Karls University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At the beginning, criticism became loud that he was too inconsistent - a grey official who had not grown such a role, but I have to say that it has defeated all the breath as well as he has accepted the matter.
"He is a person who is able to listen patiently to seven and twenty Member States, to communicate with them and, above all, has clear ideas about how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, she then explained as an answer to the question: who is that actually - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, as an important step towards the unification and better readability of the EU policy towards States, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our oil-moved quargels
Ms Vicenová also devoted to the agenda in which the European Union lived and intended to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago referred to it as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the presidency referred to it as a major negative one which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently full of its hands.
The ambassador said that it was not only at the presidency, but also at the subsequent crisis that has not been overwhelmed until now.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes the matter much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and spare budget, which will be the priority of the sectors, which countries will be more and less promoted - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Scientific about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then there's horrible shortcuts, foreign words, and professionaljargon that no one understands.
How should I, as a citizen, actually know whether we really think about the crooked or round cucumbers and various large bananas in Brussels or whether we really want to ban the quartz.
It would also like to use the EU soil to get more Czech people in European institutions.
Europe of the two or different speeds in view
According to the EU Ambassador, the Czechs are calling to be Euroscepticians who are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is more annoying.
Many factors are responsible for this, including the retention of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Do you believe me when a pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the French next to me says: "Hey, what are your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and there is a pretty sour mine.
According to Mrs Vicenové, in the future, the EU expects hard rules for the budget policy of the Member States.
As much more realistic as a "European Federation" it sees the concept of a Europe of the two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the euro area and the countries outside the euro area here.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Strengthened Cooperation."
"First of all, it was said that only the countries who want to work together and those who don't want it to be quietly away."
"There will be more and more of such institutions, which will end up with a strong Europe of different speeds," Ms. Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, which states that all the issues with effect on the whole of the EU must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the euro area countries.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters into the second century of his existence
If you wanted to search for an appropriate word that the strategy of IBM is the most accurate, then this would probably be the word "Langleness".
For the wide public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although since its foundation has been abandoned for a century.
The basis for this longevity already laid her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He already represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems were easy to solve when people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a brand mark to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the business culture prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century, because it remained faithful and did not pretend to change everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society throughout our first century.
We hope that we will create more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company from the occasion of the anniversary.
Translucent system
In the thirties, Watson worked social care for his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Baya in Czechoslovakia: The IBM staff had paid holidays as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as a workwear and a thoughtful remuneration system for best newer and dealer.
The long-term relationships of IBM with their customers are equally elaborated.
From the beginning, the company was generous in talent support - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM raised any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan is altered at the top of IBM next year by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she took the position of the driver, marketing and strategy chief.
IBM has been making so-called online Brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - ideas are enough, in the company almost half a million people are busy.
An institution with a good reputation
Their immune position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this after interior and outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist Professor of the Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps to solve business problems with technology," added George Colony by Consulting-Firma Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be present on the market only or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logo because of family "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in one century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product wide - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM owns most patents and five of his employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, banking machines, credit cards, financial swap, strip code or the diskette.
With about 220 billion dollars of stock exchange value (market capitalization) IBM was the second largest technology company (even after Apple) this year, and it has been conquering Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The View Prev
Not all products and innovations encountered the taste of customers today - unhappy, for example, were attempting with their own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally bound to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem building its basic walls on different platforms - and if they do not work to leave them again.
In contrast to the counterplayer Microsoft, which is in principle standing and falling with its operating system Windows.
Successful technologies
In the IBM profits, services, software and hardware are largely involved in each one fifth.
In 1990, hardware with more than fifty percent share was the strongest.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-release assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in purchasing future-strong technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time fought like a storm over the world.
Here too IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment in the middle of the major world economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM is without prejudice to today's crisis.
Since 2008, the value of IBM batteries has increased by 120 percent and the company's rein gain continues to grow.
IBM's company log is: everything can be changed - only the values are not.
Therefore, it is also expected that this flexible gigant will also master the next crisis.
IBM History: From cheese cutter to global flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York a hundred years ago had a quite complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM first took over in 1924 - it was originally a trademark name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies, whose history returned to the 1980s.
They owned technologies, such as the famous fast cards for registration of the start of work and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who appointed the Chief of the Competition Company Thomas J. Watson to help him in the management of the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shadow - on Watson's ideas is based on the invincible culture and identity of the company until now.
Watson led the company by 1952.
IBM, began, as the name already tells, to manufacture and sell all possible machines for trade - from worst and cheese cutters, to casses.
In the first four decades in which Watson managed the company, he doubled their sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he had been in the head seat for 40 years, only then he was dismissed by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM of NASA helped to lead flights to the All - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which set the computer standard of that time, came to the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold his computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, she bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCooper and became fully involved in the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy IBM has paid out in the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It emphasizes the intention to use technologies in a wise way in areas that have not been planned, for example, to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which is designed to help dealers lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932 IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia, which was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a top research team of world level that is concerned with the technology of voting recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful gates:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her spouse Joseph Rychtář (53) became their lover by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina continued to hope that Joseph was awakened from his pink dream and came home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of life it has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová of singer I. Bartošová had offered refuge in her own house, she wouldn't even have fallen into the dream of how it was with her husband.
When Iveta retired after 30 days and moved back to ůíčany, Joseph went with him.
Yes, he even publicly knew that he loved them.
With the time Darina resigned, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile her unfaithful husband, but now she gave him the passport.
Rychytář doesn't care with whom his wife sleeps
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not hunt him out."
"Everything, not as a loved, lost old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain bonds," Ms. Rychtářová explained; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated herself from him and is solely on mutual responsibility.
The fact that Darina locked him the back door, Joseph has so far worn with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper-eye and I respect it."
"The company continues, I'll take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I'll make the purchases."
"With Darina I am quite normal, only we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, he wouldn't want to prevent them from doing so.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who is that.
I'm sure that's my fault, I've in love with Iveta, and that's why I take over any responsibility.
The worst female distresses: What about you?
If the men are invited to call some typical female denominators, then they immediately shake some out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines, in which we let a few unsitted ones retire again that let men turn blood into the veins?
Sufficient for shopping
Do you want them to be purchasing?
Do you have to buy at least one Hader weekly?
Would you like to buy in and may it be a little more on actions?
Then, in your case, it really is a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping pleasure halfways under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman already doesn't like to try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin on the search for a well-sitting upper clothing?
Even though shopping for most women is a hobby, for the men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told her husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Sustainable dissatisfaction
"I'm not too thick?"
"I have to take at least five kilos - should I start jogging or gymnastic?"
"I'm going to fall on you at all?"
Is that somehow known to them?
Yes?
Then you may also be among the women who are really occupied with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to let go, but many men react allergically to it when her wife constantly regrets her appearance.
The stronger sex is unanimous - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly incompatibility.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against wind mills.
Put windows, wipe tiles and dust, shy the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Do you shrink with her partner, because he once again tires with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, you shake the children, because the wash basin is already dry again and because the glass door at the living room has already got fingerprints again, where polishing is so hard?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviation", then you should know that you must not overdrive anything and the order and cleanliness in family life are not the first place.
This measureless purity fimmel can ultimately also harm mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Stamps
"Basic turtles come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to dress the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tyre, you should not be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Clearly, that's not badly meant, but they just want that everything has his order.
If the men knew this, the women may not have had to mecker so much.
Clatch and Tratsch
Some women like to knock and snatch, there is shaking behind the back or even slandering or snatching alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to heal such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, every woman of us has a bit of harmless cloth and tratsch in stock.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
However, this is not to be confused with clatters of crude calibres, who are nothing and no one sacred, who probably despises everyone in their surroundings and represents a significant risk especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with their assistance to victory
The ice hockey tower Jaromír Jágr had a large share of Philadelphia's 5th-3 victory on the ice in Carolina during the NHL's assembly game and is thus again productivest Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was called the best player of the match, was used by the overview of the nine-en-thirty-year-old ice hockey stars.
Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček also recorded two assistences in the same game.
Jágr claimed after the game journalists that he prophesied Giroux a great evening.
"Before the game, I tell him that he's succeeding a hatching today."
I felt like that."
"Hin and again gets such a feeling," Jágr said, after whose action Giroux already achieved a gate at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track."
Behind the gate of the Hurricanes, Voráček fought the Puck and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
One second before the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short dealer, but the second third again belonged to the flyers.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr he reached his third match, then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but certainly he's one of the best three," Jágr honored his center.
"I wouldn't have noticed that to finish my career with such a ice hockey player as with him."
"That's great to me."
"I cut my game to me."
"All the years in the NHL my fellow players put their game on me and now the spit turns around," Jágr smuggled.
Carolina made the game to the drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who took part in a criminal ward, came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in over two against one.
"Excellently Pronger still acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up ride and (read) moved to more remote punches."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," described Voráček's last match from his view.
Through this victory Philadelphia sat at the top of the eastern conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured against Buffalo in the game and disfellowshipped in the second third because of an injury on the upper body.
The Candiens also paid their leadership in the Penalty shoot 2:3 alongside their experienced Beck.
One of the penalties could not transform Tomáš Placeanec.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably pained the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defensive players.
"That's bad."
"We finished the encounter with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing to do, we have to finish it," said Jacques Martin.
"On every change, one attack wave after the other, and we had nothing to oppose it."
"We should have made the game easier and put the puck out of our third."
There were still reservations here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech gatekeeper Ondřej Pavelec defeated thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters were involved.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five government travel agencies approved in the then ČSSR: Čedok, sports urist, CKM, Recrea and car engineer.
The travel offices at that time sold mainly travel to the socialist East Block Countries, and in the West there were only chosen ones.
And so, Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia launched a pro-west course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of the socialist times was that not even citizens of the eastern block (also the Czechoslovakia) were allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travels were not possible.
The travel offices already offered travel to the west, but they had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag before the travel office, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel office.
Also, the matter hadn't been running for a long time.
The so-called devisenzusage - the condition for a trip to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would not have been possible to make the necessary financial resources (western currency) for a journey to the West without exchange.
The majority of the Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and Datschen - a habit that lasts until today.
The total revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which one no longer knows today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular Czech holiday country until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia.
As of the beginning of the 1990s last century, foreign exchange obligations were lifted into neighbouring western European countries, leading to a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakia could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
Thus, the Czech vacationers slept on traveling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who had already had the money for accommodation at the hotel or in a guesthouse at that time.
A typical feature of foreign trips from Czechoslovakia was then a full-packed trunk room with conserves, beer and durable worst, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists could finally buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of life and thus the average salaries rose, which coincided in 1997 in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demands for travel, after 1997, travel agencies started to prepare regular travels through charter flights, making flights incredibly approved thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, had already devisenless payments with all the highly developed countries in the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-to-off" travel traffic came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight was made to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, every year, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying far away sunny countries; this year, twelve exotic destinations are fleeing directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually in exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the epoch that characterized our postrevolutionary development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States raised the visa obligation for Czech tourists, which definitively formed our country among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15 tsd for a single holiday, including the cost of the holiday resort. CZK per head.
The General Assembly will find a new Chairman - a patt threatens again.
For almost five months, the Czech football has no chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the top of the Czech football association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary main meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is no agreement on which election order is to be elected until now.
And without this, no vote on the three potential followers is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his role, calling his colleagues on him to agree and find a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era to Hašek, the old crossings between the two chambers of association broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This proved to be very clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People's House in the Prague district of Smíchov for no reason, because the negotiation led to no result, and it was not just about the choice itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the secrecy representatives or also the officers equipped with a power of power.
At least part of this point was agreed, including the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, whose opinion is that a representative on the basis of power is not sufficient.
However, the disputes about the electoral regime continue to continue.
The Executive Committee also no longer put clarity on the agenda at its meetings, regardless of whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else.
Even though the views on the choice changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is: how should we proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a Patt situation?
"The point of dispute concerns whether to deal with the statute or whether to find a different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in the management.
According to a secular model, the third round of the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he candidizes.
Mayors are allegedly willing to agree on the compromise that the candidate is defeating the higher number of votes from both chambers.
In turn, the Czech side is subject to the condition that the winner receives at least one two-third majority at this percentage of vote.
"Then the two rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the whole two-room concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the monetary side, which best find it not to turn the election order, but to choose according to the valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees, even though it turns out that the electoral order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My desire is to be widely chosen after the statute."
"That doesn't make any nonsense replacement variants as at the last general meeting," said the owner (the football clubs) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time candidateed and demarcated in his opinions above all Pelta.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
He believes that the new Chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the footballEM on this day would surely contribute to the calmness of the minds."
"If the soccer only rides on the euphoric wave, it is also more willing to cooperate," says the functionary from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experiences from all three adipes, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl's more reluctant.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately awkward."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Misters, but there are some efforts to "adjust" the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a re-blocking is not excluded at the General Assembly."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human mind ultimately wins," said Rajchl.
Just - a lot of time to agree on all sides won't be left.
Some negotiations are supposed to play directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football genericity will be complete until the qualification game.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance, and so it was searched for a substitute variant, such as to bring some of the executive committee to the barrage play place.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level is probably crucial to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to agree the divided parties within the country's largest sports association.
It is a lot at stake: government contributions, the trustworthiness of the Czech football and also the upcoming main meeting of ČSTV, which aims to show the Czech sport the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is fighting the Chairman's position because he does not see appropriate candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the Chief of the Pilsner Footballer in front of the extraordinary General Assembly, could have made up a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new Chairman of the Czech Republic's Football Association (FAČR), he would not have been involved in the fight for this top position.
"If there were a good lawyer, then I would fight for him and give up the choice."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the Chairman's function only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary General Assembly.
In the Chairman's position, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football events.
"I talked to some people in question personally."
"Come to believe that some told me they didn't want to identify themselves with the Czech football at the moment.
"Solche views would have liked to change," he quoted.
Most of all, Paclík is supposed to disturb the link Pelta's with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, which is considered to be a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegated votes on general meetings.
For Paclík, it is therefore inacceptable that Pelta would have the chairman's position within.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and in the Czech football it wasn't going ahead at all."
"The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, doubled the football bad," said Paclík.
He also recalls that Pelta's name fell in a corruption affair before some time in connection with telephone hearings to determine, however, from which Pelta was unjustified.
"I don't know what prestige should bring a victory of Pelta to the (e.g.) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his former pronunciation, "he will sell the Pilsn football club if Pelta becomes chairman," but a little more left.
However, if Paclík was victorious in the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the General Assembly in October, ended with a fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go."
"He has great abilities."
"I could well imagine him, for example, as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who in September provided attention that he was at the top of the daymar Damková after the arbitration of the Arbitration Commission with Luůěk Macela.
Paclík himself claims that he felt the role of the association chairman grew.
And call on his capabilities in the management of private companies, since last summer he has also been Chief of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the soccer environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"To limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and vocational commissions, which evolves into distressing situations," said Paclík, who does not make a heal from his antipathy, for example, against the Sparta CEO Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with which he would lobby with the political leaders that more money flows from the lottery tax into sports.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote to."
"If it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to say stonep and clear where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not look at Paclík as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the president of the FAČR must be "overparty".
In turn, Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"This is not ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person to return after another half years," Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will end up a Patt-Situation in the future.
Two days before the main meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chairman, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that he would strongly make himself strong in the event of his choice for the FAČR to obtain a new statute, which in the future excludes disputes about the election order.
The functionalist from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election struggle will be safely decisive in the event of a potential success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the unsuccessful election in September, in the event of his election, he wanted to focus on the national team and the profitation of financial resources.
He only decided at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting, so the two-month break could help him to defend his ideas about the direction of football and present it in a wider context.
"On all levels they devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it's time for the association to be guided by someone, the man who is primarily connected to the Jablonecer Club, who also worked for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also thinks that he has sufficient experiences to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the choice are responsible for the Euphorie, which has ruled at times of Ivan Hašek.
"In June, the General Assembly approved statutes which were not as perfect as they all had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we had already had a chairman since September," said Pelta.
He used precisely the revision of the main document of the Civil Association as a locker for the delegates.
"If I am president, then I personally accept it and am willing to bear personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a fundamental thing without which he can't be," Pelta claims.
In addition, he does not try to limit himself to his counterparts.
He had already announced that he could introduce a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he acknowledged because of his legal education and knows well that his counter-kandidat would be his first alternate.
Tomáš Paclík also hasn't attacked for a long time, which left no dry threads on Pelta.
In soccer he has been moving over a year and can already point to some successes."
"But his attacks were decreasing, and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Therefore, many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his counterpart, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes, to the national team.
And this should be the hanging plate of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all the affairs - from the Cusa Bohemians, to the descendants of the corruption scandal last year."
"Everything after that, I would fall to negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure adequate financial resources for the whole football," said the six and fifty-year candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football would not mean any personal cleanings.
"I would have to get acquainted with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, there is understandably nervousity.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates do not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If you really should be the only controversy point as you choose in the third round, then we will get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins back if it finally has a new Leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly crucial day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR starts working hard under him
If the former Deputy Chairman Jindřich Rajchl should be elected at the main meeting on Thursday as the new Chairman of the Czech Republic football association, this would supposedly miss many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice you start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the soccer, and otherwise to continue the work that Ivan Hašek, former chairman, began.
"As chairman, I want to devote myself to the football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts with the UEFA and FIFA, through the national selection, professional football, to the performance football for the youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore wish to distribute the competences of the Executive Committee so that each member devotes itself to a certain area."
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks so that the soccer gets forward in each segment with milestracks."
Many would not be disappointed about this because, instead of criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard now," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it has considered no longer candidates at all.
"I know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don't unequivocally throw me knupples between the legs and question every step I'm doing," he said as an explanation why he has delayed.
"But many people told me that I shouldn't give up because otherwise others would do it."
"That's trust you can't miss," he said.
In fact, he also motivates him to continue the work he has started under Hašek.
"In two years we have done a great piece of work, and I don't want to just throw it away."
"There have been started processes that probably only come into force in a few years and I would only not see that they stop someone," he said, expressing his concerns that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta was chosen, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that is something that Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"He stands in front of all people who would make the football so that he would only be there for chosen ones."
I think you can suggest some things, but not that I am partyable."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because it's all good and not just the chosen one," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a Chairman of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really want to do the best possible for girls."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be subdivided into a Czech and a ähric part, whose winner then rose to the first league."
"Then it couldn't happen that today only three maize clubs play in the league, which is especially a problem for young players in mice," says Rajchl.
Because the Chief of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has joined the Chairman's fight for the function, Rajchl is not confident of assessing his chances that he is chosen.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to their vice-president and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl, who also views the saving of thirty million crowns for unprofitable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he partially blames himself that the association does not draw on a single strain.
While he says of Pelta, "he was disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football to reconfirm," he thinks the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football.
"Nobody can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he was chosen, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek initiated and also the personal occupation in the Commissions would obviously not change in principle."
He would certainly not want to turn things to his favor," judges Rajchl about his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Planning pools in Ufo-Optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience its blue miracle - and rest the tired legs in spray baths after a city tour or a hike.
A book shows where wellness is the most beautiful in the water.
If Iris Meder went on search during the past one and a half years, one in her baggage was not allowed to be missing: her bathing suit.
Backlings lying on the water, she looked high in artfully designed dolls, she swammed marble puts waiting for them at the basin edge, and amazed over acrybically restored youth style swimming halls.
She liked a bathroom, she took it quickly into her notebook - and knowing details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now present them in her recently published book "Badefruden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her "Traise to the most exceptional bathrooms in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and each one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to hate with sports, says Meder - it's just in the water that's different.
Anxiously only that swimming fans have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine steak, while Jogger can breathe the devastating fragrance of fig forests or listen to a cheerful bird whisper in the park.
"I asked myself one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the medal living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubles architecture
Plates in the jumping basin and etheric sauna oil - the wellness factor in baths is so large because all senses are used, says Meder.
And if the builders have made their effort, swimming halls can be a true eye wall: "The place of a floor is a water surface in bathrooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-formated band "Badefruden" conveys on 190 pages knowledgeable about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness oasis - but above all makes it easy to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool collector Meder at their research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent sanctuary baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an original carshave (cave pool in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a flat-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, spectacular views offer many heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in the sight of the Zurich roof pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bathroom in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the floating on the ski slope.
The most exceptional swimming pool design is expected in length field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo landed just in the Alps.
From three open shells open up it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal sky rising in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder rose the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell for sulphur, in Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba, it stinks so strongly for heat oil that one hardly believes to be landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate healing water, which is almost black and its sleeve sticks to the skin as soon as you can slid into the basin - a wellness experience of the special kind.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place looking for beautiful baths: when she wanted to visit the free and sunbad in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom was now closed in 1902 by the architect Dušan Jurkovic.
When Meder threw a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow youth style buildings, she saw uncrowded between the tiles.
On the other hand, in a magnificent swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction are already behind this bathroom; you can discover not only neoromanic elements that come from times of its construction in 1844 but also a maurian hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of the Iris Meder pool - not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to merge different styles of construction into such a great unit," says Meder.
At such a palace, the diving course in the thermal pool is apparently only by-suite.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business shine through
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January the head of the company then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the Germans, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans, according to a study, it is not acceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions expire from this business because it strengthens the problems of the worst in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, author Harald Schumann shows that the competitions on global raw material stock exchanges are making prices high - and banks are therefore engaged in the global hunger problem.
The consumer protector's campaign is directed specifically against German bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are similar.
Originally, raw materials bets were intended to secure traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the zockers have disconnected from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the accusations and said that no business was "value to play the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is currently examining the accusations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the examination should be completed, then the results will be presented to the Executive Board of the German Bank - as well as recommendations on how to deal with this.
At the end of January, the top of the bank will then inform the consequences it draws.
At the end, a reduction in the raw material business could be, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann buckles on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The bet on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatically how reluctant banks today harm the general well."
Ackermann now stands as the top bank lobbyist particularly in duty.
"The Deutsche Bank must delete all the plants from its portfolio, where money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether it is Mr. Ackermann about hungry people or about the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes surprisingly at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the company wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief of Management will not change to the Supervisory Board in a different way than planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order for possible fines, he hardly needs to shave - that would have been his successor to do.
Every second would cancel raw materials plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute of Forsa interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Especially eleven percent, therefore, believe it legitimately that Deutsche Bank offers plants that are betrayed at prices for food.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: each second, according to the survey, would terminate all the investments in which money flows into raw materials speculation.
43 percent would deprive acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent claimed to think about terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Palace of Brussels in 1958 awarded prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and came away.
Now he is reopened as an exhibition house.
When heated by modern post-war architecture, clear forms, glasses of halls, courageous muds and new buildings, typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussler World Exhibition 1958 is a good and famous example.
At that time, Schwanzer Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel glass construction.
The construction is considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made known to the architects so that he built the Pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus junction-like sidebuilding in Munich, he was finally famous internationally in 1973.
His temporarily planned exhibition building was built, rebuilt, and opened in 1962 a 20th-century museum – the "20th House" was called.
However, the building was not suitable for space and technical as a museum - no walls for the hanging of art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the pavilion, now called "21 house" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening the Museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a lucky case in every respect.
The new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which was new director of the Austrian Gallery of Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, professor of art historian with considerable career, among other things in youth as an ice creator, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the Museum of Moderne Salzburg, made the reconstruction strongly with politicians and monument guardians, she acquired public funds and private sponsor funds and established the use.
Apart from present art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a cafe and a book store should exist, and a office house had to be built.
Strengthened oversight, small food
Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation for the execution.
Not only because he rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna sensiblely and won competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was an "unmountainly important place" for him, where he looked at the exhibitions almost every weekend.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already lost generous and lightweight during his relocation to Vienna.
There were far greater problems in the current reconstruction: the building was "a energy sleeve," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade have been exchanged, glass fibre-enhanced insulation glass and replaced the glass roof with a special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two lower floors brought space for the new use, a lowered light burial between house and road ensures the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still the light tail-pavilion.
The original outdoor doors have remained, the house is cleared in the old red-brown stainless steel colour.
And the cinema is just as it was before.
And all of this under strict supervision of the Memorial Authority and with small ethnicity.
"A material that is good and cheap and also liked the Memorial Protection Office often had to be found," says Krischanitz and pointed to a twisted ground in the underground.
Despite all constraints, problems and transformations, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult to have been with the pavilion, "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-City-history".
Such an architecture always stands "in the wrong place" and still wants to "reason a proper consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, for it has occurred a city-building lucky case: The completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier" with offices and housing houses is created around the Swiss garden.
And another lucky case may occur: The 21st house could get strengthening from another cryschanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporary Kunsthalle, and as one hears, it already negotiates with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plants winter crisis package in millions
The railway has a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train losses and delays, Deutsche Bahn claims that a newspaper report will spend more than 70 million euros this year.
The "Image" period reported early under the call for a group-internal crisis plan that by 2015, investments of around 300 million euros were planned.
This aims to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather.
Among other things, a doubling of internal and external employees for snow removal on railways and railways to 16.000 persons is planned.
The aim is to release rail strains up to the start of operation and 90 percent of the needs of operation within four to five hours from snow and ice.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, railway chef Rüdiger Grube had warned against train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, the train in passenger transport had considerable problems, as it was lacking, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Railway Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in delivering ICE trains.
The railway also has been creating for years that it has to make axles of ICE trains more frequently in the workshop after a ICE in the Cologne main station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the USA
After the tumult of Chief Josef Ackermann, new discomfort comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fines there.
As if the problems at home weren't enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry's races are still bringing up its past in the United States: The Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million in a comparison (106 million euros) to settle disputes because of five major co-operative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA suggests a number of large banks that cooperative banks have led to the purchase of financial products with false promises; they would have reduced the risks.
Such papers have been lost strongly during the financial crisis and banks are rising into the depth.
"We are pleased that we could solve the subject without the parties to be courted," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not grant any debt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying $20,5 million.
The NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the arrival of the two currencies.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US Governing Banks and jumps on pledge to protect the customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to replace the damage caused by billions.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also fought other large banks, and in summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs accused.
The mortgage-backed securities in question are the mortgage-backed securities.
These are home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble was placed in 2007, this became a wide range of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the climax of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers shook.
Even though the events have been down for a few years, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the USA.
Investors and supervisory authorities have endeavored countless complaints in order to obtain re-establishment or to avoid wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest claim wave.
It proposes 18 international large banks to have over-profited two US real estate financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage shops in volume of around 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank also has to make a complaint from the FHFA, which concerns several transactions in total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority demands that the Frankfurter stand right for "substantial losses", but not specifying a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as endless and explained that they wanted to refuse.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion at IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests strongly in the IT company IBM.
Since March he has bought shares in the value of more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the major American investor Warren Buffett had always explained that it was not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of companies is only poorly predicting.
But now he has read the business reports of IBM and has changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He has already had to understand much earlier that IBM offers services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment of Warren Buffett is considered to be a ridder in the financial world.
As a result, the IT-Urgestein IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now revealed in the US economy station CNBC that since March he bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway is thus one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM hadn't even known anything about the commitment until now.
He commended the management, which even in the economic crisis had provided ordinary profits.
"You've done a great job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM has been setting up the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centres for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company calculator.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until that time.
He says he invests only in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett, for example, joined a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and developed it with intelligent investment to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Still, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost deceitful sense of deserving money has brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
According to the Buffett investment, the IBM share rose pre-country by a percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion at the stock exchange and thus counts together with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he didn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tackling
After the discovery of the Zwickau Cell, Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which is now reliving.
The murders of eight Turkish people and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a legal extremist background.
This message is responded with anxiety and anxiety in Turkey and within the German population in Germany.
For for many German Turks, this is a long - deadly spouse: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more similar violence with legal extremist background against Turkishs.
Nevertheless, the fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany was never in question.
However, the uncovered legal extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet predictable.
"Does bloody ideology resume?" titled the Internet issue of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasizes that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the legal radical swamp.
Besonnen responded to the Turkish municipality of Germany: she remembered the weekend with a memorial watch before the Brandenburg gate to the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a festival act of the fifty anniversary of the German-Turkish advocacy agreement.
In cheerful colors, fellowship was emphasized - as a story of success.
The reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany gift to the fifty" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this thoughtful connection.
"It starts stinking," says the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and had contributed to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German Turkish Internet forums, extremely critical is discussed by the police's actions and their success of exploration.
Why the German authorities weren't much more likely to search for suspects in legal extremist circles, the authors are surprised.
Some of them are at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: "When there continues to be slipped, the migrants remain nothing but self-defense and armed."
"This is probably the best self-protection."
"From the goodness of the clarification and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network, inner peace in Germany is very strongly dependent," writes "Selen".
What it means when the inner peace is in danger in Germany, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s clarified.
The photo of Solingen's fire ruins is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turkish living here that there is a tackling threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can mood in right violence.
However, the attacks sharpened the we-feeling on Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of Germany's policy was invoked after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a condolence to the Turkish presidents, but at the funeral celebration in Cologne, he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - cinema then counted in his speech how many charges the Turkishs made.
As if the value of a person is calculated according to the height of his tax duties.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks has since been in the local rule of law.
In addition to the efforts of extensive information and re-evaluation of excess terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The Scandal Bank of Zurisee
The most adventurous bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from a crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
That's why Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular decline from the top of the Bundesbank, he was announced in July that he would join a almost as spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, praised Switzerland for their beauty and UBS whether their newly gained solidarity and made friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has achieved the Turnaround."
"I look forward to cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would be different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had transformed all the bank's security systems and had shocked around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Officer Oswald Grübel, a not only famous banker in Switzerland, had to go.
The President of the Administrative Council of the UBS has also been regarded as being attacked since then - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been known that Weber is allowed to consult the Bank in February 2012.
And he takes over the Board of Directors in May - not until 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this gets hard.
He is not a banker, but an economic professor and note banker, and he certainly needed a working time.
He then takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has proved once again that it has long deserved the title "greatest Scandalbank of Europe".
For the UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and has been slandering from a scandal in the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, the once proud Swiss bank will be spared.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid, but also excavated Swiss assets manager combined it with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a very large number in the investment banking.
In 2007, the UBS managed more money of wealthy customers than any other bank in the world, on the one hand.
On the other hand, she was a investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
That was impression.
The one-time banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger said: "I always put the UBS as a pattern of a good bank at that time."
"Today, you wonder, "How could I just be so wrong?"
He was seriously wrong.
In 2007, it was first apparent that something related was in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Officer Peter Wuffli was surprisingly resigned, who was previously considered a highly intellectual and also genial banker.
A few months later, one knew why he had gone.
The bank's investment spare had shocked with subprime papers and had to depreciate billions.
To school this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but those who had been struggling about the nose until recently: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which had been so silent that one did not even know his name.
But that was only the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, President-in-Office of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, still the second-sided board of Switzerland.
In October 2008 the catastrophe followed: the UBS stood in the financial crisis in view of its misinvestments and had to be saved by the State.
The National Bank bought the UBS for thirty billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced change bond that she could become a co-owner of the Bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses so large banks.
Finally, the 2007 UBS balance sheet was more than five times the size of Switzerland's economic performance (see graphics).
"We couldn't save the UBS once," says bank researchers Geiger.
The first catastrophe joined the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of capable customers who might have left taxes using the Bank.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions and penalties.
The UBS thus known more or less open to have helped to withdraw tax.
At the same time, she lost something that has ever been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the withdrawal of Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the Exodus of Customer Moneys.
Thus, within a few months, the Bank lost its credibility in both central business sectors: in investment banking due to defective speculations and in assets management through the aid to tax retardation.
And just when it got a little calm again, just as one thought, the UBS will already get it back, then this unsolicit dealer story follows: A single dealer is shocking EUR 1.7 billion before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it is evident that risk management in investment banking does not seem to work.
"With the case Adoboli, you have to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Bank Institute of Zurich University.
The financial board of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not control the risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had taken a long time ago to become guardians of the great assets of the world: no too big risks, security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic could break the world.
The Tresores of the Swiss banks became a symbol of incomprehensible reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The central of the UBS in Zurich is still fitting the cliff of the shared Swiss private bank - it is just a bit larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters on the Zurich Railwayway, which leads from the main train station directly to the Zurich Sea, which is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are splendid, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditions such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks have been living here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elitary private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall can be entered by a heavy rotary door.
Inside the walls are marble clothed, there are thick leather chairs, beside the bank logo a large sign of the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point expelled - or betrayed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not like to read his name in the newspaper, and finally he, like all Swiss bankers, also does business with the two large banks.
The UBS has become much too big, he finds, especially in the investment banking, where the fishing axis have also spread.
The Swiss don't have anything to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the angel axis."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking that changed the UBS, gave its only high profits and then the debakel: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hesitant in his book "The UBS Crash".
The politicians approved up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the large bank standing before the bankruptcy.
How could it be?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three Swiss large banks joined a huge group.
It was created by a bank, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and grew ever further.
This helped the two different predecessor banks of the UBS complement: a rich, but sleepy bank with the focus of assets management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came favorably to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are connected to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the Group of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the Bauchmensch, who worked up from the banking teaching to the top."
But Ospel relyed on Wuffli at the end.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Surely, exaggeration came before the case.
The UBS staff are clearly reminded of the leadership meetings on which Group Chief Wuffli repeatedly issued the same parole: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the earth.
She quoted the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go to the top.
Some steps had been lucky for her.
In the exchange business and in the share trading she played all over the top.
However, business consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in the international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS entered an adventure that she almost cost the existence.
Hungrig after growth, both the Bank itself and a Hedge Fund founded in American subprime plants.
It developed into a huge machine which packed and extended securities on American mortgage credits, but also had risks.
Even when other banks long sought the exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS has bought there," says Bankenexperte Geiger.
So big the euphory, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go than the attempts to clean up were more difficult than they thought.
Posts at the UBS became a slumber seat and are up to date fuzzy.
Whoever leads the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
It must find a strategy for a bank that has eradicated all nearby business models.
Bank researchers Geiger already has an idea: end with investment banking, focus on assets management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go (now).
But investment banking is supposed to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
The next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to present its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was only thought to be a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has persisted: he is to keep conducting the businesses of the UBS, the Zurich Bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to retreat the investment bank to the middle of the nineties.
He's reaching 3500 places.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask.
Publicly, he only says that he will first look for a apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Anxiety of recession in Europe burdens US stock exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has encouraged US investors to wake up weekly.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without collapse.
The drowned industrial production on the continent embroidered the hopes of stabilising the school monument crisis in the germ.

The US investors were skeptically voting: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to escape from a recession as soon as possible, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
Therefore, it is in his view too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades of old principle about the breaks and rose into the US technology industry.
His investment over more than ten billion dollars in IBM was based on the share rate of the traditional group and, against the trend in the trade history, it was initially noted by just a percent higher.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.

Intelligent crowns spread out in cities
In many places, seed grains are considered to be "problem birds": But the cities have long been displaced, experts claim.
The one likes them, the others want to get rid of them very quickly: crowns have been part of the city image for centuries, but in many municipalities, residents have been complaining about the dirt and noise of the animals.
A means against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows were no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crown symposium in the East Frisian empty.
There, experts from the entire federal region advised about possible pathways.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature protectors also led the problems in cities to the fleeing of the specially protected seed crews: the use of chemicals in agriculture has increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical brown trees made the birds hard to live.
Crowns are under nature protection.
Large colonies with more than 600 brown couples are available in the Westfälische Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen and in empty.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the massive killing of crowns in the district provided negative strikes.
Criticians had described the catching of the animals in bird traps and the striking of knuppels as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the amazement, brings nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver found out of empty.
Nesters spray away with water or drop trees, often have undesirable consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals vary, large colonies divide and distribute themselves in other places."
Greeting is only possible as an exception to hospitals, old-age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them away."
Without the countryside, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, mayor Wolfgang Kellner said empty.
It is thought that a combination of the animals from sensitive housing areas and locking offers is a combination to relocate them in other places.
"Infotables instead of chain sawing," however, psychologist and ethnologian Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different relationship with the animals: "We can finally end up with a peek in the face with the best self-consciousness."
Jürgens had founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Aseberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, on the signs of the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise of the birds, Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication that has a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crowns not only use tools to get to a delicate bite but even produce their tool itself as a tool.
Conduct researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested on four seed crows as far as the intelligence of birds is sufficient.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they had to bring a gear to the collapse in order to reach a motten larve.
Without a lot of training, they recognized deliberately what size and shape a stone must have to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the prudent crowns had to solve a more fragile problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small ice cream with a motten larve.
The birds could not reach their probe with the snail.
However, the researchers had laid wire pieces on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with which they then blew the oak on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks on a coup remained out.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland are present at EM 2012.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Following the double successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal hit Bosnia-Hercegowina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM partition in a row perfect after 0:0.
There was a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off play at the outer side of Montenegro, after the replay (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
There was nothing more to burn Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland took a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) achieved the further results for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade femeter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened for Bosnia twice.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow red map (54.).
Bosnia had already failed to Portugal in the Play-offs for the World Cup 2010 in South Africa.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon Portugal caught a start by measure.
Ronaldo hunted a 30-metre free drive to the early tour of the masquettes.
A good quarter hour later Nani showed his wide-shot quality and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance by Torjager Edin Dzeko.
The Ex-Wolfsburger from the English table guide Manchester City put a headball on the bottom of the Latte, but the ball did not exceed the Torline (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, arbitrary judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergoldding was at the heart of arbitrary.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Criminal Area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after Fabio Coentrao's action, which Misimovic safely transformed.
After the break, however, the Vice-Europe champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81th minute.
In 1976, the European champion will go to EM for the fifth time in succession.
However, the team of trainers Michal Bilek with the Federalliga-Legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1 FC Nuremberg) had also been lucky and had to survive a horror in the initial phase.
Endman Petr Cech, with a reflex at the last moment, prevented a possible ownership by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the criminal area border just close to the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crossing had to save for the already beaten World Class Tower of the Czechs, again the storm of the FC Seoul had deducted (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey missed the soccer wonder of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0:0.
While national trainer Guus Hiddink has to clear its place as safely as well as safely on the 2002 World Cup Third Bank, the Croatians are allowed to enjoy their fourth participation in an EM end round.
Before 3000 spectators in the Maksimir town, the Turks almost had caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance shot only the phost, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the abrupt in the gate.
However, after the horror, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians didn't burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which took place for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Federal League-Legionary Danijel Pranjic (Bayern München) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni is driving to EM
In Dublin, the Irish have celebrated the first EM participant in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of trainers Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a predecision with the 4:0 success in the replay, in the 32th minute.
Constantin Vassiljev (57.) was similar to the guests.
Ireland had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last moment, the Estonian rear team prevented the possible leadership.
But in the 32nd minute it was ready.
After a defenseless defense by final Pavel Londak, Ward was the place and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

Mass slaughter at a personal level
Simply and generously, Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Fear. A story of the First World War, tells you in nineteen destinies" with a long list of major people who are at heart.
Here's a tip on how to handle: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in Englund's romantic story very well. And these main people will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you lost like Englund's men and women in the fog of war and rob your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he does not describe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are little ambassadors, rash reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is "feels, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unintentional men and women together on both sides of the war, from school girls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, healthcare drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become war prisoners, lose limbs, become mad or die.
Every one of these lives flicks up like the Votiv churches in one church, some are added while others disappear.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war on the Westfront.
"Beauty and horror" walks with experts over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall bees baskets, a celebrated Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsetsflies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina who shouts for Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or take the escape?
Who's coming at all?
Nobody understands what's happening or why this war is being run at all.
"Freunding facts," Englund notes, "were excited with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Schönheit und Schrecken" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship matross.
Their stories were mainly extracted from memories, letters and other materials already published.
Their life reports can be shocking or thrilling, but they are very alive in Englunds of the collection of small moments that lose details.
Many of them act of lack and help.
In the history of a German school girl, he says, "Replace, everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, wrong cycling gum, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement meal in Germany.
He describes "Fleish made of pressed rice and baked in hammer fat (and was last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes filled with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of worsts, 511 registered coffee replacements."
Some stories are of honor and braveness.
A American recognizes his own urge to wildness and says about the war: "You feel that despite all that was intended for men rather than to sit in the lean chair, with the dining leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and to do so than mean such a facade civilization and as if there were no barbari behind their own strengthened and slain shirt breast."
In turn, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and that nobody will notice or take care of it.
"If you take distance from the idea of offering yourself, you want to think this happens before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a sentenced man who was imprisoned in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart and about new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic contest," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestial of the young century," "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in measure, who slept while sitting behind a desk."
People are acting in unforeseen manner and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a sex disease to escape the front service.
"The great expression of it can be discovered in the trade with gonococock eggs, because soldiers bought and smashed themselves on their Genitalia, in the hope of going to the hospital," he writes.
"Jene who were really desperate struck in his eyes, which led them to be blind to the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes smooth, yet inconsistent and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he begins the way the war "in a unique way uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to wonder why their leaders bring them to battle.
The best books about the First World War were usually more falsified as Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional fame hall.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book.
I don't give it here anymore.
But it is as if he had taken us away with his book this side with the main people in front of the nose and burned us with a string wood.
After an early failure, a minutely planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved in carrying some of them arms of action.
They had decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at this time there are few people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. All others at first believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of thisrnate, and the household occupied a huge increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by watching occupations in other cities.
A disaster exercise took place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called chaos education - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid shifting of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to enter the park came "in the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the commands, which spoke for a declaration as "exercising".
"The few policemen who were involved in my knowledge did not know that it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the Resort."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then turned back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned from these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including commissions from all over the city - dogships of mobile officials who are normally used in high-criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people go in and out in the park, almost like pendler, so 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people stayed in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded news that drowned from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their bright blue windjackets, many protesters simply reaped their things together and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 a.m., no tents would be attacked to give the protesters time to pack their possessions together.
Other teams of officials were seen how they gathered in the area to intervene, arrests should be needed in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman of the police president, said that this had been done for their own security.
But many journalists claim that they were to stop watching the police operations in the park, and they said that the handling of the officials was very rude.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars in Church Street could have taken pictures on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the great confusion of personal matters of the protesters, including suitcases, art grass and bags with clothing, their employees followed the city cleaning, which had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged out. Pictures of this appeared sooner on the Internet.
A main core of protesters called position near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp joined their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Officials of disaster protection were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until 3:30 a.m.
The premises were completed after 75 minutes, according to the police's statements.
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests came, as he said, because of "inappropriate conduct and opposition to a arrest".
The most prominent official on site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Criminal Officers, was also there.
In spite of his presence, Mr. Kelly "not the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In the case of access, a second group of officials on the eastern side of the Broadway waited between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, Barrikades were built.
It could be observed how these locations from the police continued to expand the circle around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with signs of protection, were observed to drive people out.
There were about 28 people in the north.
Some of the most violent activities of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5:00 a.m., a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tyre of a police bus.
In one place, the quantity threw a piece of lockwood.
At the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of the maintainer will lodge action against the city for discharges
The union, which represents hundreds of school attendants who have lost their work last month, intends to complain the city on Wednesday, as the releases are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on schools that teach poor students.
The action is probably the last possibility that the union, the District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred seventy school workers, care coordinators and other employees who belonged to the city's most poorly paid staff and had lost their work in a chess train on 7 October, described the trade union leader as a political revenge for refusing the city's access to a health found that the working groups had been able to join the budgetary gaps last year.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the discharges were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that the budget did not specify anything that employees would be released from school aid.
Officials of the City Council 37 said that they had and warned the Ministry of Education for a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the appeal will be formally announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will lead Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as an accused and count eight dismissed workers as applicants who are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman of the city’s Ministry of Justice, said that the city does not prejudge the action and therefore could not be commented on their individual claims.
According to a draft action, which the New York Times is present, the union has concentrated on the number of dismissals in the schools in the poor districts of the city to support a complaint for inequal treatment. She claims that poor schools have lost more helpers because they have been chronic underfinanced.
It states that while there were no releases on Staten Island and only few releases in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers in the district of 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school workers who were employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of foolish parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra financing for each poor school registration.
The trade union also complains that the heads of the high schools were led by the language in a memo, which approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: transpose) in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central station.
"Sixty-six coordinators have been released, not transposed," the draft action states.
Mission finished, Congress ready to communicate with Libya
Finally, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already talking about the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations of the Senate concludes a resolution under the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and American troops for their "mood".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was simply in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House argued on the choice of a number of resolutions to approve or approve the role of the US military in the Libya mission of NATO.
In June Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the restricted use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad border group of both parties and there was no vote.
The same day, however, this law passed through in the Senate. In addition, the Chamber agreed to a decision to reduce the funds for American operations in Libya.
This led the U.S. mission into a kind of legislative vague fire - with a convention that was raised enough to criticize Obama's approach within the mission, but not angry enough to finally remove the ground under its feet.
Then the unresolvedness of the Congress was overwhelmed by the events.
Tripolis fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "prays the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partner, who support military operations to protect people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States on a successful and irreversible transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Relations Board or will they divide the legislators as the law of June did?
The final version is based on the resistance of the Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top-republician of the Committee.
Lugar's speaker said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is on the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every conference legislature period of the Republicans and some democratics.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or of another area that comes at the time of voting in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlated change is only one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress, including a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to the Congress as well as to the Senate - others are only slightly different.
In the Senate alone there are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change and another dozens that would control "bound expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - especially beginners with the Republicans who want to polish their courses - the possibility of praising that they have "authorised" such a measure.
The budgetary control law, adopted in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budgetary balance.
In March 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution which supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some Members wish to limit the number of provisions which members of the Congress may submit, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) intends to limit the limitation to two presidential times.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage under gender equality is just as a change that prohibits burning flags is a repeating presentation.
Some legislatures also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of the States reject them.
As diligent as Members propose amendments, they move as quickly as they have been in recent years.
At the 111th Congress, legislatures presented 77 such changes. at the 110th Congress 66.
The pace is blurred compared to that of the early 1990s, where members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures available by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment, which is added - the 27. - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Frequently, but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after a armed man shot on her during a election in Tucson, the Republicanian Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on Monday evening in the national television. She singed alone to the Broadway track "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than that of returning to the convention.
When she and Diane Sawyer appeared in the ABC news "20/20", she ran by words and needed help in walking.
The mission showed the heavy slow recovery of the damage that the ball, dividing its skulls, drilled the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago she returned to the convention astonishingly to give her voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "heavy".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41): "Good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly "20/20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The special pursues Gifford's recovery since the attack on 8 January.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first weeks, you can see her in the hospital bed, with barely shaved head and a long scarf over the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nick with his head.
A tick with the lip.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords flips another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you can see how the Congress Member sings together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours each day with therapy, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12 he had read an article of a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time after the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The suspicious protector Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forced to be treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hart, heart, heart."
During the restoration of his wife, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?" said Kelly.
You've just been hit.
And you will stand through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Trups feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street-Gala, who gathered millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a tag, hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The amount of black smokes stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation action in spring.
A ranked military officer on the Gala, who was observed, among other things, by the chief and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphanage children," wrote the officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organisers meant it well.
I know.
But it wasn't a respect, really not.
The contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are summoned with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its prize, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if you do people in Uniform Suffering.
"We were not victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded forces in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear unthankful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They have also realized that the anger, the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War, was far worse.
As a result, talks about compassion in the breast-feeding and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from battles with the marines, the Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a feeling of reverence, as they conquered rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "great, violent veteran is hidden under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had taken over an elevated state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtlely asked whether he was able to stand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the battle.
"If you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," said Cancian to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield are rarely considered to be praised by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroence as it was absolutely usual in the Second World War," said Leutnant General David Barno a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praises of politicians and the public are largely concentrated on the suffering of an employee.
Trups find recognition for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces the growing pressure to tough interference in rape
This week an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of non-intervening in a rape before the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier in the night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who had a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if he could accompany her on a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texanerin cursed her concerns.
I thought, "What, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard of my abdomen feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man came behind her, pushed her down and raped her, claimed her.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officers are afraid of a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which decides whether a complaint which they have filed against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed to court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not taken action against the widespread rape within the military and under violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the complaint included 17 applicants at the beginning, but in the following months it rose to 28: 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to determine, condemn or provide adequate justice according to the supposed attacks.
Burke says she's pursuing the top military leadership, as the problem started there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of the torment? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted almost 400 survivors since February, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of putting all applicants their eggs into a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The team of defense for the Ministry of Defense, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to reject a complaint.
The acts of the Court of First Instance, Newsweek, provide a detailed defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or earlier soldiers for injuries to which the armed forces have come.
Due to a Law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries that are added to soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage caused during the military service of the applicants," the document states.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in battle.
It's time the military is being modernised, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her battle: three more complaints besides them are hanging.
At the Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four main military academies for suspicious promotion of a woman-fighting atmosphere.
Of this, the non-profitful Vietnam Veteran of America gathers a complaint against the military in which the diagnosis "personal disturbance" was concentrated on the victims of rape in order to release them from the service - a usual practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veteran Administration (d.h. the administration of the war veterans) in which they prescribed their discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who indicated that they were sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which provides a number of points of reference.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (dt.: Office for Prevention and Reporting Sexual Missbrauch) of the Ministry of Defense 3.158 sexual abuses were displayed.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes account of about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases in which it comes a year.
The report, published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: in 2010 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military were in court, only half as many as civil law.
The applicants in Burkes case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the suspicious rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she said, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a number of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing she was asked for the sex she had before the attack with her friend.
Six people said to be characteristic in the name of the suspicious perpetrator, who was finally freely pronounced.
"I remember the day when the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the woes would put on. I ran out of the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personal disturbance and declared it incapable for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed unrespectfully, so that she would not receive any support.
Whether the action that Lyman and the other applicants have filed is going forward is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "I believe they should go ahead."
What is between them and a judgment is this doctor who has been criticized since it has been questioned for the first time.
I'm a critic of the Feres Doctor in the past.
The military decades afterwards, because they do not have the same incentive and the same arrogance that brings liability.
He adds: "The chances stand against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will start with its hundreds of other claims for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until it comes to reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became a new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who stood up to have committed his first public hearing in the court at an amocratic race in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time to his attack in front of his computer and treasured with some of the millions of nationalists who support legal extreme groups on pages of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how to find her?
This is easy - you just need to log in to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the principal author of a recently published report by the UK idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding of personal data is so encyclopaedic, says Bartlett, that the researchers simply need to use the advertisement tool on the site to define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as it has been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-hand extreme groups throughout Europe and then saw them with adds, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, the adds users invited to a survey in which they were asked for their education, their attitude towards violence and their own future assessment.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 members of 14 very right parties in 11 European countries, without having to leave their office once.
"It's a pretty new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprising. Online leaders of legal extreem groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and politicians use the page to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, which averagely add three content per day, Facebook's "Datasupernova" generates a research tree that has made the number of scientific work with the name of this page increase by almost 800% in the title over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this site people who are usually not reaching with your Clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first, and they would never have given them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook all of this falls away - you're going directly to them."
Others say that the page offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues, found that students who discussed their full rage on Facebook tend to drink problems significantly more than students who were insisting on this subject.
Moreno suggests that equal numbers of students, for example residents, monitor the page and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you didn't recognize it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and Head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children that wouldn't have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly collects the data of its own population.
The data team of the site has created statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the 2010 intermediate elections and a National Gambling Index (which was primarily used to include information on which only Facebook has access - Masters of digital freedom have long been aware that the page should make its large data foundation available for others for research purposes.)
However, Facebook users know that the page observes them whether they want it or not. To play Scrabble with a friend that is thousands of miles away, you can get your personal data to the site.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey that they do not even know anything?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines as they collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users at all have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, to a study from 2006 in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a Clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to take care of the social sector - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Call and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who had been two amok runs in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance in front of a public court in Oslo as a "resistant" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple ride in Norway," he said in front of a court hall with more than 500 people.
"I raise opposition to the court, as you have received your mandate from organizations, supporting hatsidologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I am not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monopoly, since he "didn't give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who presented a predescribed speech, the permission to contact his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik investigating for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will check all the visits and all the correspondence for eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted the confirmation that he stayed behind castle and biegel.
All took part in the goal that everything was going beyond a way.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it continues a piece after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked quietly and professionally during the whole hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not sick of spirits and said that there was no evidence that he had had been complicit.
Some may find that the attacks of July 22 were apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looks like a monster, but he doesn't do that," said the family of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford and highlighted the technique genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans might find the most indicative in the recently discovered job interview, which this week before special film presentations were released on the important markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and working processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and himself appointed hippie, but he was also an acrubic organizer who was zealously based on diagrams - a man who believed that many leaders suffered from "a disease of thinking", "that is a really great idea of 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringly developed the TV series "Triumph of the specialists" about the breakup of the personal computer. And he sat together more than an hour with jobs in which they had one of the rare, detailed discussions.
At that time, as 10 years had passed since Jobs had been pushed from Apple, and he already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, looking forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in experts, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing in delivery.
Only after Job's death a complete VHS copy was discovered in the garage of the director.
This lightly revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The lost interview" that comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to abhor detailed interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly zealously in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds meditation, in which jobs clearly weigh his thoughts and work for accuracy.
There are also moments in which Jobs' Perfectionism comes to pass when he seems to be unpatient to Cringly's questions and urges him to get faster into topics or side-treatments of greater importance.
Before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview appears somewhat incredibly far-sighted when jobs evaluate what other companies make his opinion right or wrong and represent his own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthume appraisals of the career jobs'. But to see jobs here as the inclined dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after doing all of this here, he left and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to conduct a company:
"Why do you do things?" and the answer you always get is, "Oh, so it's made easy."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing, no one in business really thinks about things.
I found that.
Jobs continues his efforts to rationalise the accounting at Apple.
Amazing how costs were recorded - mostly one started with "standard costs" that were counted on mere suspicion and then adapted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined up to the smallest.
How the Pope was specialized:
Jobs tells about the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could enter the telephone company for nothing.
The device has already been written a lot, but Jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is infectious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable phone, by calling a call and then connecting from an AT&T network to another, while running as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when you grilled into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," says Jobs kicherning.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that can control billions of dollars of infrastructure all over the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without them.
Jobs continue to tell about a glorious string that Wozniak and he almost deducted when they called on through Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were so well able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called to speak to the American diplomats in the middle of the night, they had to ride before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12 when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phoneat, jobs received part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at age and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it dealt with his employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever produced".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher Röhre and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talk about how to find new products spontaneously.
Early in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a customer to build the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about both the construction and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later at Apple he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember pissing arguments... they shouted that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could have built for $15. That was incredibly credible.
Over large companies that drop down:
Long before he had Apple resurrected, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial enthusiasts met their visions into stumbling and lost control of their shares.
"Say we, you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copyer or printer, na and?"
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius, which has led to this monopoly position, is needed by the people who do not have a concept of good products vs. bad products, erased - craft art.
This happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, that Microsoft could have been the 1990s...
They caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"It's a lot of crafts art between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You're learning a lot about his feathers.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it goes on to taste, it goes beyond that one tries to intervene with the best stuff that man has created and then try to bring these things together to what one does.
Picasso said that good artists copy, clue great artists.
We're always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who are randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health laws when court takes case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically shared question whether one will listen to a fight against the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Anton Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the court that the case was represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt was a complaint that had raised 26 states against the far-reaching reform of healthcare, which had been decided last year by the Congress, a law which was a slogan among the conservative activists throughout the US.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, in March, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected, which is probably going to be aggravated by the 2012 presidency campaign, which will be in full progress at the time when the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who stands before court and will claim that the law is to shake will probably be Paul Clement, once General Prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-aged group dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who challenged the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who is enormously involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel for a few hours after the court had consulted the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Head of the Republican Group in the Senate and an clarified opponent of the health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been visiting events of the Federalist society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempted from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the Lower Federal Judges.
If they were, they would be covered by principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge can participate in beneficiary events in law nearer and other organizations, where the judge may not be a spokesman, a guest of honor or a program of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas reached two of the firms related to the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this to alarm moral and government activists.
"This astonishing break with morality and the contrast to the code punishes the complaints of some judges, the court holds the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the USA.
"The judges won and dinner during a beneficiary event with lawyers with floating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support of a donation action for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would be mixed too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas's wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was prosecutor-general under the Obama government when the first laws were brought to court in first instance.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case for prejudice, since it was too engaged in defense of the law in order to be unprecedented.
Kagan doesn't make any institutions to do this.
Boeing pulls record order of 18 trillion dollars to land
Airline Emirates order 50 two-way planes of type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 more planes.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than 1 billion dollars.
It is really a rare message that a company receives a order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the listing price for these 50 aircraft is at a record of $18 trillion.
The contractor of Boeing is also unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future plane orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East in the next 20 years need 2.520 aircraft worth $450 trillion.
On the weekend, Boeing announced his largest order for commercial aircraft, measured at the value of the order: 50 two-day Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammer contract came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced, Boeing announced in 2011, an option on the purchase of 20 other aircraft that makes the entire list price rise to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8 ordered the so-called Dreamliner, which enormously improves the gas consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these planes is more than 1 billion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's exchange professional.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are owned by the oil-producing countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but rather an increase in oil prices which usually harm the airlines, since this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or move airplane orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural security," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-space aircraft and helps keep the Airbus competitors SAS in chess that attacks the predominance with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that you would move the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was delayed to gain greater confidence after customers demanded a higher load of use and range.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses apparent choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer Fausto Vallejo supported the PRI in the race around the Governor's posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of the Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the provisional results, Fausto Vallejo won the race around the Governor's posts in the Western State by the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire election process and especially on the last day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys ... You have occupied election cabins, building street blocks ... and man has commissioned to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just beat Claderon, who had led to the surveys before the day of election.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the currently appointed Governor, was held at the place Three, a severe defeat for the split and unhappy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan was dominated for a long time by drug cards specializing in marijuana, heroin, and amfetamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence still lasts.
A PAN mayor was killed one week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have gone out of the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disturbing the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is probably represented by the PRI in the race around the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will let us look courageously for the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help the euro area rescue
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe school crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend which will reduce Asia's growth.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations in the world need to do "all in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) who are "successless" to look at the difficulties in Europe and said that the financial support of the European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all sitting in the same boat."
"Everyone who can help Europe from this crisis is also helpful," he said Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asien may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all means."
In recent months, the European Monetary Union has come into a serious school memorial crisis.
In recent days Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers have withdrawn from Italy and Greece.
The emerging serious school monument crisis in Europe is anxious that the global economy could crash into the recession and led to calls that the leading emerging countries would have to do together to support the euro area.
Mr. Nag foretold that any support from Asia is channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements, such as the purchase of EU Legislative Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), offer greater negotiation power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro area, since its own economy is now suffering from the declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the euro area to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face great challenges and we need to have a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a job, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have a cause to help the rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the U.S. Brown University, said that it would be very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million of dollars or less per day live.
"Where they will find out that the Greeks are going to retire with 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Executive Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to maintain the numerous and well-paid public service employees in Greece, with jobs in badly managed, losses such as rail services.
Mr Nag said that the crisiss in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/threates "the risk of degradation" due to the threatening danger from Europe.
He said that vulnerable threshold markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant immigration of their vocabulary.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon for possible defense cuts
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta heated the convention on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would not weaken national security. Thus he triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the wars in Afghanistan and the civil fluid bands.
The Pentagon already thinks of cuts of $450 trillion over the coming decade, but now fears that further reductions will be needed by $600 trillion or more if the convention cannot complete the expenditure.
"The effects of these reductions would be devastating to the Ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the convention in the creation of a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called coverage, would lead to 23% general reductions and a stop of numerous new projects.
"Soll a high reduction, carried out in such an undiscovered way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unperformable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernisation efforts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be forced to unwillingly separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with certain probability of limitation in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who keep our military upright and seriously damage our alert will."
The reductions were finally hit by the fighting forces," said Panetta.
"Whilst the war contingents in the anti-terror warfare are not directly affected by the attack, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect war effort," said Panetta.
"Personal settings have been reduced, which would lead to delays in the settings and attitudes that support war."
"The salaries of staff would be reduced, which leads to late payments to wartime dealers and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential influence of automatic reductions on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of a confiscation of the Ministry of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as a leading military force in the world."
"We are defeated against this draconic act," said the senators in a joint declaration on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we can't live with, and it's certainly nothing to push us up."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United Nations and should not be allowed to enter."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands for a reduction in the pentagon.
Panetta has increasingly expressed the possible reductions, although he has been able to collect many years of experience with the budget at the convention and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing serious decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a dark picture that could be ahead - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air-wave guard without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, a army of the barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," said Panetta in his opening talk in the Pentagon.
"It is an army that lacks moral and alert willingness and which is not able to take it with potential opponents."
"She makes a really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta presented new details of how reductions create "significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our worldwide ability to use and intervention, which leads to an inacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects could be victimized, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.
This list includes F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber plane, the next generation of ballistic submarine, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighter that Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If you stop the further development and tests of the F35, this would save up to 80 billion dollars over the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step towards upgrading, so that possible dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Unlearn a Lüge
A look at the current headlines shows how vulnerable and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The President-in-Office of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is working on becoming a master of the accusations of sexual harassment by several women.
Penn State's management is accused of the myod, as it is said to have kept reports after which a retired football trainer boy has sexually abused.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French president Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to the American President Barack Obama that Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
The New York Congress Deputy and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became annoying when he made disbelievers that were very quickly rejected by impeccable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in the financing of the campaign, which is related to the intuition of an extramarital affair.
And, of course, no one who has experienced it has triggered the media circle, President Bill Clinton, when he lied to Monica Lewinsky during his second term of office at the Oval Office on his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about shoes in school and college tests are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the answers to examining so that they were well in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and shoes are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times each day.
However, many of these lies are considered an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "covering lies" is one that is important to learn for every person, both for personal and for professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Sharaden, in which it is the goal of calling "Hab you!", the decoupling of a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the past six decades at recognized universities that carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
A result of research is that most old myths have been deprived of lying.
lying looks into your eyes.
They don't always stotter, stamp, rest, and shake.
However, it is not possible to conclude that these liars are difficult to uncover and dismiss.
A practiced liar can penetrate to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine face expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years in examining the scientific results of the comprehensive and continuously growing area of detonation, and it is clear that the decoupling of a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us rightly in our complex world, especially if the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belongs to our own occupational responsibilities.
Good liars are very good in esteeming other people, who are awakening their interest and dominating their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more often lying than introverted people that men are more often "self-oriented" lying than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - they usually want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often lying to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been deceived as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying this person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by watching the normal behaviour of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It presents a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, laughter, the voice quality of their experimental person.
They should better know when someone usually triples with the foot, so they do not accuse him too wrong if he triples with the foot during a meeting.
Then take care of accumulations of verbal and non-verbal behavior.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells, not as evidence of a detonation.
People who deceive may disturb when they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet point to the door or they lie towards the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relax after the conversation", this deep, relaxing breath and the change in the attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questionners often falsely signal that an attitude call is over, only to look out after this relaxation after the conversation.
Take care of the language of your experimental person.
Scott Peterson's exiler is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and a national search for her triggered.
Thousands can also use a distant language: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeated a fragile question as a whole.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a fragile question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... for best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than material, which often shrinks the alarm bells.
There is no magic agent to decorate lies, but you can learn skills thanks to which a depreciation is possible.
Thanks to these capabilities, everyone can become more rarely a victim of fraudulents, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after risk by delayed U.S. authorisation
Several days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, with which the trade unions were annoyed and at the same time calm down environmental protectors, the pipeline-building companies are trying to plan the project to return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska parliamentary building.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline is finally approved, even with a different course.
To this end, after an announcement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, a decision on a federal authorisation for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, which avoided the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision by 2013, after the elections in the next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written declaration that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and admitted his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrel oil per day from Alberta Province to the refinery in Texas.
The pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmental protectors hate them, but they love labour markets because they estimate that pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of the sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy states that the main auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review procedure focusing on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist who was abandoned by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was consultant of Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company, which was commissioned to conduct the original study, was an inappropriate choice because it is connected with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused because she supposedly forced a baby out of fear to break
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have received a rage attack that would have scared her little daughter so much that she had given herself fear.
The tyre of the lady Marmalade singer made the 18-month old Genevieve Monk such anxiety that she suffered from "personal change, sleeping disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was last November last year when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, wanted to break up a nurse, and Genevieve for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on the arm into the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"So anyone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle exhorted the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone: "You should not put your daughter off near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to shrink - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to kick water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you have done with my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle crashed on the mother who was still carrying Genevieve on the arm, and had to be stopped by her companion and moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to pass, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an excuse in writing, but no answer was received.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The complaint is based on a non-existent loss, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he would not take into account any Honorary and plan the family, the money they get to donate to child cancer help.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely inacceptable, especially when it is shown to a childgarten who wears a 18 month old baby on the arm."
Climate inevitablenesses burst the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is at the government, in Sinaloa, unemployment and blackwork rose, while foreign investments declined and the economy staggered.
In 2011, Sinaloas will remember the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who himself referred to as the initiator of the change and has given great hopes regarding economic growth, is to the government. However, due to the climatic misfortunes, it cannot be said of growth, but the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions in agriculture, but also narrowed the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year This is mainly due to the historical degradation of agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which affected further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (d. Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582 000 hectares of agriculturally used lands were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity by November continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituteo Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, since from January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53% of the population. In the second quarter, unemployment rates increased to 5.28% and from July to 6.19%, which resulted in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa.
Low liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa is due to several factors in the year. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences at the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment which has to do with several factors. Among other things, liquidity losses on the market as a result of the medium reductions adopted by the legislation to combat money laundering at the convention, because for those who are banned to buy dollars it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest or use it for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined, on the one hand, due to the arrival problems and on the other, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work that makes unemployment rise," he says.
Blackwork
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, taking into account the high proportion of black labour, which includes 60.38 percent of workers in the country working without paying into the social insurance case.
The low wages, the lowest in the whole of Mexico, come to unemployment and blackwork, according to the statistics of the Instituteo Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Regierungsbehörde für Arbeit und Soziales in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 peso's until September; this is much less than the general government average, which is 7375 peso's.
Reduction of the ADI
In addition to reducing economic activity and growing unemployment, in 2011 the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) for the last ten years is recorded. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to 630 597 dollars from January to June, which corresponds to a weakness of 87.74 percent compared to the $5 143 312 during the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Regulations Authority for Economic Development), on the other hand, represents a total investment of 17 280 000 Pesos in 2011, which is mainly from businesses in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In the light of the economic crisis, the national government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 peso in July at the National Congress, which was to be invested in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities for the reactivation of the economy. The National Congress approved a amount of 200 600 000 peso, but by November no positive effects of debt on any of the sectors in the country could be identified.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first government year Mario López Valdé's government incapacity was apparent.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico), represented that in 2011 no effort was made to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the national government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa was really very short this year. It has to be worked hard to recover this year's lost terrain and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of all, in particular the progress of the already well agreed government team, have not been sufficiently harmonised," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events, such as the frost at the beginning of the year, reduced and slowed the economic development of the country.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficiently moving to create an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine the application
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Company Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, said that the State should be made more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that it was worked. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic vocation and line because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There is a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that leads government efforts to better pathways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas that can be said that the government has acted more extensively. What I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work before it," he said.
Inhaftation due to 8 kg of marijuana
To five years in prison and 100 sets of days, a resident of Navolato was sentenced for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The public prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of Marihuana.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I Act, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican military on June 7th 2010 in the monitoring of the Ciprano Valdez street against the watchpost No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug retailer was in a white truck where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the rider's seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated product was handed over to the judge of the district and the punished person is still in the executive body.
Debt for construction
Miguel Ángel López Miranda said that the social buildings for migrants provided for in the programmes Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 are in danger of not being completed for lack of resources or only with great delay.
The head of the urban authority for social development stated that although the construction programmes have already advanced, they are now in danger, since the government has not paid the resources it has incurred that exceeded 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, so a delay of the construction was expected.
"12 millions of them have to contribute, and although the year already ends, they have not given us a penny, and that, even though they had had to pay us a part in July," he said. "To be not too late, we have already begun with the construction work, and they have already gone far, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the State had failed to fulfil its obligations, so at the beginning of its government time the municipality had to receive a loan of 7 million, which reflects the amount the central government had had had to pay.
"This had already been done during the last period of legislation, because the State did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to obtain the resources that the State had not made to participate in these programmes," he said.
Even though the government authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance was requested to accelerate the administrative work and to pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"At least 12 million have to do so, and even though the year already ends, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals in recent years is one of the most important changes in the world.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints submitted by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Presidium of the Presidium and, by means of which the switching of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required for the fight against law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued the Decree of Law with the details of switching to terrestrial digital television.
This decision denied the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, since it did not receive the qualified majority of eight votes required to allow the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality, so the law remains in force.
In the project for the action drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed that the Decree of Law for Constitution should be declared unconstitutional, since the regulations relating to radio and television are responsible for the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Telecommunication Commission in Mexico), which would contradict the hierarchical principles and the laws.
In favour of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Members gave constitutional complaints against the Decree of Law. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree of Law and initiated all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also refused the action tabled by the Chamber of Members without entering into the debate on the project for which Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In its contribution, the Prime Minister expressed that the arguments of the project should not be agreed, in the sense that the country government cannot regulate the measures to be taken by public administration by general rules.
"I do not believe that if you do so, the independence of the regulatory authority would be affected." It also reminded that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it is responsible for the government of the state.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years throughout the world, and it makes better use of the radio-electric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The disfellowshipping of the transformation, she said, is a suspension of the use of digitization, which is a decision in public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "because they have economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, they stressed, "required the action of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic management by the State, they included a group of features that put the Constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already done the digital conversion, even though they had highly specialised institutions.
It was not possible to conclude that the government, with the issue of the contested decree, would intervene in the competences of the Congress, because the laws adopted by the Legislative would be respected," she assured.
The possibility of counting the voting list in Michoacán individually shall be considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the Governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
The possibility of a single statement of voting lists is a reality in the elections in Michoacán this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the Governor elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes from a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that the Electoral has just adopted a number of arrangements for harmonising local regulations with the reforms of the Federal States in election matters last November.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution or his electoral law or his law on election justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress so that they did not enter into force in this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the state indicator within the time limits provided for for by the argument, nor objection.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint submitted by the local legislative and judged the State Representative's vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", as he did not have the right to "decide or a veto against it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview on the possibility of the individual statement of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM, the local election authority would now be able to count the voting list partially or completely.
For example, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more votes may be partially counted.The results in the protocols do not agree; the Protocol on Voting and Calculation is not available in fact or it is not owned by the Chairman of the Election Committee or there are obvious mistakes or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, the total statement of the full-filled electoral certificates may be made if there is a difference between the suspected winner and the second place which is equal or less than a percentage, provided that at the beginning of the meeting is a express request by the party-or coalition chairman, who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The statement of vote may also take place in its entirety if, following the conclusion of the ordinary calculation, it is found that the difference between the suspected winner and the candidate is equal or less than a percentage in the second place, provided that there is a express request by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the package of elections which have been exposed to a partial expiry would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of the total 923 election protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be distributed over the Zapalinamé mountains, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés ran down on Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday the dead show and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the last will of the Supreme Lieutenant was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains.
After an honor, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila, together with the other people who died in the accident, in an airplane of the Mexican Air Force. The most closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At 12 a.m., the ash of the Supreme Lieutenant landed at the Gray Hall, located at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family and friends came to.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were investigated at Saltillo’s Technological Institute. This body show was initiated by his former schoolmates from the technical abitur and his American football team, Felipe Bacio during his preparation for the abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains. He had always said that to his family and his friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had been in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he was always in favour of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to join the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't take it because they thought it would even be suspicious to him on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even at the age of seven of Zapopán he had been graduated from his family. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he loved best: a plane flying.
A Last Detachment
The Lieutenant of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all honor under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honor was given to him the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the school leader and students of the Technology Education Institute of Saltillo, where he studied both in study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were killed.
At 6:05 p.m., the occupied remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, met to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the front of the barracks, and his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other members, students and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a property at the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military members presented the media eleven people arrested in the same village in connection with organised crime.
Three men were found by shots in different parts of the body and a grace shot in a abandoned Finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the kilometer point 1.5 of the Landstraße from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers saw that the door of the landhouse surrounded by a beige-brown wall was rising.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people in the inside about three meters, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One weared a yellow T-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; beside him was another clothed with a white top.
The body of another person with red T-shirt and blue trousers was close to one metre away.
All three were on the stomach.
According to the information received on site, the three persons must have been murdered in another place as no cartridge shells were found.
At the wall of the country house, inscriptions are to be read that write an organized criminal band to another, as well as several consignments were found in wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretariat de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) presented 11 persons, including a minor who were part of a criminal process mainly in the town of Cadereyta, and who were associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (people hunting) and secret funerals.
According to the information made publicly, eight people were arrested in the Los Alveros settlement on 11 November and released a prisoner.
Three real estates and a cell phone were secured. The arrested were confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12th at 06.00, military guards in Rancho Viejo City in Cadereyta found a car without number plates with two inmates.
In the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charging device and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13th at 2:00 p.m., one of her complicities was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape when the military was seen.
They will be charged with secret remedies in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday Education of the new Italian Government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets with the President of Italy tomorrow to present this the new government which has led the crisis that has led to the edge of the economic collapse.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets with the President of Italy tomorrow to present this the new government which has led the crisis that has led to the edge of the economic collapse.
An announcement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet the President-in-Office, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm government education.
It is assumed that he will present a majority of technocrates composed of cabinets, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take up his office.
Monti said that he would present to the President the results of the discussions with the political parties on government education.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to deal with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government education, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well sealed", he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, that is much less time than normal. In the meantime, Italy fights against a political and financial crisis which has driven the cost of debt into an inaccurate amount.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard savings package called by the euro politicians to regain trust in Italy.
The pressure to hurry, which is at Monti, was further increased by the swaying market situation, which caused the Italian State bonds to be charged with 7 percent interest for 10 years, which corresponds to the state where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Confindustria Italian Industrial Association, told the press after a meeting with Monti, "We said we would support this government after all."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
The success chances of Montis were significantly increased by the support of the PDL Party of Silvio Berlusconi, which had to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the middle-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because many of its members have so far expressed themselves against a majority of technocrate government, which is just forming Monti.
Parliament support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support for the implementation of probably unpopular savings.
Resistance against its efforts or the renewal of reforms could again cause a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks exercises pressure with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster, too.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurship associations as well as with youth and women organisations.
Tuesday evening the session is supposed to be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, as a response to the crisis, started an extremely rapid government change.
After recently breathing at the end of the last week, when it was known that Berlusconi would resign, the insecurity of the new Prime Minister's success achieved the cost of the Italian State bonds again critical limits.
A saving of Italy with a government debt of EUR 1.8 trillion would be too much for the current EU ratification screen.
Monti said that his government must take up to the next elections that are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of prefering the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the large parties are insisting that this should only consist of technicians, a reference to their concerns in the light of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and unanimity between the parties make the involvement of people from political life complicated.
Spaniards have more games than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the buckle.
From Costa Ricas pages, only one of the 22 calling 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendship game that takes place today at 15.05 in the San José National Stadium.
While the world and Europe champion, the number one on the month's ranking of the FIFA, can look back on a significant number of class A selection games, the three-colour team only has the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup masterships) as well as high-ranking Europacups like the Champions League.
In addition, experience with the Spanish Furie comes at complex excretion games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
On the other hand, the Tico footballers have few international encounters in the context of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA ranking list.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached an equality with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on last Saturday against England (the Netherlands 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of Barcelona football club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from the UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian team that had reached the magic number 100: the quoted tobizarreta with 126 and the middle tower of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of Hunderts also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Follow him Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, the left side tower Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Those with the least games.
Less than 30 games are available in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the sides of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not even approach the 20s limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had no debut yet.
The historic gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot with nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett called Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate his twenty-year-old existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that realises itself"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of its best concerts in the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assured that they realize a dream when they play in Costa Rica.
This assured the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from Brazil last week an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will come up in the National Stadium from 19.30 a.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, whose complete copy can be found in La Nación's online edition.
For your costarian fans, a dream is realized when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realised for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and it has been great until now.
I've only been for a holiday in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we'll probably stay there for a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted, and they experience the days before the concert.
What do you say your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We used almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting for as long and we're sorry to have used as long until we came here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the largest show of the year.
Isn't that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the most great shows we have laid in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we like to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and are enthusiastic with the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always travelled to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are to surf. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour, you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we don't set any limits either.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly so because we have nine records and can play more than 120 songs. Everyone likes another song so that the decision we will play is not easy.
If we have not played two or three songs that we have no longer played, we can better maintain our concentration and surprise us because they call us the reasons why these songs have liked us. Otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, so also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
If you look back, it's hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I think that no one of us imagined playing in a great rock band once, and that's even more than 20 years. It's like a dream.
We also continue to put on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music even now together.
We like ourselves and are thrilled to produce music.
We have lucky to go to the places of the world that we always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth hours of the Grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and plentiful when a movement from a group of friends emerges.
A band is coming out of a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw soundgarden on their tour. We are glad to be friends with them all and honored us to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like that you stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) has hit us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands last.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate ourselves happy, still alive, and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friend, which is why musical ways have opened that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and its music. It couldn't be better for us.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew up made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to perish this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of the music, this reminds you that you have to take care of the music and what they have called into life without being a famous rock star, which has never been interested in us.
What reminders do you have of your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed to have used so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. If I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and have chosen the band for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band loved us best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he likes.
Who was you influenced as a bassist?
From so many+
One of the first ones I find is Gezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk all the afternoon about the bassists I like.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge alive, although it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all do not feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I have mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find this great because it is worth hearing this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could work slightly easily. But there are also other songs such as The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have some positives on themselves.
Both came to me the tears when I heard how Ed played them.
I think when you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - for example if you lose a family member or a friend - that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embodied for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical studies
The former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is detained for 25 years of violation of human rights during his government period (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is four times operating and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congress Member and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would be studied for three days in the Peruvian Hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body parts.
Aguinaga commented that, according to Fujimori, he could be grieved for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish this because he considers him innocent.
He was operated four times in tongue cancer, and he lost 18 kilograms of weight. Further diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the abdominal gland, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood transfusion problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been located in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death swadron of the Peruvian army, which was secretly engaged during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official decree, led by Uruguay President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, launches their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to extend trade between two countries and discuss political issues in the region
The next Wednesday, Mujica meets with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón. According to the Uruguay president, this will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collection of the Uruguayians living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," announced the presidential office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for Calderón's support in the intermediate case with France when French government chief Nicolas Sarkozy set the South American country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries who still appear as a tax paradise from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and caused a request from his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chaired by the G20, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and industrialized countries in the world since November. Since January this year, an agreement has been established on the exchange of tax information to avoid the double charge with the South American country.
In recent years the Uruguay Government has tried to accelerate agreements to exchange tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and countries which have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been established at business level since 2004, which has contributed to the growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The snurrary installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought intimately for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clues of the evil bowser for 25 years, but until now he has never been in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes this month on the shops of all over the world has been tailored from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Nintend 3DS, with which no special glasses can be played three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that must say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Álvarez, responsible for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain in the performance of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo, which has been developed for this console from the beginning" because until now, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adapted to existing titles.
The spokesman of Nintendo pointed out that although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "acceptable" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "lightly" to catch the less screwed users.
Afterwards, the experts can turn a "second round" over the various games that are becoming increasingly difficult.
In real time, users can also choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being victimized by the "optical effects" must always be played three-dimensionally.
This trip to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twinks the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The snurrable installer must overcome with dangers spicked platforms to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player raises news in the movements, the environment, the clothing and the enemies - and a "playable" luigi.
Colom calls for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would deliver the former governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy of the $70 million money laundering.
So the process about the U.S. request for portillo delivery ends so that it can be put to court there.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision on the independence of justice and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He stressed that during his government he did not intervene in court decisions and made all the exemptions he had notified.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and severe body injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exempted to condemn the former President of the Staate (2000-2004).
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation is clarified in Guatemale and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was freely pronounced for the submission of 120 million Quetzals in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This negotiation preceded the extradition, but the Minister put in contradiction and revived the case to the new one.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was launched to avoid marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove Social Assistance Organization have led to important results: 6000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported in this quarter century to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, the more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday at an event in the former works buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people participated, was taken account.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with a low level of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
During the past celebration in Sant Andreu, numerous responsible bodies and institutions participated, who worked with the association in these 25 years.
Participation of political representatives in different directions to election times proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parlament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green City Council of Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated. But he added that the work that has been done is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he is doing," he said.
occupied house where giant parties were organized was cleared
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve householders left the building yesterday afternoon without opposition.
Everything points out that the nightmare of the neighbors of the house No. 51 have found an end on the street of Balmes.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building that they kept illegally occupied and organized huge festivals in which the neighborhood had driven to despair.
After the relocation, the door lock was exchanged to avoid a similar situation.
"The accession will be controlled from now on," the house manager confirmed.
The house owners, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. They also painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially boxes with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated that lasted up to two days and the tenants driven to despair.
In addition to the building, there is a Discothek, Balmes 51, which also has damaged it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained Europe Press that her business would have fallen by 80% since the start of the household.
The owner of the Discothek pointed out that the house owners made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the Discothek.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had been displayed by the neighbors because of restraint, while, according to her statement, the noise was not touched by the visitors of the disco, but by the housekeepers, and in particular by the guests of the festivals organized there, and which, according to the angry neighbors' statements, became more and longer in the past weeks.
Discothek's officer explained that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building that no rent was needed for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (City Police) also confirmed that in recent weeks she had received more complaints from the neighbors.
The Chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) at the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested to clear the building immediately and get the problems of bourgeois coexistence as well as the settlement of the district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last few months, the house owners had been occupied in all floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some, even steals had come.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to the iniquity and to intervene against the a social acts in the building."
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 a.m., the police approached the Montral No. 35 road, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people who wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the invitation to tender, except for the disputes about the Honorars.
The urban invitation to tender on the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona to the new one.
In the mid-1980s, at the climax of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its shame script on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the decline of the CMB in 1987, the park became the ceiling of Barcelona again in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that spread not in north-south direction, but upwards ( mountains) and downwards (mere).
The collection of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park no longer served, but Yellowstone with wild swine in the role of the Yogibär.
As far as the city spent in September a huge invitation, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either it's like that, or someone's in charge of putting gates on the land.
The question is of itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also from a reflection on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent subject that can take part in the two members of this old caste, which meets in the elevator.
And precisely this fact provides the substance for one of the rare consents between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to talk about the "Front on the mountains" after the attack on the coast, unless the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out on the green apples.
"You should assume the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect, for whom the title "Tour of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it is not to be "presented as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas in which it needs to be dealt."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal as a "intellectual challenge", which contains "some dangers".
Risks as a result of the "unsecurity that today brings about the design of a public space" following the experiences of the 1980s that had their "swan singing" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is its own limitation on what can be built.
"Restrict something always means to define the next step," i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [in relation to the General Metropolitano (PGM) ] plan can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who holds closer to the question, feels simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not towards Barcelona" for purely topographic reasons.
Modol reminds us that there is already a study by Patronat de Collserola, which should not "found up deaf ears," although he was grateful to the city administration that she has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the guide letter that enables the architects to participate in the debate, even though he expresses his "double" on whether this technical profile should be the multidisciplinary teams (just the right one), which he says, "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since in the tendering conditions a global view of Collserola was missing: "There were 16 competitions in the cross-section," he says, "on the mountain lake axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that views the area in its entirety."
At least in his case, this has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the stripes are fitted directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between city and green zones.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the author of the Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the process that is led against him because of suspicious oppression.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the author of the Casino Red has forgiven him before the Second Criminal Tribunal of the District, which leads the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for expression.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás can be seen, which is supposedly forced him to pay a sum of money to allow the city administration to approve the secret operation of the Wetthaus.
After the criminal investigation, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested 30 days on September 2nd.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place, he stayed 49 days after a second detention warrant after the ministerial officer of Público rejected the crimes for bribery and organised crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to Cadereyta's detention court because he suspected that he had bestowed the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million Pesos. On the other, he remained only a few hours in the mid-security contract, as murder threats were against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the court proceedings as a prisoner of San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison.
On 25 October, the secretary of the Second Criminal Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, sent him a detention order, which found that after the nearly two months of investigations, there were sufficient evidence to speak Jonás guilty of paying 1.5 million Pesos to the representatives of the Wetthaus to open it in return.
This Monday, the author of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother to take the penalty, so he will be set freely in the next hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had fixed the damage and who the owner of the lawhouse expressed his forgiveness. However, the lawyer held the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken and there are no claims to be made against the process, nor is any compensation required.
After hearing the Commander of the Wetthaus at 15.50 a.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set on a free foot.
The judiciary, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he had been freed and his case would be put to the documents.
He also informed him about the judicial order for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the aircraft accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake and other seven people died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transportation in Mexico) informed that the investigation results of the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven persons died pointed out that the helicopter with his entire undeserved structure was directly piled against the ground, without the pilot could have launched an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communication and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, where the helicopter lost the gun, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopters were found in the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"In the search no plane parts were found in other places, the impact covered the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the conditions for passenger transportation.
The area has a slide of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present it is priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for aircraft and aid services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flyed at a flight speed and fell to a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the crash."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, included six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual Speed:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visibility flight. This means that the team had had to have had sufficient views during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the further flight to the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, some deeply hanging clouds appeared.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley due to the clouds.
Stamping point:
The impact coordinates and the final radar recording of the helicopter agree. There may not have been a loss of control over the plane or a deviation from the route before the crash.
Distributing the residuals of the plane in a limited area:
The information available to this time indicates that the helicopter had been poured out of straight and side direction.
The pattern of the scattered airplane rests suggests that the helicopter had been poured up on the ground with its unseen structure.
No indications on fire or explosion:
The residual remains of the plane offer no fire or explosion at the site of accident.
The latest research results indicate several ground contacts.
In the local surveys, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is absent and has a sharpening of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably went to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area that went beyond the locked area at the accident site, no dispersed aircraft parts could be found, which strengthened the assumption that the unearned plane structure had been piled against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
The Mexican Social Insurance Institute leads a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituteo Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) announced that it was a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers should be found in conjunction with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investgación Médica en Bioquímica (Division of Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of postgraduate study at Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at Centro de Investgación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports places of IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 a.m. tests are carried out with children and adolescents.
He stressed that the investigation started at Cuauhtémoc Sports Square (in the west of the state of México) and continued since 8 October at Nezahualcóyolt Sports Square (in the east of the state of México).
If the target is reached from 500 to 600 researchers, the study will continue at the sports square of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed on the part of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He stated that the aim of the study is to learn the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of diabetes, he explained that three thousand children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 should fill in the consent and under the supervision of their parents with nutritional questions.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family disease history to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or kidney failure.
In addition, it suggested that on the above Saturdays, the subjects were measured (weight, size, tallen sum), control their blood pressure and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (investigation of genes related to obesity in childhood).
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out in the light of the concern of healthcare personnel about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in nearly six years the proportion of fat-lying boys increased by 77 percent and that of the girls with obesity increased by 47 percent. Also overweight was dramatically increasing," stressed the specialist of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from the other peoples.
He stated that an average (e) Mexican (in) of 65 per cent of Indian American, 30 per cent of European and 5 per cent of African origin was reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of fattening pressure in the inability to burn out the surplus of the energy taken to us (Calonia) so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the investigative participants was in a comprehensive study of the children, in which it would find whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and in the inner arm (adardosis), which indicate the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stadium.
All information would be treated confidentially and informed by the doctors in writing. The doctors will explain to the parents all measurement results and propose changes in lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three fundamental factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement in everyday life, spending the most time of the day before the TV and using means of transport instead of walking shortly.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt by UNAM prevents strokes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM developed with polymers modified asphalts to make the mix more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs of the road basin were not considered, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 hitholes when the raintime in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City Area of the Valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Najera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, warned and assured that if the expulsion and maintenance of the asphalt deposit were adequately damaged, the number of strokes will be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "stage holes from a technical point of view", which he held on the occasion of the International Year on Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, developed with polymers modified asphalts to produce a similar mixture of asphalt, which, however, has a greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mrera Najera said that this type of modified asphalts should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road basin and thus avoid the emergence of strokes.
He explained that the asphalt - the worst part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, of which part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part is low - the so-called malthenes. Together they give the road cover its characteristic tehelastic behavior.
Zähelastic behaviour of the asphalt means that at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very soft and almost fixed at 50°C, while it is breached at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but changes on a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer reported.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City have a majority of a flexible road cover, consisting of six material layers, of which the last three asphalts included.
Between the upper layers, a wear layer of asphalt consists of small, asphalted and then fortified stones.
Each single stone of this wear layer, had been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles are moved on it and powers are produced, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the street.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he said, "a last layer is laid out, the so-called drag layer consisting of tiny stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it needs to produce friction.
The majority of forces receive and distributed by this road coverage also needs an appropriate thickness and the material from which it consists must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be taken into account, especially the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain is moist, water invades the layer and is only difficult again. This causes a deviation of all layers of the road basin and, as a result, the appearance of holes.
When a beating hole arises, he said, "the deck layer will be carried off first, while the wear layer will only be affected afterwards. But the damage does not arise immediately, but it is a process that must be preserved in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexican National Research System) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the emergence of holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road cover should always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is maintained in order to avoid frequent strokes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research work was still to be done, for example, about asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries and with which the strokes were easy to repair without high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th male title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca left empty in granting the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winning stage, displaying a silver crown and the band that she proved to be a new Miss Colombia.
With this night's result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the departamento already comes to 14 male titles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who almost held the crowns in the hands. Among the proclaimed misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monthica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcére (2008).
The big question that many today ask is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every presentation that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she was elected to the queen of the police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also received the beauty royals Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor, which is decisive for the decision of the jury to appoint it for the first Miss, is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "What book has influenced you the strongest and why?" which was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
"I'm reading a lot, I think quite in the literature, I think it's a kind of civilizing itself, ultimately I believe that the book that was the strongest for my childhood, 'The Little Prince' is a very profound book.
At present I read `Schuld and Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we all should read. I'm reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book, which 'Leidenschaften' hoses.
An answer that seemed to be little affection, first of all because of the term `sich civilize' and second, because she had not specifically explained how each book she mentioned it had influenced.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little `The little prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the favourite of all the consents and all the prizes had received in advance (Gastronomie Competition Easter, public agreement on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealousy, which stressed the queen, which could not shine on stage."
And this was noticed at their first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and at their two elevators at the crowning celebration.
Although she was safe with both, she lacked the strength and vibration that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico presented.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned to Miss "shows that the candidate who won most prizes during the competition will not finally become Queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of national beauty competition.
It will already have his reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty explained, they were looking for a woman who was engaged in the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the body and focus on the social feelings, that she had already worked in the competition in projects," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with its defects of derriers and fibrosis, which were noticed in the gastric area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good diet habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina had not the best body that there were better "but her problem with the fibrosis on the stomach, which was hard to notice for me, pressing her score on the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make it right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a grievous prediction was created after the appearance in the bathing suit, which was to be true in the night. It was shrouded that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation price in order not to let them come into the enjoyment of the crown.
No matter whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina arrives from today's reign year, not as Queen, but as Princess, a position that gives you the opportunity to represent at the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, she will enter the story as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, escaped the crown.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lofoscopic from Cali entered the story as the man who identified Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On 4 November last, a Lophoscope of the State Prosecutor (CTI) was the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia - Colombian Revolutionary Army Forces) by comparison of fingerprints.
From the seven lophoscopicists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had a willing service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to enter the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify.
In 2000, he moved to Valle over and after the completion of the necessary courses specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to frictions, i.e. the hand and foot.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big expected him.
He flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca on Friday night.
He knew that he should identify two bodies and that the suspicion was that one of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore he should take the tenfinger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, because it did not resemble the illustrations he had seen in the mass media.
He had no bart, was dressed like a farmer in the area, didn't wear a glasses and was much thiner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cell and a pocket lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
Another night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the Chief of the FARC.
Looking for tracks
For a dactyloskope from Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano".
Many people don't know our work.
The dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopeists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When arrested, many offenders present false statements or they do not have any.
We take them the fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that at a thief, he had to rip a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had been constructed exactly in this place with his hand when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Wands are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for taking fingerprints. But in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be discharged or burdened.
A dead man was recently found surrounded by snap bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspicious, and in fact a fingerprint was consistent with the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is associated with the place where the offence was committed.
A Dactyloskopist of the CTI said that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a tape is used for taking.
Afterwards the prints are sent to Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the personnel office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without documentary documents," said the expert of the CTI.
He said not all was as it was shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is that shining, it's not all you're doing is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "empörers" demand the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on the Zuccotti square.
Most of them followed the reception command and switched its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement asked New York's authorities on Tuesday when they tried to enter the Manhatten Square again with a judicial order after they had been cleared from the place in the morning grey and tried to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators joined before the Zuccotti place, on which they wanted to enter with a judicial order allowing the "empörers" the new tents at this place. In the meantime, another part of the movement at the premises commanded and occupied a park farther north in the city, where it came to nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp in the place, we'll find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray claimed that the answer of the "empörers" to the relocation of her tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before court, where judge Lucy Billings issued a arrangement that banned the violent relocation of the place and approved the demonstrator the tents.
In addition, the "Emporates" occupied a new park, which is located on the crossing of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue near the entry into the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least one hour, but afterwards the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that there had been hundreds of people in this place where a decree of religious leaders had also arrived as signs of their support for members of the movement and for intermediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in expectation of a judicial hearing which is still set for this Tuesday and in which the legality of the premises taken in the morning grey is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators driven from the square carried photocopys of this judicial arrangement and distributed them. They even gave them some policemen watching the place, which resulted in "some small contradictions", as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had beat demonstrators.
The judicial instruction forbids the authorities to clear members of Occupy Wall Street from the place, as well as the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and forbid the demonstrators to return to the park with their tents and other things they used before."
Mayor Bloomberg explains in front of the press that, due to this judicial arrangement, the reopening of the space for public transport and demonstrators has been lifted. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish with tents and sleeping bags in that place.
The mayor personally defended the premises carried out in the morning grey of the Zuccotti square, where almost 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "contrary to the law."
Bloomberg said that he would have given the order for the restoration of the place, because he had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstration, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people," because "some businesses had been threatened" and residents feared "for their quality of life".
"The dazzling in the morning grey was ugly and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the speaker of the movement who accused the mayor "not to respect freedom of the press".
The officers of "Occupy Wall Street" informed them that they thought of organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with municipal organisations and trade unions, to remember the two months that the protests have already lasted since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens Assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas television program.
Today, the private TV channel CTV announced that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (Balladensänger) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities appear on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and a very special virgin Maria will live.
Today, CTV spread pictures of the TV program, in which Anderson – also for the dissemination on the Internet of a self-rotated porno, in which she appeared together with her former husband, the drummer player of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee – as a virgin Mary with a doll in the shot to represent Jesus.
In the scene Peters, a well-known Canadian comician of Indian origin, who recently worked as a moderator at the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" broadcast by Charlie Sheen as a Jesus child.
The Christmas program of CTV is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, which is not far away from this controversy.
On one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called North American Kim Kardashian as "Hure".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake, which was in a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced in World War II.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo assessed the damage to $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakened despite the difficult world economy situation.
Following three quarters of cases, the information on the gross domestic product was intended to finally conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% of the quota charged for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The restoration can be explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, firms increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unintentional increase.
Nevertheless, the actual reversal of the Japanese economy is not exclusively based on key-national incentives that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan has been awakened, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, infringed by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure jobs.
The stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - flee into one of the "currencies of refugees" of investors who are in front of the Eurozone's school memorial crisis and the thrilling forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of the export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony returned their weak business results from July to September to the notation of the Yen.
While the markets continue to defeat the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains alert.
"You have to take care of the ongoing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of flooding in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the Yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy yesterday, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States had shown clearer signs of slowing economic development.
The indicator, which presumes the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the brake would be drawn at the largest economic potentials.
For he dropped by four tenths up to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average value of 100 after it has fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens gives rise to doubts again
Papadimos says that savings would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums of peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to be lost in the labyrinth that leads out of the major European school memorial crisis.
The impression that the "consens" of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than to a genuine conviction of political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Luke Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days that he was appointed might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democroccia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and, in no way, withdraw his request for new elections at the date of 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the Summit of 26 October", Dadimos assured yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will reach its climax tomorrow with the confidence voting for the new government.
The first initiatives are a package of 24 employment promotion programmes, the reform of disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax retardation.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not clear doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing."
The Conservative Leader went a step too far with its challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8000 million that Athens urgently needs, and he made it clear that he would not approve a declaration of commitment on the implementation of the savings measures.
However, the European Commission, which is still irritated because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu Referendum, confirmed yesterday again that it should not be called upon: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the most important Greek parties would "not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the Troika came back "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government, "what for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knife has still for a while.
Queen Sofía: "That are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized the "principal" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a predominant position in the role of smallest finances worldwide".
Yesterday, Queen Sofía of Spain reminded us that in the last two decades Spain has developed as the second donor for this means of international cooperation in the world. The "Wesen" rests on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of trust in humans".
The Queen won the fifth World Summit on Smallest Credits in Valladolid yesterday. She was convinced that it was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations until 2015 and "in particular the goal, the number of people living with incomes of less than one dollar per day, that is, under the "armuts limit".
Spain continues to work on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it will carry out this task responsible," said Queen Sofia, hoping that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit that last Thursday will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the principal beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The summit on microcredits is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen said that it is intended that 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty limit.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the conception of the smallest credit goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "before years" which Queen Sofia judges as an "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financial instrument described it as a "wonderful idealist who has prescribed the fight against poverty" and whose work they have known for 15 years when the queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet the local loan strategy.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings at the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We all have been able to observe a continuous development," said the Queen whose commitment to this project gave her the assessment as "family no-head" in Valladolid yesterday and as "president of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her talk by animating the attendants to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic trees, that it is a "lasting commitment".
Jiménez believed that small credits should be a "ernest and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty" and that the governments of the industrial states now "more than ever" should work according to solidarity criteria and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to be victimized.
For Spain, the smallest credits are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, claimed "the success", "marginalised" people who are always in front of closed doors" and open the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, the attendants welcomed the "their gates" which were set up by the spirit of solidarity.
The CDU proposes to choose EU Presidents on the basis of general voting
The first day of the Christian Democrat Congress (CDU on Monday, November 14th in Leipzig was held for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it was in the autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who appreciate government policy with regard to Greeks today and perhaps Italy's tomorrow as too lax.
The European Commission's presidency request proposed by the Bureau was almost unanimously adopted.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, ten voted.
The standing ovation, which was held for several minutes because of its intervention events, Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, is no doubt open by the three Ministers of Finance to Europe.
The main idea of the Chancellor is the following slogan, as well as the applications: the response to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected by a strengthening amendment to the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, but this could also be reflected in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general voting date, in order to give Europe a face."
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which were clearly Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Surely, it is little probable that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is rejecting the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, delegates have rejected the proposal to weight each country in the Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously leads to a boosting of Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who was calm about the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win its convention at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty who would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the Europe request for the significance of the "German-French friendship" devotes a section, Angela Merkel does not call on France to the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the highest humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud represent in sick news?
After family aid, UMP and government are now taking the disease messages into action.
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, in order to look at a family aid case and present a speech on the theme of combating social fraud and economic dependence from the state - which has always been returning since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the aim of undergoing the economy in a hard sample, but on the other hand not less presupposes a axis of the right presidency campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers’ health reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government will see the introduction of a fourth day of carcinogens before taking into account a sickness report in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick person would lose the salary of four days without the approval of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to provoke anger, but would help to bring 280 million euros.
And those who were more symbolic with another measure: to allow the public officials an unpaid cardinal day in the disease case (to date, there is no time for them, in contrast to the three cardinal days in the private sector).
While these questions are in the discussion, the majority also reiterates fraud themes, this time aimed at the abuse of work absent.
"Checks will be essentially important, and in addition, they will be reimbursed when required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the broadcaster RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of disease messages seems a little unproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives that have worn most frequent fruit.
The French are no more commonly ill than those elsewhere in Europe.
First of all, however, let us stay with the national digits.
According to the CNAM’s Crank Cash, more than 237 million euros were paid out in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Healthcare, daily surveys in 2008 represented EUR 11.3 billion 5% of health spending.
This amount was 46% of maternity leave, unemployed accidents and 54% of sickness leaves, which amounted to EUR 6.2 billion.
And then 2.5% health spending.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group in 2010, the French were granted on average only 14.5 days of sickness, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
One mean value that hides certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 responded to indication of French workers that they did not take any sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the sickness reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Thus, compared with their European neighbours, French workers do not tend more than elsewhere to work incapacity.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absentee rate (based on disease or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sick news represents a disappearing low share of blackwork.
As far as fraud is concerned, only a weak outlet is achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to the fact that there are systmatic controls in the case of sickness notifications that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public University for Education and Training of Technicians and Engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 were unlawful or too long in the short-term, short-term, short-term, short-term, in 37.050 cases.
In the systematically controlled cases of disease of more than 45 days, there were under 1.2 million 11% of "unappropriate or unjustified" cases, which are 132,000.
In all, then, this makes 169.000 "unjustified" cases to several million workers who have claimed a disease report.
A number representing only a weak outlet against those of blackwork.
According to the UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily compensation, and thus much more than the defying of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to capture its economy.
This had announced on Monday, 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in front of Parliament, the fact that the one hundred days given by his government were not enough to do this task.
"To continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support for our European partners as well as a new budget adaptation programme," said the Head of Government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's confidence voyage on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the European Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the involvement of the country within the euro area" was at stake, as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's state deficit by 9% of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights denied the new savings
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the measures already approved in relation to a attempt to escape from the school memorial crisis, but foretold that his party would not be ready to obtain additional savings.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said on the occasion of a parliamentary meeting of his Party New Democracy.
He had declared himself ready to reduce budgetary deficit and debt as well as to fight against waste, but he was opposed to any policy that would undermine economic upturn.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary tasks entrusted Commissioner of the EU, who had prevented IMF and EU from releaseing the necessary loan over EUR 8 billion without written warranty of all parties on their support of the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word would be sufficient and would not sign anything under pressure from Auβen.
Euthanasia and accompanied free death must be legalized, according to an expert body
The Canadians live in refusal of death, as is shown in a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The Board stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors cooperated with the best painful means, as well as the cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to death.
Only 9% of the Canadians are actually able to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and meet dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government modify the penal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, in patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
The experts quote a recent survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the Earth.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th rank, the study notes that "the medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the issue of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to pain-stilling resources, the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the majority of the Canadians' desire to die at home, but finally 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
From the whole country, the rate of 86% of hospital deaths in Quebec is the highest.
In the delicate question of Euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report draw up conclusions which are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already devised, to make no changes to the criminal law regarding Euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
However, according to the experts who have inspected the same way all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized Euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would lead to misuses in their application, i.e. the practice of Euthanasia or accompanied suicide from incompetent or non-consensive persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are encountered in the countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalised, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, confirmed at a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although here clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadier supports Euthanasia
Let us note that, according to an Angus Road Survey conducted in 2010, 85% of the Canadians had already been aged in favour of Euthanasia, since they believe that they allow people to milden their suffering at the end of their life course.
And 66% believe that the content of a legalisation of Euthanasia does not result in giving the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
With regard to those who have already practiced a accompanied suicide, the respondents consider 41% that they should not be persecuted in criminal law.
As regards maintaining or stopping the means in patients, situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Similarly, they in their Recommendation Guideline suggest that the penal law should indicate that the withdrawal of the funds for which a legal refusal has been provided should not be considered criminal.
The expert body also calls on health professionals to be trained in respect of the dismissal of the resources at the end of life and to fear this without criminal persecution.
The Board stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors cooperated with painful treatment in order to provide the best painful means, and this also goes beyond the cancer cases.
Lastly, the Board calls on the healthcare agents already used in the Canadian institutions to reduce pain or life-sufficiency measures, at least considering them, as they, as well as Euthanasia, did not help to reduce physical pain and to reduce them to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of healthcare have already presented reservations regarding the conclusions of the Expert Report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the reporting experts as "extreme", as it does not set limits for the Euthanasia practice in the final phase.
"This opens the gates for a situation in which everyone who is tired and older than 18 years of life asks another person to help him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social sphere of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guiding lines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health specialist, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which it titulated as "Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is self a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the report on the non-existence of misuses in certain countries where Euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to withdraw power
Damascus calls a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The Partisanen Baschar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Baschar al-Assads, which, thanks to the support of Russia, is a "committee" which is directed against the country, has been strengthened yesterday.
Two days before the exclusion of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had held their position in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan was yesterday the Arab Prime Minister who had asked President Baschar al-Assad to put up his power in Syria, in which 40 civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"Light Baschar the interest of his country in his heart, he would depart, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, neighboring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomatic chief Ahmet Davutoglu, on the other hand, had complained that, since the beginning of the year, the Turkish mediation attempts had not been sounded by success.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and who are not satisfied with this must go," he said in presentation on Syria, the neighboring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily rough attitude.
On the other hand, the United States have welcomed the "destructiveness of consensus against Assad and the acts of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Community, United States, EU, Arab League and countries such as Turkey have attacked an ever sharper tone in the face of the repressions in Syria," notes Mark Toner, a spokesman of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government force in the region of Dar'a in the south of Syria have died, so the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSDH.
Two more civilians, according to this NGO, were killed at "Shussing and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the bellowed city of Hom.
At the occasion of a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim was still of the opinion that the country "takes to the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has responded with strong emphasis on the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his duties, which represents his assessment of a "dangerous step".
"I wouldn't give in to Syria," he added under the harassment, "the plots forged against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syrian, the Arab League is currently examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishing for 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed himself in favour of the dispatch of UN observers in order to assist civilians against repressions of the regime that after his "Paranoia" inclined him, protectively.
A new meeting of the Liga is planned for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan adopted on 2 November on the crises, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the armed cities and the liberation of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergej Lawrow has classified the decision of the Arab League yesterday as "unorrekt" in order to guard against the support of possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already advised Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets for patience and Italy to be sacrificial
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, demanded a little more time from the markets to form its staff and implement a programme that "Opfer" demands to recover the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiations with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to call a cabinet into Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the discussions, after having met with the President-in-Office.
On the other hand, Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Members, had been waiting for Mario Monti to give Parliament a voluntary confidence until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The appointments will be gathered in the presentation of a list of strings presented by M. Monti, which will undoubtedly reach from a dozen of ministers to the Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented, the previous nervousity of the stock exchange and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it is "sure that the markets will show themselves strictly and polite".
His appointment by the President was confused by the markets in the beginning, but the distress had increased again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The President-in-Office of the Prime Minister should set up a high-speaking technocrate staff, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he appreciated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Members, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
M. Monti has committed itself to work in all urgency in the sense of the goal, to make Italy the "new protagonists" in Europe.
A spokesman of the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "we have not changed our diagnosis to the Italian economy even taking account of the new government".
The EU, who is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budget balance in 2013, despite the savings plans that have been set up in these last months, has particularly requested new hardships.
Emma Marcegaglia, Chief of the Chiefs of Italy, who will meet at Monti on Tuesday, also depends on the necessity of economic stimulation", that a country which has no growth to demonstrate which cannot respect deficitary figures."
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as the EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "epochen change" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "requirement of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", says the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his rod.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferential elections, since Italy has come up for 200 billion euros of government bonds from now on April 2012.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Wjacheselaw Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a explosive capsule used with a nuclear weapon, so on Monday, a nuclear risk specialized, American NGO confirmed.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report by the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents based on this UN Agency to identify this scientist.
The AIEA had notified her "ernstige concern" last week on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to in-depth study of the AIEA documents on the side of ISIS, the Danilenko born in 1934 apparently had worked for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Tscheljabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was supposed to have left the centre to establish a company in Kiev, which produces "Nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In their last report, the AIEA mentioned strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear pregnant system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only experiencing this technology but also, as a member of the Agency, had notified that his entire career has worked beyond essentially in this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
The crimes and offences directed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either decreased slightly over the same period or have increased only slightly.
According to these data, the total number of violence crimes against Muslims had increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% in 2010, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decline in Jews' offences, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hass-motivated crimes" had risen to 6.628 cases in very weak size, among them 47.3% by differences in race and 20% by differentiating religiously motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes grow again," stressed the Human Rights Organization."The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of law against human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible member of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, as he estimated, that this could be done by improving the political attitude towards the "hass crime".
The "hass crime" represents itself in the US federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings in order to punish violence directed against racial, skin color, religion, or descendant, and now also involves crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter transforms the platform and is more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enable better readily live completing the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose news ("Tweets") you follow and follow your messages.
This allows them to find out whether they allow them to track their news, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet dissemination on Monday"in August at a small percentage of users", Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner announced before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was well-known for his little instinctive functioning, fitted with something esotherically anticipating text (RT for referencing repeating the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre and autre utilisateur) faisant le bonher des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus big avec un maniement plus comparable a cellui of the réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users discussed on the Internet with the help of certain "Tweets" about this innovation.
"That's unusable, oppressive and similar to very Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function" activity will help me to better track certain elements of my flux twitters," proclaimed @dannykron stream.
Austria
Introduction of a "Golden budgetary rule" into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the government of the large social democratic/Christian coalition in Austria decided to include a "golden budgetary rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also avoid any degradation of rating agencies in Austria's top-bonity (AAA).
It was the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public government debt is 74.6%, which is far beyond the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay does not fall to a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros additionally every year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister of Auβen.
Austria also takes a request from the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government would at that time have requested the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public account balance into the Constitution or the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country that had incorporated such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 onwards, the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% GDP limit, while regional countries should be balanced households, as well as communities.
The aim is to eliminate budget debt under the 60% criteria established by the Maastricht Agreement in the horizon of 2020/21.
Strong yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on monetary markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authority would re-intervene in the monetary markets if the yen should continue to rise.
"When we establish an excessive volatility" in the Yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we did the last time," M. Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On this day Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese currency value, which has been taxing a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
However, the Yen has steadily risen over it, fought by purchasing investors who view Yen as "refusive" in these uncertain times of global economic decline and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro was shaved under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had twisted the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 Yen, the euro more than 160 Yen.
This stormfire of the Japanese devise damages the exports of the archipelago, since it defers the costs of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value from foreign Japanese companies, as they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami that destroyed the Tohoku region (North East), for its rebuilding," M. Noda, who fears that this degradation of the Yen could kill the weak upturn already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter, the third economic world power has gained -1.5% for the first time this year, compared with the previous quarter, thanks to the rapid export increases and consumption of the "plombed" households by the catastrophe.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the degradation of the Yen does not reflect the economic foundations of Japan.
The Minister of Finance Jun Azumi, on the other hand, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to deprive the Yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, however, informed that the BoJ has already launched "adapted measures", which he is promising to read that there is no additional currencies to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the note bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion Yen (47 billion euros) to cut the 55,000 billion Yen (519 billion euros) coverage amounts that it had spent for various purchases of financial titles to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates fasten to the height, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of infection of the school monument is constantly undermined by European figures.
Despite the inclusion of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, also drifted this Tuesday, 15 November, a little more into negative fluids.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3.064 points.
Dax in Frankfurt went down by 0.4%, London by 0.4%.
"On the basis of the new tensions relating to the yields of State bonds in the difficult euro area, the global share markets continue to issue some of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of anchoring," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo, which, on its part, suffers from the renewed fear of market participants with regard to the capacity in Europe that the school memorial crisis continued to last, had closed with a baisse of 0.7%.
"Japan as well as the rest of the world has its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," appreciates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revival of concern about the future of the euro area damages the unit currency which continues its Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollers, so it yielded 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange agents, it has declined after the CDU, a party of Chancellor Angela Merkel who had gathered at the convention on Monday, made a request which, in particular, provides the possibility for countries in difficulty to withdraw from the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish councils are far below the 6% limit.
Italy's and Spain's loan interest rates remain at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, which the Spanish titles grew up to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian leader Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
On the other hand, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is located in the market visa, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The interest rate between the German and Spanish 10-year leagues has once again reached a new historical high.
Expected growth in the euro area
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter by household consumption, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Statistical Federal Office INSEE had revised the bases of the figures of the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stetagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most of the economic experts are worried.
On the other hand, Germany had a 0.5% growth over the same period.
An initial summit of the entire euro area is expected at 11 a.m. while the EU Commission warns against the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should victorise dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power as well as the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take a election meeting to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be fruitful if it sends the overall economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should find their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is leading to doubled electricity demand by 2050, there is no need to give up an enormous proportion of the world's population to a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce constant electricity without forgetting the compelling need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to be isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision to find a substitute source of substitution, nor in Switzerland, who intends to only build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name only some States, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
On the other hand, the United States decided to integrate their park into another unit by rebuilding three Mile Island after the nuclear accident.
Even though the German model, which is aimed at renewable energy sources, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The election in Berlin will defies an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants, in the form of a defense of the electricity price, an increase in energy dependence on import gas, in particular on Russia.
The totality of these unfriendful effects will already be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives the opportunity to think.
Denmark, on the one hand, is European table leader with regard to wind energy, from which it refers to 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, which are differently used with wind energy; its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the persistentness of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity account, unlike our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy is a key role of competitiveness and a standard of stability of industry on national grounds, French companies have a advantage because of the most affordable electricity in Europe.
Every significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the energy price, which will read the gentle statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power to illusion.
Investigations showed that this is a price which the large majority of the French are not ready to pay as much as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us note that our country's energy policy has enabled an industry of 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs to build.
Because of its strong export character, it brings an enormous amount of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France had decided to rise from nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would be victimized, and the annual 6 billion euros in investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink up more and more.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to function on sixty years if the decline of its producer is preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is just as little a miracle for the production of electricity as a devil's work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest level of security to maintain is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a security authority carrying out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as at the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name because of their professionality, are just occupied by the security proposal.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disturbances.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions, so he has gone without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was sworn by reactor construction as well as infinite human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural catastrophes has never been caused by daily excretion that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its teachings out of this accident as it did after the two.
As a fruit of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft which enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading them free rail to travel the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be responsible to dominate emotions, dogmas and partymans who also determinate economic, social and financial situation in our country.
Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overloading of police, court and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "land of human rights", as France himself described.
Recently, the distress of administrative side against foreign students had influenced the weekly views, the Minister of Interior had proclaimed (see Libération of 23 May) that France "not need talents, maurers or kellners from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from the economic point of view.
On this subject there is a broad consensus between right and left.
From the right side, Jacques Chirac, who said in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrationed workers, should not represent a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who said in 1990, France" could not take up the whole of the world's poverty."
The only difference is in the degree of gross movement
The fear of invasion of the national soil by Horden Polish clepper was divided both from the right and from the left in 2005.
From both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of gross movement, which is to be admitted to the immigrants.
Francois Hollande is limited to banalities in his programme, which point out that partnership development allows it to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections, but it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recently published work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive influence of immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in immigration countries.
Removable immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears of the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute local workers, in particular the less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
The experience shows, however, that the immigrants are in fact much more complementary than the local wage workers, since they are exercising heavy-point professions in sectors that are unlasted by workplaces.
The low-qualified immigrants are working in sectors where local wage workers are less trained, the more qualified immigrants are working in dynamic sectors where training is not equal to the job offer.
Positive wage effect
As a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthesist, this complementarity also creates a positive effect on wages and national labour market situation between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigrant floods leads to a co-related long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity of idea creation and economic growth introduced by immigrants is contributable (high proportion of immigrants among American nobel prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in the European countries, at an average of 1% of the overall budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person who migrants in Germany is spending a net contribution (income minus expenditure) to the public budget over its lifetime average of around EUR 150,000 at the age of 30.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring the lack of cutting points "with the teeth" at the arrival of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which should deter the immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to reflect on European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remind himself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed over all the 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, Totalitarism, Holocaust, Gulag, and Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some believed that it was rich in exercising the right of vote, in a direct way as possible, to see democracy defeat over their enemies for all time.
It is known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a feature of mental attitude.
The general right of election, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can become as well a "repressional instrument" as it then expressed by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of violence, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a judiciary.
The crisis in Europe in which we are in is an economic crisis, but it is as much and mostly political and democratic crisis.
The mental change of the Greek True Falsch referendum would have had doubled intelligence in this respect: once the need for a powerful return to politics, on the other hand, but also those of the distressing feeling of their impossibility, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered as excessive.
Truth is that the frontlines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to urge a success of the national referendum, which was organized in terms of the need and in wrong order.
A clearance for the European single-governor or a jump with connected eyes into the emptyness of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full right, clarified and steadily, a election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one knows no longer where to end the listing - because there is only one crisis and it is in Europe.
It is all Europe that is beneficial to the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its disability and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe, which is humiliated at international level.
We are worried about the transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus each of its individual nations.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to the People's Suvereignty.
For it is in general, whether the Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, freeze themselves from markets, and can make a future of investments.
The exit from the crisis has the condition for decisions at European level, which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without surely bringing us into ruin.
After this proposal was fought by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, everyone today urges European economic leadership.
Understand.
But this is without political integration and a stronger democracy - as they suggest to citizens - would be a new foolishness and another sackgasse.
We need to take a new stage of European construction.
In order to make the Republic appear in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution of the interests alone could not afford enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to form a more integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more democratic Europe politically, a truly European sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"contactless" chip cards become general
The world trade fair for chip cards opens its gates on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic position.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessorchips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion sold units.
The most important segment is the contactless technology that enables payments in public transport or balance of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Against the one year earlier 320 million sold this year, 460 million contactless chip cards were to be sold worldwide!
Their market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins in terms of contactless payment on the ground after it has long been behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France the beginnings are rather modest: only 400.000 contactless visacles have been spread.
However, consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless passport MasterCards this year.
To change at higher speed, it is now necessary that the banks provide their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically deploying their customers in the future bank cards fitted with contactless chips," announced Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to the payment means of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearing low percentage of devices has been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) needed to carry out these transactions.
"They've been moved."
"But they should experience a real upward development at least next year."
"We expect to sell from 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to June next.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also said yesterday to prepare the market introduction of an offer that enables its customers to pay without contact by phone.
Terrorist face understands from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is worried about the relationships between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
The long suspicious relations between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sekte Boko Haram seem to confirm.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Auβenminister Abdelframe Messahel himself had confirmed that Algiers has now gained certainty about it.
"The way in which both organizations are dealing with and the relationships of the secret services indicate a clear cooperation," he said without further detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigations on the kidnapping of two French in Niger last January promoted interfaces in days.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, which were kidned in a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi, were supposed to have been killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of a surgery carried out by the French specialities.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists in the ruins at the place of use.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the run-up calls leads to several partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two conversation partners: a number leads to an Nigerian who had stopped the wing of Boko Haram in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria for a long time; the other leads to a man who is close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but without doubt you have to wait for more clear evidence before you can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it's imaginable."
"Man has been aware for years that the sect refers to financial and intellectual support from Auβen and that it is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo softens.
In these last months, these "support services" have become more and more obvious in their courses, as well as the talks and the operating modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the addition of suicide killers as well as the use of ever more complex explosives that bear the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community has been exercising pressure on Abuja since then to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have regarded the grouping as a community of Illuminates for a long time, which has not to be given special attention.
Fast success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which means in Haoussa as much as "West Education is a shame" - pursues the establishment of a Islamic emirat in the northern of Nigeria.
In this mediumless region, the merger gets rapid successes.
It polites and demands strict compliance with the Scharia, while the activists involved in the fight against the wicked central government.
At first, the activists have churches, bars and authorities in sight.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram showed themselves particularly actively with their reinforced attacks against the Commissioners.
However, the reaction from Abuja is indifferent as usual.
The army circulates the city, one counts 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes radical and leaves its high-burgs in the north.
Last Christmas she announced herself to an attack in Jos, which demanded 80 human lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was assigned the debt of a suicide date that occurred in Abuja’s secure headquarters - the first of his kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations becomes the priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axle in Africa, which is intended to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been alarmed by all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somaliians of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, at a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Ta Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem and showed himself willingly "to share all the information."
The world according to the Republican presidency candidates
Mid Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance regarding China, Iraq and the assistance for Israel.
Can a crysen weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not saying: invaluable ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidency candidates in this way, the electors could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their competitors have repeatedly made their thundering statements as well as their statements on auditary policy, traditional Republican focus.
About China, Iran and Israel aid - often undermined in no way - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the top of the course, middle Romney threatened to quote the Chinese to the WTO and to offend it to the "maying manipulation" - leading topic in an America that is attracted to Asia by the immigration of all industries into Asia.
Foolish run, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, almost with regard to his emotions cut off the air of flattering gestures.
He had called for a hand-resistant but constructive exchange of conversation with Beijing (as well as the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not being heard, as he stagnates in the depths of the surveys.
Reagan's Ebenimage
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions were to fail to stop the nuclear program.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran," he denied.
"If Obama is reselected, they get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel to have increased military assistance and accused Obama to remain guilty of obligations to this partner.
The entrepreneur, Herman Cain, second highest-ranked candidate, has a shameful intelligence to show.
Recently he called on the Chinese military threat to contra, since Beijing's attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to give the fact that China has already been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The texanian governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, is, on his part, willing to take the American army in Mexico against drug cards.
The attack on torture against suspect terrorists by Obama in 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate for Michele Bachmann.
It is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auβenpolitical weight.
The current presidency counterparts, Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War despite all.
They recall that Obama also had to be an amateur and give water in his wine, which was the subject of antiterror.
They rightly endure the failure of his naive twist talks with Iran, the premature deduction of his "jungle" from Iraq, his determination in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
However, this contradiction is not so imperative.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance sheet of national security under Obama, which has been deactivated by Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been guarding against military interventions that lead to paralyze.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by reasoning that America has to be rebuilt economically to awaken its leadership position for new lives.
North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seaside of the Baltic Sea and connects the western Europe directly to Russia, was operated.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to engage in this event with gloria and gloria.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, have attended last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea Coast under orchestra sounding and at fine-schmecker buffet the inauguration of the new North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his office school Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, have symbolically turned the tax of the valve, which transports the Russian gas to the western European network.
The new gas pipeline aims to deliver 27,5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through a first 1,224 km long pipeline linking the Sankt Petersburg region to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - equivalent to French overall consumption - will be completed at the end of 2012.
And the eventuality of the construction of a third line is already sounded on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely and point-general completion of this enormous building works like a victory.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, by avoiding any tracing through third countries (Poles or Ukraine) on the roadway.
For this reason these two countries lose a little of their power: it will now be more difficult for them to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the strongest engaged in the debate, had not been reversed to compare the Nord-Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pakt" in connection with the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupiement of Poland in 1939.
This means that the topic is politically unsensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of decreasing European energy, as the project hit a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich western countries, which have strong gas consumption and their gas supply.
"This gas distributor is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new arterie that connects us in an organic way," confirmed François Fillon in the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out in what degree the big gas contracts are also of political and economic importance.
All of this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin as regards gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea ground, in about 200 m deep.
In their construction, mining fields dating from World War II had to be removed.
"Every hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed in mind," said Jens Müller, spokesperson of the North Stream society.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long snake made of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers that is broken by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was foreseen before the coast of Sweden, but the project responsible have distanced from it, since Sweden had little effort to permanently see a Russian state society at its coasts.
"In the case of a harbour, we close the gas flow in less than a minute," Jens Müller stated.
So in the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipe disappears into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers as little likely, since the sweater was estimated to be constant by a leak per 100.000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by a sub-water robot controlled by a sea ship for external observation purposes, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a diameter of one metre, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of the relocation through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information about any deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without being subjected to the least repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their powers to achieve this project.
However, management remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are integrated here (about 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gas Union and the French group of GDF Suez (about 9%).
These five companies have formed a company community called North Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport on a prolongable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how much the real gas transported is", precisely Jens Müller.
The financing of gas transmission was secured to 30% of shareholders as well as to 70% of bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are not able to recover their debts, since Gazprom alone has the risk of liability.
The gas remote line comes on a sandy, pine forested coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas exit tempos.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipes.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Moleskine now wants to re-establish the letter by an Italian company about fifteen years ago.
It has a flair of adventure, spent hours on candle voucher with writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular tape, its rubber tape, the egg shell-coloured pages, as ageed over time.
The Moleskine notes, however, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, who has its headquarters in Milan, decided to bring a distinguished design notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then expert consultant of the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old production technology called Mole Skin (Maulworfshaut), which refers to a cotton lacquer, for example, used for recruiting pollen benches.
This type of notebook was very demanded by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which was considered to be an avantgardist artist until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now more trademark responsible at Modo Modo.
Success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rise by 26% and are established with a drop of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far away from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a fantom image of the buyers, as the notebook enthusiasts as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small, Italian company, which was 12 employees in his beginnings, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in book shops, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres, and understands to implement its identity.
"We followed the time spirit and his new need for writing, which exists despite the e-mail's upturn," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of Moleskine's company: Recently the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)" where architects and artists issued their own notebooks.
In August, at the occasion of the film festival in Locarno, the company also brought a leopard pattern on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural time spirit and understood it to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer shells... The brand shows the whole range of articles.
A success that envys the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the Investment Found SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus presented a new chapter in Moleskine's history.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" starts.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in disabled persons is always twice as high as the average average: 19% against 9% unemployment in the total population.
Disturbing?
"No, according to Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, which justifies the "week of work for disabled people".
"The progress made within fifteen years is significant."
"There was the unemployment rate not twice, but three times so high."
"Not yet much to do."
However, it must be said that for disabled unemployed, numerous obstacles continue to exist before getting a job.
More often, the elderly are: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no abitur and there are only 10,000 disabled among 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of disabled people compared to 38% of the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-employ and which form "the core of the problem," said Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a association founded in 1992 that helps companies to acquire disabled workers.
So much to the real brakes.
Stay the unprecedented, the mental attitudes, which certainly develop, but slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS Association for the magazine La Cité indicated that the interviewed managers have "a weak level of knowledge of disabled persons", which "overrepresented" is "by people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual minors".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a wide way ahead to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was established in a 1987 law.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization who is responsible for committing contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The evidence: The number of "paying fees" establishments has decreased, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The 2005 law, which provides contribution increases, created a strong pressure on the companies, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses real knowledge, especially in the large business groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a Happiness"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 o'clock) the foreheads, Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had not healed their pleasures that brought them the friendship game.
It would be too far taken to claim that there had been a secret consent between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Side-by-side on the Stade de France's viewing stage, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have been able to make peace well and happy.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had harvested nothing as praise for his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assures the brown Liller on his part.
As to the contrast between his representation in club and national elf"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I'm over the whole year, what's not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, leading Friday evening against Romania with regard to the match against France to finally shine."
However, without leaving the note of "good".
The French national team has been compulsory since the age of 7 and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance:"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he remarked.
"We just walked over the way."
"Give them to play means great luck!"
Leeken's reading on his part with kindness "Stolz".
"The pride of carrying out a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his property as "nearbarn" - that France" has become a team at a very high level", and that is little more than a year after the dream of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done very good work," he said enthusiastic.
Although Belgium is missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to see the plane share with the Blue (the French National Elf) ... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out greatly," he emphasized.
"We are planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"They will notice this in the upcoming games."The game against France included.
Portugal very confidently
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento sees with great optimism the return against Bosnia this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams had missed the reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt for him that "La Selecçao", his national elevator, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
In fact, for Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play and serve a opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the replay (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game over more than an hour, but the team was not able to press the matter the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not achieved an outward gate."
However, home, in their brightly radiating Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass through in front of an audience that may be equally sensitive to the game, even if the party was announced as "very scarce" of course, the optimistic but clear Bento said.
"We expect a very close match, but are absolutely convinced to win the overhand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have a 50% chance to be at the 2012 European Championship," however the successor of Carlos Queiroz relatived.
The unequal in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to reach and win a gate.
The Bosnians, who also need a gate, can already be satisfied.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not achieved an outward gate," regrets Bento.
"We will attack a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese have intended to exercise maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "no time to think"."
A good idea, under the condition that it is implemented this time.
