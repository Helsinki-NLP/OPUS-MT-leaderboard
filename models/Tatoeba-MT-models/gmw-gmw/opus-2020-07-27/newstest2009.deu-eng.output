The Prague Stock Exchange crashes against the closure of business into the Minus.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague stock exchange could correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange joined the entry of Monday at the beginning of the Tuesday business when it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time was the reason for the break-in at Wall Street.
The response of the market to the result of the vote of the American Representative House, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there, is also shown in the Czech Republic.
Case of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, a dramatic case experienced the shares on the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices were able to compensate for some of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later it was possible to compensate for some of the losses, so the decline decreased to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observes the movement of Chinese shares on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares on the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent after the index there.
"The timing for the rescue action in the USA is unsafe and will affect the financial markets worldwide," said the Chief of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong move at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should return as soon as possible to the negotiating table and adopt the draft for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it was sad that other countries would also be affected by the breakdown.
A bloodbad of American shares
On Monday, the American Representative House rejected the plan for supporting the financial system for which up to 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion Kč) should be used.
The legislators thus ignored the request by President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush's view is that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and therefore help to stabilise the whole economy.
The U.S. shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the largest breakdown in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped by almost seven percent, a similar breakdown he had recently recorded in 1987.
The index had already dropped before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not come through in the House, the index experienced a free case.
Congress confesses: U.S. government may pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed to a wider form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
It is expected to be voted on this at the beginning of next week.
U.S. legislatures reached a breakthrough of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns) in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system.
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
The Congress Members have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish the final statement of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank said this to Reuters Agency.
The Senate suggests that different information could probably be voted at the earliest Wednesday on the plan.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first important psychological factor for the strengthening of the financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there is a "energy" because of the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views about how a package should look to stabilise the market," said the Bloomberg Agency, Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
According to her words, a final vote could be reached on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with the U.S. Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of uncoupling mortgage assets from financial companies that disrupt financial firms into serious losses and threatens the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the edge of a definitive agreement about a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're at the goal," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also significant in the stock markets that are falling strongly.
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators have tried to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the convention.
This means that investors will be calm down before businesses in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision of the convention might affect businesses on Monday.
However, it has not yet been quite clear when both of the American Congress's Chambers will vote on the law, nor is it clear whether the negotiations could still fail to be a problem in the last minute.
The legislators hope it will be adopted in the next days.
But the law will still experience some changes.
The total amount for aid for the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
However, the Congress can block the payout of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, at another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush evaluates progress in negotiations positively
Although the President has a veto law in this decision, the Congress can accept its veto.
In spite of these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme has remained based on obtaining finances for the sale of poor mortgage cards whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their hypotheses.
"We've worked out everything.
The representative house should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, then the Senate on Monday," said the Republican senator Judd Gregg.
The progress was satisfied with the American President Bush.
His speaker Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "evaluated the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy".
Limitation of golden screens
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the managing negotiator, said that the legislatures had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of beneficiaries and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden screens for directors of the companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to be responsible for the supervision of the Fund.
This is intended to lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and achieved a great progress towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also calculates with help for home owners who have problems with repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates in mortgage which it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtor and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea after the main economy of Patria Finance David Marek, but the implementation becomes very difficult.
"And because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problematic assets are bought.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," said Marek this week to the server iHNed.cz.
In Marek's view, whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of the next week is not crucial.
"Very more important, the Congress Members agree to support the plan and to adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it comes to adoption is the most important thing at this moment," said Marek.
Duel on knife cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any mobile MP3 files can play, there is no MP3 player yet to phone.
That's why it looks so much like it's better to buy only one phone.
Nevertheless, there are enough reasons for why you should make yourself an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and claims of the future owners.
Surely you hardly buy yourself a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear at LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
But if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream of at least one such one.
So it is also expressed with music on travel, i.e. with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a pink floyd fan may be hard to force headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is widely vulnerable.
The lifespan of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do they do not even create imitation.
No modern device is used as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephone and simsen, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse photo device and may also navigate.
And if you still involve the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little wonder, because no fridge can grill and no TV photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more often you will need to download it.
And playing music is one of the largest energy fressers.
Only few mobile phones can play music longer than ten-two hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
That's why you should expect the cheap phones to play music no longer than a few hours.
If you then occasionally call, you prefer to buy for safety another charger for the office - this also applies to expensive devices.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keeping at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one time charging out.
Another problem is when you want to overplay the music on your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB closure, nor can any mobile phone be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can overlay the music directly to a storage medium, but few card reading devices will be finished without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
You do not need any special software for players until you have exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves provide a music library, ordered by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user's rating.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobiles can more
In selecting a specific device, you should inspect, especially after the lifespan of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and type of the sound and, of course, the operating comfort.
If music is mainly for you and hear it every day just shortly in the street, for example, then a phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What can really do almost every cell phone?
You do not have to control the music formats that can handle a mobile phone or a player.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in the WMA format.
AAC is less common (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to call the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can acquire a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument for why to create a musical handy.
Unfortunately, the provider's offer is bad and usually only limited to fast radio heats.
Prices are not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of sale of music (such as GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will continue to dominate the music industry.
Most of the phones wear.
If you like to listen to something, take the phone in the jacket bag while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it is important whether you always wear headphones or at least a wireless freespeaking device.
If not, you can access the integrated speaker, which has almost every phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The most likely advantage of musical handicrafts will be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually costs less than three thousand crowns.
For three- and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest disability will be for most that no normal headphones are involved.
The best and technically mature phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
In turn, the advantage of the player is in the light operation.
The simplest – and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) – player can really serve everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the operation with the former normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
It does not threaten a collision in the form of an irreversible mobile Internet and a disgusting account for data transfers.
Which device should now be used
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) also usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, there are two thousand crowns.
But respect.
In the base models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irish.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be part of the more demanding listeners, take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the operating comfort comes to the individual MP3 player.
The most widest is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 player.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to Czechia this year.
Maybe
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there is something missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't wait for a long time.
The fact that the Czech mobile service providers work to the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported on mobile.cz.
This also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price for a SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, there is as likely a paradoxic situation - for some customers of Czech mobile phone providers, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
Why are the prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it is lacking the competition that really makes a fight announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradox, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators are happy to shrink that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) also often joins Pavel Dvořák, who in the past often expressed that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classical provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (usually he would hardly find frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
Just the entry of virtual providers to the mobile phone market led to a significant reduction in the price, which then had to respond to the classic mobile providers.
There were similar votes in the UK before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has shown that there is space for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you do not need to look for examples for a long time.
In February this we reported about the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers, thus rising up to the country's five largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group of Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more concrete target group.
To be able to work effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, but often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be quite good to put on a non-cashing target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could take foot in the Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory from the view of the service provision."
In Czechia chanceless, the mobile providers mean
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider conquers Czechia, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem particularly hopeful.
There will be a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region," says a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press speaker of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly appreciative to this thought.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything for the lack of a potential competitor.
Your interest in launching a virtual mobile service provider has been showing GTS Novera group who wants to take a further step in order to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-net but also mobile telecom services.
And the earlier, the better.
On this possibility we have repeatedly negotiated with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them we have already been able to achieve negotiation progress," says the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But until now this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"In this moment, we do not assume that there is space for a full-value virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specificities compared to other markets.
To date, we have not yet addressed a subject with a complex and serious project in this area," says in his explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the Telefónica O2 press department.
Further suppliers also point to the Czech market specific.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare harmony with the O2 declaration: "We have not yet found a viable and both-sided beneficial project to build on."
And she adds: "The network of T-Mobile will hardly appear a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this moment we should have already had a specific offer to think so short-term."
Vodafone focuses on fulfilling the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open for negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of dividing costs and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we consider from the view of customers to be the best.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The action of mobile phone providers is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decline in profits.
So why should such competitors facilitate entry into the market?
The fact that the providers can draw on a strain when it comes to something, is also the long back and down about the origin of U:fon.
The strongest pressure towards ČTÚ was at the time when U:fon came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This also demonstrates publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition environment of the mobile phone market has recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is evident that a new player on the market itself and above all its services would require high demands."
However, in view of this approach of mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
It is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which is unfortunately in the Czech Republic, in contrast to the UK and other highly developed countries, that is not the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, referred to this whole problem as its very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible after a contract concluded between a mobile service provider and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
Until now no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classical providers," said in his reply to our request Kristián Chalupa from the ÚOHS Department of External Relations.
Such a formulation would not be surprising by representatives of the providers.
This is more than vulnerable from an authority that is to represent consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one misuses its position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Where virtual providers work normally abroad, it is to be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a lower price in mobile phone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a lowering of prices is probably not one of the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, the almost touching conformity of the three mobile providers, which is due to their reactions, is really shocking.
The question whether it really is just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same gasoline price in the gas stations is only coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs in this matter that indicate a action directed against competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his action on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile communications market for virtual providers are probably also missing from the telecommunications regulatory authority," Chalupa stated in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the ČTÚ, after telecommunications from the viewpoint of economic competition is a single market.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different way of view - for the entry into the market of a virtual provider, it is always necessary to accept the network operator.
And the mobile service provider, of course, has the monopoly for his network.
This means that in a particular segment, it is necessary to take a dominant position.
However, even if you do not participate in this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile phone providers are acting similarly.
The complaints of a number of stakeholders (including GTS Novera) demonstrate that they are very similar obstacles when negotiating with all suppliers.
The depletion of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a very common trick in the telecommunications services, with which ÚOHS disperses itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted Novelle of the Telecommunication Act, the expansion of the competences of ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications has failed, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS need to know this only too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay when no one looks
Nevertheless, the functioning of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are more than one in the Czech mobile networks.
It is companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services but are only partly public.
Usually, it is companies that act in the multilevel marketing sector.
Private mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only come to chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company occurs to the operator as a classic company that orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similarly geared resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then consider what can lead to the termination of cooperation with the corresponding society," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not talk about those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such action.
The activities of these companies do not lead to neglecting profits, at the same time, they are not affected by the actual official marketing, in contrast to the actual virtual providers.
Miroslav Čepický notes possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card does not run on their name in their phone, so they cannot have full knowledge of such as the normal customers of mobile operators."
But it's the only thing that the ČTÚ should at least be strange.
In addition, another question is open for the ÚOHS.
Close the mobile providers before such a course, why are they blocking against a virtual provider?
It is added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to discover such activities, and if it does not want, it does not have to satisfy the provider's declaration that they do not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the entry into the market of virtual providers led to a significant decline in prices in the various services.
In this case, practically in all countries where virtual providers have developed, classical providers have tried to prevent their origin almost more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - one too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies, which did not in any way try to preserve the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
If it were by formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator was established, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing themselves to the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experiences, we cannot dismiss the impression that insight in the competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But we don't throw the wheat into the corn.
If the background information is void and a virtual provider soon appears, the Czech mobile phone market may soon be relocated.
If a provider permits the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other interested parties (discriminating).
And the Czechs will finally not be more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National Hymne Where is my homeland on the day of the Czech state in a celebration.
The hymne was replayed by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female sologesang, in choirs and in a instrumental version.
The song was recorded by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech broadcaster that he had chosen the solo variants singers with young, representative voices that are markant and popular.
"From the beginning I tried both and then with the choir to keep a clear dictation so that you can understand the text well so that a harmony can be created," says the conductor.
The Czech national hymn takes her 175th anniversary next year.
In 1834, the song KDE domov můj heard at the stage of the standing theatre in the original Czech piece of Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national hymn after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the Czech Republic.
Who sounds the "new" hymns
The Prague transport companies transport for the first time on Wednesday to a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter into the history of Prague's transport operations as a date on which a subway, tram or bus enters the first passengers that carry an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper ticket.
These can now buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (if applicable from 1 January 2009) and can simultaneously play it on their chip card in the information centres and branches of transport operations at the subway stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons are also available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was employed by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long snakes for their paper tickets until now.
They buy the coupon on the Internet, which is played on the opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places there is also a switch with trained personnel available to travellers, who advises interested persons on the internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the map," says Martin Opatrný's spokesperson of the project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-service machines on the opencards, which are fitted in some subway vestibules.
How do such automates look?
They are red, remember ticket values, the passengers may have already noticed in Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská subway stations.
"Today there are five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it will be eighty," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls a automat instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays out of itself.
The electronic coupons apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the area.
So in the suburbal trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which, above all, the inhabitants of the municipalities of the Central Bohemia region reach the capital.
"In the trains integrated to Prague, the train train trainers have readers with which they can check the validity of the coupons according to time and zone," explains Filip Drápal from the organisation Ropid. This organisation combines the schedules for the Prague transport operations.
The suburban buses have card readers on the carcase at the driver's.
The chip card must not only be shown on the driver when the ticket is entered, but the open card must be placed at a marked position on the side of the box.
The driver thus controls the validity of the coupons played.
"If a passenger checks the validity of the coupons played, it is nothing easier than the driver to ask for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive with suburb buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends, can go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the map.
Here the information on the validity of its documents will be displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans asked for the integration of the Böhmerwald to the United States.
This is shown in a letter that stores in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the predominance of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans should have turned to the US presidents in 1945.
This is shown among other things in a letter that has remained in a private archive and is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library today.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American President that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" which was taken on the basis of Hitler's Munich agreement to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter into German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as a liberator," it says in a letter signed with the words "People who are at heart the fate of the Sudes".
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - would expect brutality, inconscientiousness, incomprehension, suppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American presidents to take over the rule of protection over the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We can't believe that without considering the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you've promised to a foreign state that oppresss and removes minorities and has only contributed nothing to the victory of allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors can't sign is supposedly the fear of revenge desires of the "Schechische Unterdrücker".
If the U.S. President doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he initiated a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau about whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or would live under the preservation of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today’s knowledge of postwar history may sound a little naive, some witnesses believe that it marks a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans.
Even though the Czech Germans had to know at least that they would be negotiated about their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them agreed to have such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used as a Budweiser German at the Navy at the Baltic Sea in the war.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was brought to a war prisoner camp to Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, the Czech would pass them," said Chalupa.
No one of the German war prisoners who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected that he would be displaced from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš Decree.
You don't think, then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign is directed to drivers
Most expensive action on the streets in the Czech history.
Also, the emotionally charged media campaign could be characterized that the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš ←ebíček promises to ride drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to take the drivers off to faster driving and alcohol at the tax.
And they also remind them that they were attracted before riding.
The campaign mainly wants to talk to young drivers, motorcycle riders, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
Of this, the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also bears witness:
You don't think, then pay!
The words "do not think" stand on a label in upper letters.
And in a blood laugh, the word "pay".
This means that you can pay a moment of unattendedness with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Angel Saxon countries, where you can see very normal images with dramatic recordings of accident victims.
It is promised that the number of accidents and the number of traffic deaths on the Czech streets fall.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and pits for the drivers
"For the drivers, the motto of sugar bread and pits applies.
Sugar bread means they save time when they drive red, for example.
The snatch is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why information campaigns are necessary in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist says.
Even less effective, he believes that tablets that make the drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns about a danger, it will probably soon flow with the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer see them," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The Chairman of Ehud Olmert's Provisorian Government has expressed its views on the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, i.e. Jordan, East-Jerusalem and Golan heights, if peace could be concluded with Palestine and Syria in exchange for that.
He stressed this in an interview printed on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to leave a similar high percentage (Israel territory) to the Palestinians because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would also include East-Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has happened, will have to abandon a part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in presentation of two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "Special Solution for the Temple Bears and Holy and Historical Places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan heights
Olmert expressed himself for an Israeli deduction from the Golan heights, which, in his view, is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some efforts on the sides of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to close peace with Syria alone on the basis of a deduction from the Golan Heights," said Olmert.
"The Syrians only know too well what they have to do in order to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to abandon their current relationship with Iran; they will have to abandon their relationship with (shiitian) Hezbollah movement; they will have to abandon their constant support to the terrorism of (shiitian) Hamas movement, the terrorist network of Al-Khaida and the Shihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stated.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards illegal in the bus?
The law does not know it, in a remote bus it is not allowed to run around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travellers can walk and run on the bus during the journey.
"If we strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a Steward is contrary to the law on road transport," said the spokesman of the Department of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, during the last week a two and twentieth year old Stewardes died, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
The young woman was at this moment at all trouble next to the driver, on the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
But a bus can also have an accident at the moment or sharply brake in which the Steward spends coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays whether the bus is fitted to the vehicle letter after also standing positions.
If this is not planned in the bus, the travellers must sit.
The distance buses of the Student Agency do not have positions; which the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not first agree with the movement of travellers.
Later, this has been taken back, and we have reached a consensus that the travelers can go to the toilet while they have their seats," he informed his position.
The law does not know Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a Steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation which prohibits the transporter to provide services.
The law on road transport knows only the term of vehicle accompanying, but does not define its rights and obligations," the spokesman of the Hanzelka Ministry clearly adds.
On the other hand, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport of Josef Pokorný believes that the law deals with this problem afterwards.
"It is important whether the bus in the product permit also has standpoints.
That's all then," he stresses.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are stations and the maximum speed is limited, buses with stations and a higher allowed speed and distance bus without standings with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP traffic safety professional Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid route, not many dangers threaten, the situation is similar to the service on board a plane.
Even here is not sure when turbulences come, and the stewardess can thrive his head."
"Bremds, however, a bus sharply, then, of course, the laws of physics also apply.
Just as in the city bus or in a tramway.
The safety of Stewards must clarify the transporter by internal rules," he says, and he also says that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company that offers Stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider its profession to be risky even after the accident.
"As soon as I get the impression that Steward's profession is risky, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive travelers when they arrive.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of Stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have a steward eating, but we've already fought it from the beginning.
Earlier or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he hadn't said a whole year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy
In the event of an accident of a line bus to Naples, a young Stewardess from the Pilsen region was disturbed, which had worked for the society for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably turned off from the standing strip without blinking and had locked the bus the ride.
The driver of the bus tried to evade through a sharp manoeuvre, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura argues that the two places were sold for the Stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved on remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to claim truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but it will also expect a financial compensation from the debtor's side.
A law change?
Not in sight
A more detailed control of Steward's movement on board a bus could bring a legal arrangement on which a thirty-eight expert team of the Ministry of Transport has already worked over a year.
"But this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather than the pointing system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones on the ride," said Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of Stewards as something that could significantly threaten the safety of travellers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of police and labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
In great words, the letter of the WestLB board does not lack to the staff of the house.
By merging the units of the Düsseldorf Money Institute with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen Group" could arise, says the letter announced on Monday.
The WestLB invades a "competency block" with sustainable yield in such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive start of further bundles in the national banking sector.
So it is read when a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
Because the attacked WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services, which recently clarified the North Rhine-Westphalian government, the time to find a future solution.
However, the WestLB has been speaking for some time - also on Frankfurter Seite - of a connection between the Deka Bank and the savings bank customers because of their investment funds.
Although Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas informed in the presentation of half-year numbers at the end of August, in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a national bank, such as Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is carried out half by the national banks and the Sparkassen Associations, has commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could involve the capital market business or parts of it.
The discussions, as it is at the financial place, have just begun.
The Deka Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the more important employers at the Frankfurt Finance Square, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkasen sector.
In 2003, it looked like the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
But there was nothing out of this Trinity.
The plans had become public, but the Hessian government objected to Helaba's participation.
The two other houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have been always thought games about a connection of the Deka Bank with Landesbanken.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Helaba, had spoken against plan games about a liaison with his house.
However, regardless of this, the knowledge seems to mature that a collapse of the different houses of the public-law sector is in need.
After the country day election is over in Bavaria, the BayernLB could first move closer to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily a good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure rises to further mergers, you will gradually go out to the partners for that.
In the south, it would only be Junior Partners, although it has been far better through the financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Hessen-Thüringen Sparkassen- und Giroverband, which is part of the Helaba with 85 percent, proposed a pile at the beginning of the year.
In any case, the North LB remained.
However, such geostrategic thoughts are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June Merl, the decisive question of the business model to ensure the futureability of the national banks was not answered by the German Sparkassen and Giro Association.
At the end, there could also be a destruction of the West LB, which, however, is not desired there.
Thus, in the letter of the board there, it is also spoken of as a "total solution" for the house in any case.
As this can be brought under a hat with the interaction of individual units with the Deka bank, it will still be shown.
The second weekend is known as the "Italy Weekend"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with his friend, and so is everything different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter bier barrel of the Emperor brand, stands a massively built bearer and proves to the about 200 October festival, which deep sounds can produce its throat.
Elena gives Luca a clap, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses start this evening at 23.45, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected to arrive at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved to Italians, in a bus only traveling Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing alongside their flag already, they have celebrated already in the night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelcimitate food and a glasses with wide silver irons, includes the buses.
For five years they have been going to the October festival, three tours are this year alone.
Go to the night, day on the grass, at 22.30 a.m. back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary speses, says Marco.
75 Euros cost the ride, the Welcomesumtrunk with Kaiser-Bier, browned according to the Bavarian purity command, health insurance and German-speaking guide - Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers will sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where some other buses with Italian signs on the motorway 8 will take another break shortly before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at half seven o'clock in the early morning on the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already the 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First, put up the yellow chops.
On it is left "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors go up to the beerzelt, it's called running," Marco calls in the morning.
Run!" Run and put the places in the back part of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow coats on the same benches, distribute in the room."
The measure, bursts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget drinking.
"The securitymen show that we are doing well!
Once you leave the places, they're gone!"
Thirdly, "Today, do point half eleven get here again!" Do you understand?
And it's going to mess.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as roadmarks to the trees, to signs and even to the electoral post of a large Bavarian folk party.
You want to be weaped for the retreat.
It is the second week of the week, known as the "Italy Weekend".
There are no exact figures; the speech is of 50 000 who are going through the Alps and enter the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich Police is strengthened by seven police from South Tyrol, Italian voluntary helpers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistics in which the Italians are the first place in front of British (about 60) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
The Hofbräuselt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also contends that the German banking sector is not spared by the critical developments.
For it has entered on the weekend.
The Munich real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) noted in the Dax receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from the turbulences on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that credit aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate should only retire the part that it also takes.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which the State financer had refinancing himself extremely short-term - which is now no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve had decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity rate had slightly increased from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
The current revenues and net revenues from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year's period, the revenues from tenders for claims and certain securities and the dissolution of credit transactions by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only due to higher revenues from refunds from reimbursement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the refund of interest under the order of taxation and from the business care for group companies, the yield minus of around 16 percent had still been moderate.
The former state financer had first speculated with commercial real estate loans after his privatisation in 1990, which had then been distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Because they deserved too little in the classical state financing, the Depfa had then increased its engagement in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the state (PPP, private public partnership) and international diversification.
To the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "real material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is quite indefinite.
The fact is that the dividend was deleted.
She had been cut by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been an important state and infrastructure financer since the Depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market as it does not have any customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending under the banks is reversed largely, as the banks obey their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs for a part - around EUR 50 billion - of the Depfa credit portfolio for short-term refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate communication, the group's financing needs are covered with the loan for an indefinite period and the company is protected "from the influence of the currently largely incapable international monetary markets".
From other sources, it is heard that thanks to the funds, refinancing was guaranteed by the end of 2009.
The HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets at an indefinite time.
Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
This stands for shareholders and creditors of the Bank to hope.
But in view of the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unreasonable that the financing does not have to be fully used.
But also the opposite is not to be swept out.
After the hearing after the bank was still before insolvency on the late Sunday evening, the at least provisional rescue could not calm the minds.
The share rate breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the borrowing courses are quite good.
When priority debts are barely moving, the courses of the post-rang bonds are more explicit.
In particular, the borrowings of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are concerned and understandably the periods beyond 2009.
The fact that hypo-real-estate bonds have previously been a speculative investment alternative, its value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had taken over the depfa crisis.
As long as the note banks, governments and less-favoured business banks are still ready to support the system, a periodic reduction of pensions can be assumed.
Or, however, it happens what hardly anyone can hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that are covered by the sub-statement, the probability of security has now become just a legitimate hope.
This, above all, is likely to make some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors may, in any event, use a final item to make a loss loan for future tax payments on price gains in the past years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce himself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to chew: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before schooling.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, for luck I didn't walk.
The beginning of the school at the Tachibana does not seem as strictly defined as at home in Lower Saxony.
The pupils are trunking from eight o'clock until nine o'clock ago a short round of meetings begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the school began, I was on the line to imagine.
I'm not the guy who likes to speak to people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I hadn't had a school uniform yet, I attracted an old rock of my host mother, to blossom, blue knees and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator, I put myself in front of the pult and tried to speak things correctly: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, come from Germany and have birthday in one week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had started learning the language well two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all shrouded, boiled and wounded and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival of Japanese girl's vocabulary and means 'lovely, sweet'.
Then I've been chopped to my place quickly.
The girl beside me was gonna be pretty broad, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the Gong sounded, I was really stumbled.
All talked and kicked and asked me holes in the abdomen - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of them packed their bentos.
My guest mother had also made me such a lunch box - that's something different from the oath of German breaking bread.
I had rice with herbs, small worms, salad of cork and algae, fruits and a kind of meat in the tofuman.
Usually, I don't have a bleaching shimmer, just what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely novel.
I'm sure everything's really delicious.
Well, up to the salty plums, maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It sometimes occurs that a girl gives a self-made bento to a boy, which she then produces especially artificially, in the hope of getting to know the boy in the breaksnack.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I'm just excited if I can watch this.
'Why, then, Japan?', my girlfriends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said:
"Because I'm fascinated."
Finally, I've been reading the most popular mangas for years.
And so that I better understand the comics and culture in it, I also started to learn a little Japanese sometime.
So for me it was completely clear that I had to travel here some time.
Because I also have a feasibility for tradition, habits and customs.
And on that one's great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a shame fleeing in danger means that she also feels fear?
Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Just how can you check if they feel the same thing if they are acting like us?
The Internet magazine " Edge" has been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness, without being able to prove this, or anything else, where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, as all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and collapse questions of feeling or generally consciousness, we enter indifferent areas because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat is at risk, it does the same as many other animals: it is dead, fleeing, or attacking.
People are similar, some scientists have a similar subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the almost always associated circuits with human consciousness include the side-frontal Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term and in the execution/control functions).
This wide region is much higher in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason for the assumption that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic character is likely to be in the linguistic nature of man: Since so much of his experience is linked to language, it often says that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, this would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be possible, probably differed very much from most of our consciousness conditions.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may appear in other animals.
If it can be analyzed as something internal and subjective, neither measured nor, because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, his research poses great problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that may be more accessible scientifically.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term impairment of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one refers to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the significance of the prefrontal Cortex for the condition of visualization.
What is the result of the feelings?
I reiterate them that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in one of his own activity conscious brains.
So what we call "furcht" is the mental state in which we are in when the activity of the defensive system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) demonstrates memory.
As seen, feelings are closely linked to the regions of Cortex, which characterize primates and in particular humans.
Associated with linguistic nature, fine sensations arise because with the help of the words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorize conditions in order to attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio thinks that feelings of primitive activities in the body of Cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, but more concentrated on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in gatting-wide sensations.
In theory, I can't contradict it, but I think it's indispensable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and people, is likely to feel like this in both cases: But how can you check whether rats and people feel the same if they act similarly?
A shame flies at risk whether she also feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral likeness cannot prove equality of experience yet.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, not even a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if this could be proved to humans, how would it be demonstrated in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even shame (who know?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from those of us (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
At any rate, progress is rising at the neural level, if the same is measured in rats and people.
How I don't research language and consciousness in rats, even if I don't feel, I don't know if they exist.
You may think that's short-sighted, but I'd rather get ahead than constantly running against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Term of Grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise EM with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of the stages, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts turn back.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We now have to work at maximum speed," said the Ukrainian Association President Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep us constantly in the eye."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had come together at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"The serious danger that the PZPN is not capable of acting according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several first-literators had been condemned for manipulation alone in the past season for a declining force, and even the launch of the league had to be postponed in the short term.
Empöred Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about privates - and now has anger with the ex: Hollywood Star Meg Ryan outlet her flood Dennis Quaid as a adultbreaker.
The shame - and beat back.
Late rose war with Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood chess players are now carrying out an incredible dispute - in the public.
Meg Ryan had said for the first time in an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week for the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Tennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud did not come to them until after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - told the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Is it immense," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News", that "Meg repeats the history of our relationship recoups and embosses".
It is also "fortunate" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack will again be "reminiscent of the pain and the revolts which mean a divorce for each child."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid is again married and recently became father of Zwillingen.
And so close his lodgings with the sidehib: "My life continues anyway.
I appreciate that I have a wonderful family that's fine."
Reduce prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany were even cheaper than 50 percent.
Flights and nights in hotels have again become cheaper - this is the result of a study of the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant breakdown in the second quarter after an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, the nights have already been approved in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities were still increasing by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, the prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most clearly in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
As a result of this, American Express sees the weak dollar course that has led to a "decreasing travellust of American tourists".
Also, financial places such as Frankfurt or London are more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend in the first quarter also showed upwards at the flight prices:
Due to kerosin defense, travellers in the economy class had to pay 7.1 percent more than 2007, fuel intense long-distance flights were even more expensive than 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the economic class prices decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the price change in the business and first class was significantly lower.
In Germany prices increased even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
In German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even been halfed.
On the one hand, the company explains the reason for price breakdown is the decline in economic growth.
The demand in many segments of the flight market breezes.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, increases competition pressure.
Signs of the tense situation are the removal of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had notified bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - alone in Europe, these were 24 airlines.
HSV slept Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes table leader.
At the Borussia Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning eleven.
Zoom from Kristoffer Klein Bruchlandung für Nationalspieler Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game lately and failed with a Heber to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she was convincing to him about the lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin entrance of the Hamburg Arena.
Many weren't going into the catacombs, the mid-term break was finished and most were sitting back on their seats.
Rieger was almost three decades of physiotherapy of the HSV, he enjoys a higher prestige than some flooded actor.
And so his request also found hearing in a responsible place.
Assistance trainer Cornelius Jol nicked and elevated the thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief trainer Martin Jol.
That command will have been similar: go with gate two!
Implementation continued.
"There wasn't everything beautiful today," admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Also, Bastian Reinhardt would've wanted it "relaxed."
The 1:0 (1:0) are due to Mladen Petric's headball hit (11th); and to the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summoned.
The Hamburg SV is 121 years old on Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky over the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which proved their club as a class prime.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know this to be arranged," said Marcell Jansen.
He recognizes that the tablelaric intermediate product is more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its lately committed accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Torschütz Petric and the FC Bayern - is slowly able to shine yet.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol asked.
After the vote defeat
At Wall Street, there's anxiety.
First news from the failure of the rescue package allowed the Dow Jones to break by 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, the Dow started a bit again.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock barometer recorded with a total of five percent in the minus at 10.579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology market was with more than seven percent in 1548 points.
The largest loser was at that time in the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of the Bank Goldman Sachs yielded by almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, Great investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
In the context of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers are to be provided.
However, the sum is to be paid, not at one stroke, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock option certificates of financial companies which could be triggered in the event of corresponding course developments in order to reduce the burden on the State cash.
Share rates in Europe and USA in downwards
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the USA do not raise the doubts of investors.

The Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important 6000 points brand and recorded with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5.839 points.
Worldwide, the share markets went into the knee.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's 700 billion dollars heavy rescue package could not be sufficient to rebuild the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The US Representative House wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the voting in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially reported by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.

Dark matter influenced Flight of Space Supply
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been providing advice for research: Dark matter affects the velocity of space seeds during so-called Swing-by-manöver.
Experts fear that the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein could not be quite correct.
Nearly 18 years, the spaceline "Ulysses" fled through the space.
Because of soon frozen fuel lines, you are now threatening cold death.
Under scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been creating confusion for years - the Swing-by-Anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes where they receive additional vibration in the gravitation field of a sky body, such as the earth.
This allows the seeds to save a lot of fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, a European-American research station, used this physical trick as well as the sunshine of Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been surprised for years: the airlines do not behave 100 percent as expected by the old-faith gravitation law.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The sins become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicians have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by a crumble of space, may not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers made up in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
From the existence of the dark matter, the space researchers have only known for about ten years.
Obviously, it is a attraction force whose effect can be observed on other heavenly bodies.
On the other hand, it itself is totally invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, the dark matter is still well a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists we dragged into Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransoms.
In a shooting before the release, six hostage workers should have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
Solutions negotiations are already supposed to take place.
Germans repeatedly came to the visor of kidnappings.
WELL ONLINE paints the most important cases.
The European tourists weared in the Sahara are apparently free.
This reported the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabia and Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're just checking their health condition," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions are well and secure, reported Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition should already be on the way to Cairo.
Unclear remains the backgrounds of a shooting before the release of hostages: according to the information of an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were therefore ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the official.
It was "now going to receive the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers in the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported on a German mediator, the release of hostages delayed because the kidnappers feared their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the solvent.
The men should be held until the kidnappers would have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Misuse of the stepfather " led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stieffather has led a woman to kill himself, was reported to a court.
Michael Trerisi, 57, from Stitians, Cornwall, received a six - year prison penalty after he had suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Tribunal in Truro learned that he was regularly celebrating his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years of age.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle died in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her eyes and tied her eyes before he carried out sexual acts while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Trerisi and his wife were divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked a large part of her time honorably for the National Trust, was persecuted by abuse, which had been added to her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "returned her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she's killed by choking himself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the stepfather of his daughter who wrote a letter of consent, which ended: "I maintained her to bind her and to connect her eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been fearful, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended before court if she had not done this."
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanies Father and Mother, her deed over the years on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for the loss of data shall be accused of
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be accused of the "public security law".
The man was detained from the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed out to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no reference to criminal intention.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be interpreted internally with the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
The person whose name cannot be mentioned shall be accused of in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause concerned with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor recommended that the official be accused by the Metropolitan Police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he published contained classified reviews on Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
B&B Costs for housing companies
After the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could spend more than 80 million pounds in the house.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
Interests for this loan are paid by all companies receiving money from investors including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "inaccessible" that the societies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans have been paid.
However, the interest accumulated in the meantime will be charged each year to 700 financial undertakings that accept deposits.
The Compensation Programme of Financial Services confirmed against the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions who have acted carefully ... are now called for some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest rate for the loan will be 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies must obtain 81 million pounds for the interest rate of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions who have acted carefully during the real estate upturn are now called on to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest paid in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be paid for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are non-committee organisations, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or by lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre expensive
People in Jersey are faced with the need to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the large market price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of an advisory company have been carried out.
The retailers are to decide whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Prior to the increase in prices in February, Jersey Milk's Grand Market Price last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied deposit
A court in Bangladesh rejected a guilt request from former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that it could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Her defenders said that the court refused bail in respect of the charge 50 million Taka ($729.700) to have oppressed by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating charges for corruption against them.
Shech Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released against bail at the beginning of this month.
Shech Hasina was supposed to return to Bangladesh in the next weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-based transitional government should give her unlimited freedom at first.
The correspondents say that even though their suspension of detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of their release whether it will be able to continue on a free foot when it returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers indicate that it will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Shech Hasina's guilt request because it says she has not to be granted a deposit, since she is already on a detention ban abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will register a complaint against the upper court."
Her lawyers claim that they need bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the elections in December.
It is expected that Shech Hasina will return home after 17 October, said an Awami League Chairman on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over, but in June she had been released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Shech Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the accusations against themselves.
Anxieties for the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations last week carried out an vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to one UN spokesman, this was the case despite the promise of the Taliban that the thousands of people who were performing the vaccination do not attack or hinder them.
BskyB loses action in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost his claim against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeal Court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted competition and made it possible to have an unfair influence on the ITV broadcaster.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed to Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB made doubts about the independence of the ITV, which has moved the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Office of Communications of Ofcom have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share in ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, in particular because BskyB had announced to give up his voting rights.
New investigation in U.S. prosecutor affairs
The U.S. prosecutor has commissioned a special agent to address the cancellation of the nine prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice in which the actions of the Administrative Workers were criticized.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, legislatures and the former general attorney Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been disfellowshipped for political reasons.
The Special Agent Nora Dannehy should now clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators to hinder justice.
In addition, serious accusations of criminal action have not been fully examined or clarified, the General Inspector Glenn Fine said in his report.
The calling of a special mediator with the power to force the witnesses to say was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began as the Ministry of Justice in December 2006, and nine US prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be released due to weak work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which caused many observers to view the cancellations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-ranking Republican congress members, while others refused to examine the accusations of democratic election fraud.
U.S. prosecutors are responsible for examining and persecuting judicial cases for the government.
They can be released at any time, but must not be disposed for political reasons.
At that time, the director of the General Prosecutor of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, has been dismissed and has set up his office in the final effect.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also ceased.
In particular, the report of the General Inspector addressed the role of Gonzales critically by carrying out the "main responsibility" for the discharges, "returned" its leadership role and "except disinterested" in the process
Other officials, including the former Chief Advisor of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the consultants.
Meat Loaf's epischer song should be honored
The rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored for his epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell" during the music prize award.
The singer, the next week in London will accept its special golden price during the award, said that he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loafs Hitalbum from 1977.
"Coldplay" introduces the nominations for the award of this year after it has come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there were some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" are certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was sold in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979 and reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 because of irregular heartbeat after he had broken up on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute boilhead inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his voice band.
Obscure street in town, often forgot to sell and perhaps soon
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, side roads and other roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
Nevertheless, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing residents, it is difficult to say where extra place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This small road is located in the East Village and runs from the First Street direction north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty road than after an active roadway.
There are no street signs either.
It is practically impossible to find it on a standard street plan.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that has recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to new extra place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other worshipers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says that she is fascinated by the short gate, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
But the City Administration Department, which is responsible for the protection and establishment of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, is not interested in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers the road to stay in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan to be presented in the next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the municipal council 3.
"Since very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers of how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small road was new toasters and seats, among other things, designed for a café to rent room for the company.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it didn't necessarily want to possess it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the Department of Building Protection said it was actually the desire of the city to sell the road and stressed that the task of the department was to develop the real estate rather than to manage.
Compared with its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained something of his historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802 when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and no one claimed a narrow strip of land.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the Punkrock Memorial, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is probably most known as the scene for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the blogger who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of sale of Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (including "The Book of Appeals: A bitter nostalgic view of the extinct city"), published a part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place, published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow sackgasse that remains dark even during the day and is marked by roasted metal doors of the store halls, closed windows and rainlines flying week-old newspapers."
With a few exceptions, the road looked just as recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back part of the road, not far from the door that led earlier to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle was not far from a fresh bundle of arranged newspapers on the ground.
Some passers said that they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished something.
Fields, added that, in his opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, humid and ugly.
Debate on two-lingual training: Education in English speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for two-lingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific staff in California studies and leading director in the field of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as well as one thinks: Why the middle class needs a selection of schools".
To address hispanese electors is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of afro-American and hispanese students is successful, lower than in white students" - what is true.
In order to close this performance distance, Obama's educational plan specifically recommends a two-speaking transitional phase in training for those who learn English first.
The question of Obama is, however, whether his use for the two-linguistic training, which focuses on teaching in other languages than English, contradicts his interest to reduce the distance in school services.
Let's take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are hispanic and come from families with low income.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of the fourth class students were at a good level in mathematics.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year were considered well in the English examination.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street school focuses on verification and exercise, on steady control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach to which education is going on in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point Obama is to pay attention to, says the school director Linda Mikels.
This approach focuses on the almost exclusive use of English language in specialized education.
Ms. Mikels, who refused the idea of two-speaking training, said to me that the school would have been a remarkable success with a pupil who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, you could enter the classroom and no longer recognize it.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students?
The benefits of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the education positions within its own party (the national imageunsg associations have long supported the idea of two-lingual training) and its own consistent support of two-lingual training make predictions about Obama's answer unambiguously.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance distance, he should take care of training models that work instead of despising and trivializing them.
The oil price decreases as a result of new concerns about the economy
On Monday, the oil price has fallen strongly because of the fears that even the American savings plan for the financial markets could not be sufficient to revive the economy.
In the morning session, raw oil dates on the New York Trade Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulences at Wall Street and by strong turbulences in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, to then increase again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have already shown concern again, although convention representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan that should be the largest in history.
This message was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis was not yet completed.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, the Citigroup is to buy up the banking businesses of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclay's Capital, despite the excited negotiations that took place during the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it was not possible to experience the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to fall.
Analysts of the Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"With the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
Analysts of the Bank have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the next year and decreased their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Inside defendant Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had been in the Jets Tricot in the last eight and a half years more often than anyone else.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets transformed a resultless game into a triumph.
"I've never seen such a thing," Ellis said.
After a slippery game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback board Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect appearance to a afternoon on which their developing cooperation made a great step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once shaked out as a foreign defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the mid-term.
"I haven't been very hard," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles fishing played, the defense Quarterback Kurt Warner intervened.
External Defense Darrelle Revis caught a degraded throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and started him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets conquered the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 tour.
These were most points that the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without reaching one, Mangini said: "Give me that I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Excited brickassie hits his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some hold him for the best long-distance runner of all times after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to reach the route of 42.2 kilometres in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved its previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his versatile career, where he has reached at least a world championship title or a world record on every route from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month Gebrselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, out of fear, which afterwards might have been exaggerated that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he registered himself for the contest in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the destination - donors have won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train runners such as Brselassie and Paul Tergat have changed from Kenya to long distances, the record time for Marathon has fallen for more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had been in his wade two weeks ago and could not train a week ago.
Obviously, after a break, he has refreshed and has not returned.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All walked perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but at the end, everything is great."
He was criticized for it - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Rivals from East Africa - that he was exaggerated in his races, many world best marathon stars generally avoided, too much relying on the racing leaders as if it were a train race, and world records about the competition.
However, this criticism scarcely harms the size of bursts as a longitudinal runner.
Along with four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai, and Charles Kamathi continued to ask for burstassie after the tempomakers left.
Something more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie has made his last arrival to separate from Kwambai, which has arrived as the second in 2:05:36 and has improved its best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, completed a remarkable year by showing with 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result of all times.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliffe from the UK.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has sent out her course by letting out a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners only after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as a third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the strawls in the lives of the black population, in a city of very special kind
Hidden between the excerpts of the recreational parks in the Orlando district, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic rifles, there is a quiet city where pride and complications of the Afro-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three grains, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that she describes is and remains – and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida travel guide, which was produced at the time of depression by the German writer project – in many ways a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is so independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who knows so little about us that he doesn't know what is going on him."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many are still sorry to be observed by foreigners.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and municipality member of the oldest church of the city.
It must vote."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of triumph and battle.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
On the one hand, it is a high-found of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and alert.
And as right the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as all called Hurston here.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Frech as well as Oskar in real life as well as in literature led Hurston readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Apart from the road to the left," she wrote, "the brown - wise modern school is located, with its maintained gardens and playgrounds that always care about Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and always fits with hoursrooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls evaded the Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual plays.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
We still remember Hurtson as a lively excentrician who regularly returned after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
August Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston was brewered into the city, she usually did this without warning, in a noiseing chevroom, clothing and with trousers, in a city that itself imagines her delightful style of clothing today.
According to Mr Franklin, most people were fascinated, while many despised them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while swinging in his chair, on a rear terrace that looks at the Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was baptized for all probability.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books broke.
Together with the majority of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary lady Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was put in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no big memorial celebration, no public readings in large style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-pure highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-pure main street of the municipality.
Orlandos suburbs had already pushed the motorway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, including, had ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"In this time often a bunch of white boys came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston, in a letter to Orlando Sentinel, asked the Supreme Court to force integration by calling for its decision against the School Council as "polite rather than respecting my race" in the case of Brown.
Inhabitants today say that although the abolition of racial separation in some respects was positive, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his young people.
"Black children were used to get embraced - I remember - to embrace his teacher in the morning and to embrace his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and business director of the non-profit group to protect the community of Eatonville.
This could be preserved so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who disposed of prejudices, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's unnamed grave and began to fight for the rebuilding of her glory.
Five years later, a much praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found in the book shelves and made it a part of the American literature canon.
The remote road project came exactly at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public's light.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a saver.
In 1988, the municipality began planning a Hurston festival to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its street plans.
"The plans of a five-track highway occupied the city, accelerated the whole at a high speed, awakened genuine citizens' pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd expressed it a bit easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
More and more trainees came, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to the church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was incorporated into the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (naturally named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly planted and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlandos city centre, it can sometimes feel like a backway in summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, she's 90% black.)
Outstanders looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in advance and certain things - just as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white one and represents black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her protected community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time when the Hurston festival grew, a higher degree of home pride was also born.
Above all, young people tend to see Eatonville as seen by Hurston their entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither bad nor better, and as proud, creative and diligent, aloud and interfering as any other race and peoples group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's Neffen, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to the college to Eatonville to work in the city administration or the police, which, according to him, could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only pass through here will think, "Ach, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here we are in New York to speak fluent financial latein.
At first glance nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens at Times Square, they would not even notice that they are in the middle of a debakel.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe box-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and Hedgefond managers, who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst horror work day every day since the stock exchangeturn of 1929.
The suppliers are still pushing the metallic tea waves along Citizeny and transporting tablets loaded with Muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latinos still sleeps between apartments, like human packings loaded with around 50 arched T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like bar on their shoulders.
Office staff are still waiting for food stands on their beaches and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekly day between 16 and 19 a.m.
It didn't feel like a crisis until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all of the world's bottom talks.
Although I decided to put my duty on the calm late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase family, about 20 people already stood snake.
Not to the money switches to pick up or pay money, but to the customer service switch where Stammkunden order cheque books, ask tourists on the way to Macy's shopping house and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, I later learned by Starr, my "personal banking employee with license," stood for the same reason as I was snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their spare from smaller banks, in places from where they pendured, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called Thrifts (a little of a construction park), co-operative banks and those local savings banks, which only have branches in one state, and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks have gone silent and quiet.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went home in bank management and as a last Friday New Yorker went home over weekend, Wachovia, another bank with savings of $440 billion, was looking for a rescuing buyer.
In the fear of another crash, the office and shopkeepers brought them before me to a bank that is considered safe port, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases at Wall Street.
All normal New Yorkers have been fitting in the last few weeks running financial latein.
A woman who called in my Chinese tribal supermarket referred with so much confidentiality to Lehman Brothers, the Pleite went bank and their dismaying board chairman Dick Fuld, as if she were abusive about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed Concierge of my living block, has come from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to get a riot anymore."
Muscleic graves damaged during legal rush in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a Left-Director of the Austrian Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right Pertei Vlaams, participates in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to represent the organization "Städte gegen Islamisierung".
They wear signs in the style of traffic on which a mosque is pictured, stretched through with a red line.
The police accuse legal extremists of the grave shame at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, at the same weekend at the extreme right parties of the country's parliamentary election of considerable profits.
In the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves on the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an action organized, according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials think this is an attempt to hide the motif of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said that they were "highly shaken" about the message of the embarrassment that took place when the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan tends to end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country slipped to the right in the yesterday parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the future of Austria, the two far-right parties who received almost 30% of the votes, committed themselves in their election for a strict anti-imigrant law and some of their claims were criticized by opposers as opposed to foreign.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, set up for a ban on head towels and Burkas, even proclaiming his disagreement against foods that are generally linked to Islam.
At his last announcement in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent Islam's growth.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election and claiming that the extreme rights of the most politically strong block in the country are pointed out that this new development is based on young electors who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel block for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam rock star, who was sentenced to sexual abuse of children, was sentenced to travel to France and Spain.
Judges raised a six-month block after he informed the authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent were granted last Thursday to hang a foreign travel block after she presented the judges evidence of Glitter's precautions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Office Court in Kent, but was represented by the Corker Binning Lawyer.
EIn spokesperson of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, September 25th, the police asked Kent at the Ashford Office Court to prevent the consent from travelling abroad from Mr Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
According to the register for sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police seven days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a 5-year prison penalty.
The police in Kent said that she would not discuss individual cases or glitters of possible residence in the country.
A spokesman of Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in that country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is the highest concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual penalties in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse to 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter fled to Bangkok, where he was supposed to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him go through the passing control and he fled to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also refused him to enter and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials were to return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at the terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's Uxbridge's office in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for approval, to demand that he register as a sexual penalty officer.
Glitter had been arrested in the United Kingdom for 4 months before in 1999 for the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the Minister of Interior Jacqui Smith was calm and satisfied that Glitter was stopped to travel to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no rüsche, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the large flame cottons that abandon the concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artist
On the other hand, personality
I look in private life, in these moments that are strange to the audience, I know when to find the personality typical gestures, the depth of a stolen view or expression of the hands that are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', German photographer Günter Bauer represents alternate theatralik of some stages with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco display at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the month of the Flamenco photography, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which becomes increasing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' can be any human, but if you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
All normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to hold the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on the stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What I was interested in creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the largest flamenco master with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, pictures created that remember classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, which gives the image modernity and the idea, as the Bauer Flamenco understands: `Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental game itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that is visible in the form of hearing, of being, was the fixed goal of this work, presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the next time.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the close selection of almost seventy artists that were photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to pick up this idea two years ago and to realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of sports' ('SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer is very pleased to photograph people, learn them, and put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genus.
You're in touch with people, personalities that you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the flamenco portraits of today entitled `Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of the El Fotómata, which is located in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa recognizes that the Roma that he just writes is a greatness.
He does not yet know where the act of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa continues to try to progress the project in which he is currently working, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived 20 years in Congo and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred nobel prize winner admitted that the project with which he is engaged is a greatness and `all indicates that he would not have to write the novel'.
`If I had reasoned, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel sometime', so he closed his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists, and thousands of people in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Premium of Hay Festival and gave the majority of the attendees their voice, is compared with the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and is seen in Juan Bravo theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience before himself, which noticed that the Peruan who has a wonderful memory and great humor feeling was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature originated from 'extraordinary adventure pleasure', from 'Freude at reading' and from 'more experience than before'; how he writes and `disziplin' stands, to supplement `the lack of inspiration', his intense work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; such as Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and which `Gedächtnis' are the basis for his stories.
The hispano-American novel writer admitted that there is no way in which one can measure and how to know whether books change life, but I refuse to believe that the literature is pure entertainment, a volatile experience', Vargas Llosa stressed, who claims that it `provokes effects' and `the people brings even more apart', so I asked the writers 'to leave the lightness' and 'the responsibility' for his vocation'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bulleries fell partly.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfighter with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be completed was placed on yesterday morning.
So the organizer, with consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to move the bull fight.
Thus the festival of inconsistent weather was exposed, so two of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, for which the second planned bullfight could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días, and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bulleries.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who triumphed three ears after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same night, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he managed more through galoppire than through his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El July, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After so badly fought, a large part of the audience responded in his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of Haschish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen called on the drivers of the car to stop, and then they took the escape.
It looked like they would not have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of Haschish.
The police persecuted her and took one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as it told the interior ministry of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and the counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the transport police in the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police began the persecution until the car stayed after a few kilometres on the border trip. At the moment the drivers rose out of the car to flee over a road to a forest area.
The police in Ertzaintza City finally took one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of Haschisch, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with Haschischbündels, which were later directed to the precise laboratory analysis and to the weighing of the bundle to other police stations.
In addition, the officials noted that the mark was 'doublet', so that it did not agree with the mark specified in the car-papers, and therefore a arrest was also made for the failure of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned above, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the drug confiscated.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police service. He will be presented to the prisoner in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The actress Heather Locklear, known by the role of Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
A Witness observed that she tried to ride out of her park gap in Montecito in a rather strange way, so spokesperson of the road police in California reported the magazine `People'.
The Witness told in detail that after 16:30, Locklear pushed Gaspedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forth from the park, and when she drove back, she fascinated her sunbrille several times.
Something later, the Witness, who at first the actress probably did not know that Locklear held on a nearby road and went out of the car.
The Witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had lived `Anxiety about Locklears'.
When the police came, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street and blocking traffic.
`She seemed to be unoriented', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress showed himself cooperatively, excessive alcoholic consumption was excluded from the first moment. "The first observations of the officials resulted in, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medicine," said the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an undefined substance that could not be determined and brought to a local investigation at nine o'clock.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona hospital after treatment, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares believes that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and United Left Member, has now assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the City Hall in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had withdrawn last week after he was accused of making business with family members.
`In such cases, I am a big federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out what procedure the party must have to have to do to the party who is currently sitting as the City Council in the City Council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule infringements that Silva might have begun: 'The VL was always aware of the maximum transparency of such cases'.
With regard to this topic, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero book of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spanish against the French. This is a marvelous film in filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for the filmworks.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to present 'a lot of personalities and social analysis' which he has always admired in the works of the famous novel writer, today, Carci explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday will be presented in cinema and later shown on the channel Telemadrid as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, great fan of the literature of Galdós, assured that thanks to this rotary work, he was in fulfillment of his 'childness room'. This was due to Esperanza Aguirre, which three years ago commissioned him by the autonomous community of Madrid to turn a commemoration film to the second century celebration in Madrid on November 2nd. In particular because the story was based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was presented by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filmworks, provides Garci, as he added, the 'one-time possibility' with the help of decorations and similar clothing, with the picture of the 'confusioned Spain, which chose to the false leader for the fight, because the people had been reversed by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand of VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that the financing of `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as with `Sangre de mayo') could not be calculated, so some scenes from the screen with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost his entire career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', has contributed by his ordinary operation: he placed himself on the stage to the actors with whom you must first try before you start turning and for those who did not casting appeared "demütiging" and giving respect, "a part of the career of the film director is to provide help in the theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work."
Many performers to which he hit in `Sangre de mayo' have to repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), believes and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither 'Sangre de mayo' nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' nor finally the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci expects no awards for this movie.
`On the beginning, you think you're working for the offspring, later you notice that it's just for good, and now you're satisfied if you've produced a film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tortola Valencia
A flame cotton from Seville adorns a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Matrtola Valencia: Her father was Catalane (Florenç Matertola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusier (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in the triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhistin, vegetarian and set herself for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
"We don't try to tell about her life without keeping her esprit," said the flame cotton.
Your dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco.
`The dance of the butterfly' appeared to me, for example, like Guajira, or `the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensible and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area," she claims.
The stage expects two extraordinary cooperations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel in one of her ideas, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work exclusively with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Mathrola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The stage also counts with musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas in whom he is always in love.'
This work also tells us in a certain way about the life of this woman, who was known in as far places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
`I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a particular epoch and whose works no longer today and for this reason to appreciate it knows even less,' says Bayón.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 in the Theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Trianium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to remember the fifty anniversary of the borrowing of the Literature Nobel Prize and the death day of the two.
Thus `the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international convention that takes place in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and was presented during the course of the international convention.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The USA can imagine badly without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in `Sensation Reporter', and from the then ruling idea of the American cinema, which was imprisoned, came from all of America to Newman with his enthusiasm and followed her.
Now see what it cost to give him the Oscar.
And when he returned in 2007.
And he knew he was very ill.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
"What sometimes feels is much more than a expression, and now I have lost a big friend," said Robert Redford crying, "my life and my country were the greatest drifts of his life."
No one feared not to make himself ridiculous or to exaggerate.
As a 'father' of the cinema and the homeland, he died in a sad moment of fear of terrorists and of market breakdown, where the devastated self-evaluation of the Americans is on the hopeless search for reasons to maintain dignity.
If, in this hard time without virtue, only a few people can admire, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses both profits: from the foundation that prescribed the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage that died of overdose was founded up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which he took a lot of effort to fight a deadly diet culture.
A wide wave of surprise strikes home high over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize winner, said that the work with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`We have left the largest of all of us', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are trying to live today as Paul Newman lived: receive high requirements of justice, lead a responsible private life far away from the cameras.
This is not always simple or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced one time and was married to Joanne Woodward fifty years later, who was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities there was not to be.
`What should I eat a hamburger on the street if I have at home Filet?', he often shake himself.
In heaven, he will be proud of the fact that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
"From all the great roles that he played, he was not as proud as on those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the vigilant opa and those of the Philanthropen," they say.
The streets in Madrid are lacking for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organise some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not right!
She was called a perfect road, and after my assessment, she was the worst road with everything over and over there.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could examine it, that is what was obviously not done.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick-up that allows you to go first.
I don't seem to be bad, but if they let you do it, they should also give you everything (including chips to avoid the barrier on the street).
So, don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of going to it only for this reason) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it so that after the crisis, only small, much cheaper shirts were decided to buy from less fabric?
So well, things like these are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting snake of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road started and we had not let our backpacks lie behind, even if it had once been successful, but it would be more difficult to recover.
In addition, it looked like waiting for rain in these 40 minutes, so it came to the temptation to organize a people's uprising and overlap the housing.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear in time at classification because of this chip I have received, I can already think that the outcome was wrongly stamped.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, this road would never fall into me.
So I think we will dream for a long time by a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image identification system and human interaction, a nature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the campus of the company). The system observes what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face detection system, this 'Receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were clothed, listen to it and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also organise those present after the discussions into the groups.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not associated with the group that leads to her conversation and that neither is a business employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will soon listen.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impossible
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to concentrate on, for example, on the next version of its operating system Windows.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will be only for the few.
Everything is only a detection if you remember that Microsoft added some function and `Extras' in Windows versions.
The change in direction is worthwhile
Microsoft has the right, the operating system gradually loses meaning, just like the software.
When Google Chrom appeared in the network, this was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Certainly, many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to allow hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or his husband when it comes to sharing something with his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of his `Death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention every time to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to perform the Firefox, the Explorer or chrome and we spend more time on surfing every day than in the surroundings of the 'window'.
What is half the service of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need this, without doubt. I have a small example of it.
I made the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the resting rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached on the refreshment drinking machine: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006 an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used for the research on the network.
By the way, last week was also confirmed that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso used it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing a well-built priest.
If we start counting the countless stars appearances, we can back on the image of a very strong man, with a tipy bart, which had raised heavy weights in a hiking circle.
In fact, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, inferior and tailled.
The English speakers call it `tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, exceeds all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, even though it is called in the close circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the presence of the name is linked to sports and stems from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surpasses all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive Unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (near recognizable) which these T-shirts have as a detail on the neck cut.
And respect, the Belgian company focuses not only on the production of `tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kaschmire, cotton trousers, T-shirts with stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very harmful to use it as underwear.
They're very appealing.
"I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate."
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monthica Cruz is delicious, but full of joy in life.
At present, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monthica, this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, where she is resident and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion sponsoring the Spanish fashion house.
Blessed and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner of Valentino's honor.
A very intense working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I'm happy to go through a city and watch women as they are clothed, how they combine their garments, which I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe, but finally, everything is in one and these areas have a lot of commonness.
Since I was young, I was enthusiastic with the clothing; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to pour around the garments of my aunt and see her clothes.
That was great to go almost better than to a recreational park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the clothing.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and in the samples to look into the mirror and feel good at it.
As a actress, when you get the costume, you get into the real performer role.
Finally, everything is connected to each other, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionality.
Recently, you've become 30, haven't you been in a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever, I feel good than thirty-year-old.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've been trying to do since I was young, and that gave me much inner joy.
So, you think of becoming a mother, don't you?
For a long time, I have already known that I am becoming a mother because that is what my body demands, and I want to be a young mother; I do not want to let that go.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I'm going to give my child great feelings of happiness and educate it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you participated in and the last year have been rotated.
That is the same thing, and I really want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and uncalm and wants to have everything at once, of course, that can't be immediately.
I very much wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' are listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you.
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the climb with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the well-being event of their organization `women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothing pieces from our collection for Mango were auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
Many things are being told about them, as the one she knows would tell you that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this great-hearted thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a hand stand, I will do that too.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
The drivers who can be relapsed because of the alcohol level will need to install the `Alcolock'.
The Authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, installed this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car in a drunk state. If he is alcoholized, the car doesn't jump.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is now part of the General Prosecutor's report, which is a pilot project that will take for a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, so it gets a course for the rehabilitation of transport behaviour.
Apart from the general prosecutor's experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Safety of Cars will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers who were displayed more than once because of driving under alcohol influence, re-established taxation.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhausted air and prevents autostart when the driver has made alcohol test; or if a alcohol concentration is detected higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1 000, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices have been prevented by 65% of the rule infringements in the first year following its introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to attack this behaviour before it becomes a crime.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legal reform can be achieved in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required for the criminal prosecution process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, not in any business, although it has already been built in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Members will be voted tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Worker Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been made in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-tos'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time planned by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force traveling with Prince and Prince of Asturia.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple that went out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours ago I had asked a taxi driver on the street, whether he knew that the prince and prince of Asturia visited the city to formalise the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people at the airport at this time you're from here or something.
No, she's the Spanish, but she's been living here for a few years.
-Aw, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and prince of Asturia is and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the Hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 soldiers of the Navy, who give honoral salve.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair wound by the wind, without ordinary `peep-toes', maybe she was told that a thunder is expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official sequence is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from the Mexican television waiting for them that likes to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no very excellent fashion designer and bonusers than Valentine.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the show window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris yesterday and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
So many events have happened that are associated with the fact that you would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken down by pain, because his brother recently died, breezes together. He attracted the suit from the fashion house and cherished some jewelry of ELAH that were stunning. He kept himself at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters large and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended with the baron of Rotschild without jackets, for they borrowed the lady.
Dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a stage and made a kind of `grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace's premises, but she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone before.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always calls for a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own beds and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starous sky of Paris.
Oh, la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There is not 1000, but a way more to forget us chaotic everyday life.
And if there are few, all are gathered in a book that says how to get to relax. The book comes into the books on September 30th.
The alarmer is a punishment when he sounds at 7:00 a.m., but even worse the idea seems to come back into the hectic rhythm, which the current life requires to come in.
The office is called the tension and the computer leading to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to fight the daily exhaustion and the problems of dismantling from the working world.
However, the number rises, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to Yoga chairs, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott represents in the book the whole list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and thus the tranquility that the book conveys comes into the books of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to reach the rest in such areas as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual rejects such faith.
Furthermore, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or suggest the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talk in sleep
Some children speak at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be afraid, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleeping disorder called the talk in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you were told that you talked at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, one time a week, one time a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no reason that causes this appearance.
There are often links with other appearances in sleep, such as nightmare, panic anxiety at night, Enuresis noctura (night beds), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stress situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper or it can be quite a opposite (shouts, wines, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended that the child be monitored and advised with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus arises.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleeping disorder that can be treated (e.g., sleep-apnoe or stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple prevention measures:
Don't try to stimulate the child before sleeping.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are horrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
Once the talk occurs in sleep, the tranquility tries to keep.
Remember that it is harmless for the child, and the next day it will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will take it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
If it shows fear after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to consult or find out what reason the child has for fear.
If they understand what it says (what isn't that usual), the child does not put pressure in order to perform a hearing and get out more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything, because if the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says, that is why they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that you draw from it.
Maybe, don't tell the child that you're hearing it at night and knowing his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that takes only a few minutes.
Illusions...
After a long thirsty track, ill houses on the field are finally again on a success course.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played numerous torchances and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, when the attackers were trying to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack of the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot was close to the angle, ill houses should dominate the game with lightness, and it was only a change of fonder flick with a distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot to challenge Denmark's defense.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, leaving only the vivid Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second mid-term should be crucial with first two torchances fought by Riahi and Temporal, and right afterwards with the first gate for the ill houses through Marais, which was exactly right to accept a ball that had been defensed in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the illhusian gatekeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, making it necessary for his teammates to continue to play underpaid.
However, Denmark did not know how to use this and did not face any major problems of an illhaeusian elephant, which only took a little back to `verdichting' their defense, except in the last seconds of the game in which the ball passed very close to the late after a great intersection.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flees to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make an abbreviation to the Bretagne.
In view of the determined position of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to find themselves in the port of Guilvinec in Finistère to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'concreted proposals'.
The president's visit will take place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee established by the British fishermen in order to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the Diesel Prize, which has reached an average record value of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elysée Palace David Martinon, "the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies become competitive again and secure the working conditions and payments of seafarers".
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led to the Morbihan and Calvados protest fair, which caused barriers of almost ten kilometres of length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not abort.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated with a lock.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tyres and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the sleeve channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish kutter did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the trade ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the major total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec Crisis Committee has to decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the debate planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the representatives of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give up at any point' and 'will not go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on Diesel costs the litre currently about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.

Embraer holds its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 airplanes delivered this year, despite the threatening recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, holds its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 airplanes delivered, reaffirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its planes of scale from 30 to 120 seats.
So far, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider spending more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of Financial Times, the Insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, considers that more than 15% of its assets are depreciated to pay back the $85 billion that were put forward to it.
AIG is willing to control the sale of a large part of its businesses, beyond their life insurance at international level and their age provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the Administrative Board of AIG met Sunday evening to check possible sales.
There was no confirmation at the AIG.
Among the assets of which AIG might divide, their aircraft-leasing-Filial International Lease Financial Corp., their share of 59% in Transatlantic Holding's return insurance, as well as their real estate and their investment in the Private Equity, the FT further explains.
With regard to this sales, no final decision was taken, FT continues.
AIG has to act quickly on sales in order to repay credits of more than 85 billion, which it has granted to the Federal Reserve, also on the risk that the US authorities receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders are lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday after the Representative Chamber rejected Paulson's plan for the saving of banks, a historical case of the courses: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of almost 800 points before, and the afternoon 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As far as the points are concerned, the strongest case of his history (684,81 points) was recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the day of trade decline after the terror attacks of 11 September.
According to the final figures, the Index of the Netherlands, mainly technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1.983.73, and the widespread Standard & Poors Index of 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks through the Chamber of Deputies, which should again allow some stability on the markets, Wall Street broke together, which had already been attacked at the beginning of the quarter.
On the other hand, with 228 votes, and 205 members refused to finance secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`Here is a bad picture that represents the Congress as incapable of adopting a plan', said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market counted on this plan," she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days `to late' comes.
`If the project is actually condemned to fail (...), it will be quickly the task of the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, the Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis into control, which would limit the credit conditions more', Brian Bethune warned, Head of Economics at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day that passes, the ruin of a financial company' in the United States 'take up'.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the American authorities planned the purchasing of the banking operations of Wachovia by its competitors Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are not only faced by an American but a global crisis, the analyst of FTN Financial added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenues of the State Cash have decreased from 3.632% on Friday evening to 3.827% within a period of 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357% on Friday.
Obama, winner by points in the first television double
At the first debate of the two candidates for the White House from Friday, another one followed to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television double for the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats, which should be persecuted by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although very likely, was not `brillant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the election surveys five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, from which a survey was published on Saturday, according to Obama with five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democrat makes clearly the better figure.
With the still unentrusted voters, so those on whom it comes now, Obama came out with 39% as winners from the surveys, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as winners.
Obama should be able to confirm his advantage on Thursday with the good performance of his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
`It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to focus on his inconsistent experience in the field of foreign policy, and thereby clearly underlined the 'naturality' of his opponent regarding these questions, which was the center of this first television document.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he emphasized several times.
`I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president' he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican advertisement since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself shortly and precisely without being put out of the text.
He stressed his ability to make good decisions and renew the image that the world has of the United States.
`McCain has still not understood Obama, on the other hand', this weekend a democratic electoral advertisement, in which Republican was accused of not having recorded the complete extent of the crisis that lasts on the 'American from the street'.
During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama pleaded 20,000 people yesterday, who had gathered in streaming rain during a election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'medicinal status' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, which the Americans think most suitable to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
"The next week could represent a decisive turning point", estimated yesterday the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative of Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton Government, compared the good economic instincts' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After once again he stressed that he would even be able to reduce the taxes on 95% of Americans despite the variations at Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energetic independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, was the priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to create a 45 nuclear power plant by 2030.
The two candidates considerably address the questions of the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (470 billion), which was adopted yesterday evening by the convention and is extremely unpopular with the people.
`Have you noticed that a choice took place in Minsk?'
Youths and Oppositional demonstrated Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Some hundred white tubes gathered Sunday evening since the closure of the elections on the Minsk marketplace to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, numerous youths had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator is supposed to reverse'.
Some admit that they haven't chosen at all: 'What's the benefit if they do with my voice what they want?' says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown the foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is willing to perform a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-existence of Visa for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the cessation of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were estimated by the observers as clean.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
`We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the censorship', regretted Juri Potemkin, press speakers of the Union of democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetical change, Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of pro-Europe movement, for it is important to say the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If Members of the opposition enter into Parliament, then because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals.
The opposition is therefore guilty of intervening in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is strongly debted to Russia, becomes a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we are at risk of becoming a protector of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the process of election, does not recognise the choice as valid.
It emphasizes that the number of votes is too high and that the extension of votes in advance (26% of Minsk's voters) has made the way for any type of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that a choice has taken place?, the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August this year.
No one was in the electoral areas.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most closely in line with the ideas of the government.
The silence of the night decreases again over the October square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the central election committee congratulate themselves on their success.
Discussion - From Blood that was again secured
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her founding, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the most safe and efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she regained the public's confidence, which was severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the blood donation service of the Canadian red cross were contaminated with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada in February 1994 initiated a public investigation conducted by Judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and drafting directives to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever still hesitated to submit his report, several provinces at that time put a committee on the legs whose aim was to develop a new system for the management of blood conservation in Canada.
In Quebec, the Committee of Gélineau completed this order.
According to the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, almost 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
With the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood conservation and through work in this field during the following years, we have regained public confidence before proudly emphasizes that in early 2008 almost 94% of Quebec’s trust in Hema-Quebec was now in the midst of 2008.
Dr. Décary, however, maintains in consciousness that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its founding on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec acts according to the principle of caution.
At this time, we have experienced the emergence of numerous cases of human form of bovine maleness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been headed since the founding of 1998.
And we did not have the least idea whether this disease could be transferred over blood.
So we called on one of the main directives of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which, as a result of exclusion measures, if we do not know this and if a disease is slowly progressing, as is evidently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had stopped in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it has been proved that this disease is transferred over blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution we applied has quite a sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique to detect HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which enable it to demonstrate the virus’s presence directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the previously used tests.
The NST enabled it to shorten the incubation time between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be demonstrated by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognise this, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one of 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
`In other words, this means that 12 million blood conservations should be distributed before someone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributed between 400.000 and 500.000 blood conservations each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs in which HIV was transferred over a blood conservation.
I believe you can feel comfortable today when you get or write a blood transfusion to restore your health," says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what disease agents can get into the system.
Only last year the Chikungunya virus has appeared on the island of Réunion, which is transmitted through insects through the blood, just like the West Nile virus.
We have to monitor continuously," continues Dr. Décary before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec, in addition to a safe supply, also needs to provide adequate supply.
`The need increases because the population ages.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or blood plates.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, of which, on average, only 3% of Quebec's blood donated inhabitants are.'
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who provide their blood are not accepted because, for example, they are sick of AIDS or malaria, and whoever traveled to a country where malaria is spread is excluded from the donation of blood for a year.
`With this 3% we create an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
No stocks are very rare.
But you need to renew the members of this donor network when they grow older and can no longer donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and to bring them to become regular donors.
Nowadays, life is so hectic that one seldom finds time to spend an hour in the donation of blood," regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conservations but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which are almost exclusively used in heavy burning injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public navel navel blood bank of Quebec.
The navel snail, which was previously considered biomedical waste, is rich in stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
`A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth navel snail blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand annually.
`We should probably begin to make it available for transplants at the beginning of the next year', explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of navel blood loss as very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the Semi-final
Montreal's Impact last night, thanks to a 3 to 1-section (4 to 3 with all gates) against the sounders from Seattle at the second and decide to play the Quarter Final series in the Saputo-Stadion, in which the overall gate ratio counted, qualify for the semi-final round of the excretion games of the first league of the USL.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the ninetiest minute.
After a first half-time without gate for both the one and the other side, the middle field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other matches for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the sounders.
Remember that at the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact, Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattles had introduced a 2 to 1 deposit.
In the semi-final Impact is measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 victories in the replay in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps still entered the semi-final round with a total port ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to deal with the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
Number 1-Trio of the Canadian team is willing to attack the season.
Last night, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Placeanec and Andrej Kostitsyn pushed the attack on the Panther from Florida with a stormfire, which led to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, placeanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a passport in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only gate of all shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game so I can feel. '
`He has fixed himself too much on it in the first half, said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a stormy applause. '
Charest sits on the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the initiation of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister for Health, Yves Bolduc (Linke), attempted to be elected in today's sub-election.
`In the course of our last large border in the north: This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following all the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected after him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, viewed by Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great resources as during the election period.
By the way of the press, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he will hold the elections this autumn, even if he said that his date calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision', which the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic space', which provides for an agreement with France on workers, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned in recent times in the speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49st latitude - had never been a topic of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explain why the north was a jewel with enormous potential, but did not mention a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
There are a few views on what could be done more: especially on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to the listing of Mr Charests, the north has `Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `Gebiet twice as large as France' is near, is in Quebec.
It's not just in our vicinity, it's in us', he emphasized how to show clearly that he is looking for a national grounding room.
Quebec has grown very through his connection to the north, he stressed: the road to the gold in Abitibi, Quebec's technology, the James Bay.
`It belongs to us, it's our future,' he added, after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s area, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always requested, said the Prime Minister to the press.
`This is a traditional attitude that persecuted all governments.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is given, I will resume this position on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, 'with climate change, we need to reconsider our vision from the north', he explained and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be available throughout the year due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the region, the indigenous people and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that Quebec's government would deal with them very carefully and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pecist member of Ungava) have already initiated consultations with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee, led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Earth treasures) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity in which 'man will create a common vision'.
The development of the north will continue in line with the principles of sustainable development.
He promised that the plan of North will be `proved, regulated and environmentally friendly'.
Jean Charest described this `Vision' as if it were a continuation of the liberal Prime Minister who were in charge of him.
`As the Liberals who were in charge of us, we have thought about turning the challenges into new growth and development chicks.
By the way, this was one of the ever-introduced topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the adopted decisions provides for the rename of the power plant of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
`From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about reading that reached the silent revolution and the state of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Book, always knew our party to determine the future', Jean Charest explained.
The press against he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Water Power Staudamm Eastmain1a-Ruper project, Mr Charest stresses that its operation was planned for 2012.
"This remains among us, but I'm about to be there," he entrusted with his party members, which brought up with those convenience towers.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, in fact, has not yet excluded the possibility of holding a choice this autumn, which is possible from the law.
He stressed, however, that its calendar is full, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend gave the liberal party head a platform of nationalistic plans, especially from 'the Constitution', which was adopted without delay: the PLQ calls for the recognition of 'special Quebecs' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canada's broadcasting and remote communication and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were included with skepsis.
The Chief of Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has rebuilt the policy to develop the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry Government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done it, we would already be much further today, Ms. Marois judged on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has decided to support the adoption of a North plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this is not just a big idea," said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letters - An engraved country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' minister (which irony) in the cabinet of Harper, it was who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has led a non-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with smash, says just as much about the people around the Prime Minister, as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do this with a government that was the only one in all the countries concerned who did not get home to their countrymen in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was another younger than the things that were being thrown to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its words and lets a child soldier fight under inhumane conditions.
The only one who goes down to a parody of justice in order to estimate the debt of the defendant.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian lawyers are calling to get Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair process in Canada.
This government also closes its eyes to the torture: It is little interested that a young adult will certainly have been broken for ever after so many years of pain.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing a hometrack of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly bears like a flag in front of itself, and that sounds so nonsense from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen can be abused, tortured and imprisoned in arbitrary manner, even after a government chief who is only supported by the minority until now (may he be entirely part of the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation at a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has dismissed the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this dismissal, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The orwellic speech of Barrick Gold
In her edition of 17 September Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orwell logic that the world's largest Golden Winning Society aimed to open a 'public transparent debate' against three authors and a small mediumless publishing house.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of blasphemy, but in the case of the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely evaporated by Mr Garver.
For for Barrick Gold is the best way to lead a public debate to drive everyone into the ruin who dares to represent one of their opposed opinions.
No matter how the process is expected, the authors and the publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight against a army of lawyers who are paid from the almost inexperienced bags of the gold mine.
The tactics in these unequal fights are often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a consential regime that makes the opposite to death and also dissuades anyone who dares to consider the question again.
If Barrick had really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast, what is going on in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold works, is usually being debated in Canada by the exchange of ideas and not by knuppelshiebe.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had opened their books and documents and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams that could have brought light into this question.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wise the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a public debate at the same time, but do the opinions just disagree with this public?
It seems that this word in the world of the Vice-President includes only the generous lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very beautiful view of the term.
In democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not understand - is that the public, who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does this especially because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many observe as a knees complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold just addressed a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they demand that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from the surreal speech of Mr Garver, the claim of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the finding of truth, which is fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies in this world, who else can do that then?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment, which we are, has long been aware of getting into control of debates and disagreements and resolving conflicts.
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, unlike what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that restrict this kind of unjustified action.
Rescue action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The administration of Bush and the leading Congress Members, Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s yesterday.
The new version of the plan of more than 700 billion US dollars, which is intended to stop the financial crisis that has been shocking Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two congress chambers.
The main content is: a better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public funds used to reduce the number of houses held on the basis of payment residues, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the leading employees of the assisted companies.
U.S. financial secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, and the representatives of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the market," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"It happened all to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis at Wall Street," said democratics.
`This is the basic point: If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and the turmoil in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that had had been a re-break of the mood of investors.
The time limit agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who had not participated lately in the negotiations, showed themselves rather as supporters of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction that they had to be dealt with in this extreme way.
The democratic senator Barrack Obama was on the addition of certain provisions for agreement, especially those which would allow the owners to keep their homes and those who concern the salaries of the leaders of the companies saved by the State.
`If the taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the lack of responsibility of certain persons, that is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary', he explained on the American television stations.
When he was asked on another broadcaster whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain answered: `I would like to know the details, but I hope so.
`The principles I have read [show] that this is one thing that we all will have to digest, and with which we will be able to advance.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at using the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis caused by the placing of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage credits (subprime) before extending to further forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally in a freezing of financial power and in the ruins of banks and monetary institutions.
A group of Republican Members had failed the first attempt last week to agree.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `toxic' assets of society in distress are only secured by the government and are not to be purchased, one believes that they escape the sackgasse.
In order to round out the perspective for all of them at the convention, one has also been added that if the government should make losses with this programme within five years, it would then be able to raise new taxes in order to retain its capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which can add to another 100 billion if the President sees it necessary.
The payment of further 350 billion must be adopted in a renewed vote from the Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him into dividends in the case of profits and can sell it again when the storm has passed over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to terminate the penalty procedures relating to the apartments bound to the real estate credits covered by this plan, and to establish time limits for repayment and determinations paid to the leading employees of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Members to vote on him today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not sure that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday there were further votes against this project, both from the Republicans and from the Democrats.
`Ganz obviously doesn't understand Washington', said the Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, his electors.
`Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are trying to ask the taxpayers for cash.'
The democratic MEP Brad Sherman, head of a group at the Congress, called 'the Kaukus of the Skeptician', represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three nobel prizemakers, have written us to tell us: We ask the Congress not to be pressured, and to consider carefully what way is going on,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, we again got the evidence in Europe that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial government of the Fortis Bank Group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The entry into force of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank announced BNP Paribas that it would refrain from buying her competitors who are in great difficulties since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis through the risky real estate credits in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'That's not a lost money, explained yesterday by Dutch Minister for Finance Wouter Bos.
In order to compensate, we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savings and households appreciate, now that insecure times are announcing. '
During this time, on the other side of the channel, the British government was just trying to understand another bank brought into trouble by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take all current loans at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that she would buy the branches and the customer accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to Northern Rock, which the British government must state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trumpet for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free himself with the charming smile from the narcistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensitivity, and a obvious talent probably have kept him away from a position of power that brings the really frightening monsters to the world.
But what a big permanent runner!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 on the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he liked and for which he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his act, certainly also more fragile, but likewise an apostle of freedom and the sponge of dramatical conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jews and a Hungarian mother.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream should come from its European roots.
Without excessive ego, extremely quality feature.
Because in him a whole country that was in love with the self-made man was reflected in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War, who studied acting art in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's studio in New York before he had success in the theatre, television, and soon also in the cinema.
Even this man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver, who became second in 1979 at Mans 24-hour race, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a show relationship with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also the unknown facets of this mysterious, reluctant, committed, and against the glamour of the show business oversensitive stars, whose puzzles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman moved the cinema lovers to dive this weekend, while on the dark screen of memories all his large roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with him.
Then the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) recalls, and the young man who resigns his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot sheet roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memorial (1990) is being awakened to his sensitive Lord Bridge, who is disturbed at his high age by a wedding that did not fulfill all their promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graciano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a handful of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean, was resumed after his death and correctly announced Newman in 1956.
This sympathic ganove in the superb The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar in 1973 for the best film.
As a bitter and revenge billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, he was.
He's still.
In his course, epochs are united.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox trainer of a ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen.
With a last role in 2003 as a pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
In contrast to several cinema legends who have withdrawn early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, with Hollywood, his assets, his punk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'Underplaying' when he judged his all too expressive performance.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, who only flew the rolls for a long time.
But he rarely played Sunnyboys as an external side: neurotikers, alcoholics, fieslings or desperate ones, with their perfect representation he reflected his abstract and his rebellion.
As director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true decent sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, signed a delicate female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of fine feeling and sadness.
During the flood of honors, which took place yesterday about Newman, his close friend and former armed companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared greatly: "His presence has improved my life and this country."
Genuine generosity and enjoyment were essential properties of the deceased actor.
Apart from its legendary career, a major defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, a opponent of Hollywood's abortion, is now going to do so.
We may have seen him often with the foot full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and we thought that this was quite tasteless, although we found it fun at the beginning.
However, the profits from his turnover fled into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Immer and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.'
And for us it was an honor to persecute the life of a so intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the closest and most widespread sense.
What has been produced in the accounting factory of surcharge &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal process begin against János' grant and its complicities.
In particular, the defendant is accused of participation in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent injuries and business fraud, and other offences - including document fraud.
According to the public prosecutor, the funds lucky from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often provided with false invoices.
State funds and grants from self-management - a total of HUF 65 million - are intended to be partly flown into the cabinets of the Fiatal Baloldal Organisation, partly in the private cases of individuals.
As the inquiry authorities announced, fictional invoices were submitted in the form of tenders, and the associations should not have complied with their obligations.
According to the accusation, most of the invoices should have been faked.
The invoice blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies are to be issued invoices was decided on that round trip north of the Plattensee to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices on consumers to be able to issue invoices based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-management of Budapest.
These invoices should have been manipulated by István Lados and his complicity, András
One of the goals of Lados' "Discovering Tour" was a beer site.
As two invoices issued by the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association are to be found in 2003, the gastronomy business is supposed to have preserved the ninety-country group.
Now, however, the head of the company indicates that such a large group would not at once have fitted into the local.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation Jobb Jövūért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can not accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests should have stopped according to invoice.
The imagination of the invoice counterfeiters was apparently no limits as it was about Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose accounting documents of the clients Jobb Jövęért and Hoppá did not appear at all, according to the prosecution authority.
As managing director Gyūzů Farkas told the hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that it was falsified documents when documents were submitted to him by the prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were wrongly placed on the stamp."
And further: Apart from form errors, the fact was also wrong that the operation was supposed to have housed one hundred people after they have a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to provide space for so many people.
Also on the invoice, the restaurant has been no longer in operation for a long time.
The excess fakers have also absurd to verify that the Budapest travel agency taken into sight only offers travel abroad, and thus they have indicated Hungary-river on the cash payment account, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
Moreover, as it was known in the course of the investigation, they also brought VAT on the invoices, although travel offices relating to a country outside the EU are free of added value.
In total, the amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation Jobb Jövūért, since the company accounted for only 25 percent of VAT, as well as the employees are issued exclusively machine bills, but the falsified documents were handwritten.
Another error that had been interrupted by the "requirement Armies" was that in a case they had indicated "transport of goods" as accomplished performance, although this was not offered by the company specialised in investment consulting, the prosecutor notified.
Further form errors - false invoice format, wrong stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be revealed as counterfeits.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Sports Camp Kunfehértó, whose managers regretted to have never issued the invoices.
Another "defect" is the falsifier at the hib Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was in resolution at the time (2001) when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to eat there - the mass administrator therefore indicated that the invoices were not issued.
Fake consciousness
The other group of invoice investors is persons who were quite aware that they would have to put fictional invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation of Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued invoices for the Foundation of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, at a height of about 4 million HUF.
According to the accusation, the Managing Director of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to the exhibition of the fictional invoices.
The Biogate Kft, which is currently in liquidation, is intended to have co-worked with surcharge and co.: In 2003, the GmbH intends to provide the Foundation Jobb Jövůért Alapítvány, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vorösfenyů Egyesület with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which relates to non-profit services.
However, there was just as little payment traffic, since the invoices were canceled immediately after their exhibition, which the persons concerned had forgotten to notice in their documents.
The third group of invoice investors shall include persons directly linked to the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postboat of the Ukrainian Managing Director of the Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company located in Budapest, but not found there.
This company should have issued several invoices about the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF from October to December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment kft from Kiskunhalas was intended to have served as buyers of these invoices since 14 September 2005.
Managing Director of this company was a Romanian to which Iván Kubatov also had to issue the company documents between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigations, Kubatov issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their counter value itself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. are supposed to have been founded by Romanian Maurers on Iván Kubatov's explicit wish.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the accused, was of lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: on request of his complicity, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned to prepare the company's foundation documents, he issued bills on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with grants, such as atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Cubatov intends to have issued 15 invoices in total of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations.
The prosecutor assumes that Cubatov could have collected 10% of the account and VAT each.
Kubatov should have even misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional invoices - in this case the invoices were contributed to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006 the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért issued their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500.000 forint each, but benefited from these amounts.
To hide this, they have presented to the TMA five fictional bills of the Works Team Kft.
In addition, these invoices were ensured in the Ministry of Education in the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsey.
In the negotiations, a number of defendants are now charged with a consent on the practice of fake accounting, as they were already presented before the prosecutor.
A sensation could be if the main apology accused János decides to be a comprehensive consent.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report extensively about everything, his consent is still out.
The question is, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have completed a pact with him with regard to the recovery of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the grant is willing to take account of the responsibility.
It is possible, however, that grant now plays the "failed person" after his attempt to alleviate the imprisonment and house arrest had hit deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused far greater damage with economic offences and have not compensated them are on a free foot, or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains denied.
The psychology of the overboy - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, the buyers tend to spend more and thus to overview the security bidder.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now been able to discover the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to give themselves in a competition, such as a auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play lotto, while the other participated in a gambling action - in both cases the active brain regions of the volunteers were examined by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain ring, was measured in losers of the auction, which plays an essential role in offering the opponent.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore said that price increase was explained by avoiding an overreaction of the Striatum.
In order to undermine their thesis, the economists in the research group have further studied the follow-up of money.
In this case, three groups should offer against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their operations.
In addition, another group was promised 15 dollars reward, in the case that they come out of the game as winners.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore merely that the emphasis on the one was on the win, while the other was on the loss.
As evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologians, however, the members of the "contrary to losing" group were ready to make higher interventions than those in the control or "winn" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
They have so far just reasoned the practices observed in auctions with the joy of gaining or avoiding risks.
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved thanks to the illustrative neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation parat" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor looking for?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed under the leading causes of death.
The number of infected persons is estimated to be hundreds of thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective concept for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellow insufficiency are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from one another.
Depending on the pathogens, hepatitis viruses spread to two different types: in hepatitis A and E, the digestive tract (e.g. by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body liquids (e.g. sperm, secret or speal).
Travelers are advised to vaccinate the virus A and B, in any case, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A show about two-third weeks after the consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by inconvenience, weakness, abdominal pain and breeding.
Afterwards the yellow addiction occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery may last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from the diseases caused by hepatitis B, much more severe, such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected in medication treatment is.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, as the ignorance destructions the liver cells in secretly - in many cases the first symptoms are shown after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular inspections, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more frequent: those undergoing blood transfusion before 1991, drug dependents, and tattooed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C diseases is estimated to be 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease is already proven in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the doctor in the first signs of unknown origin.
Right-time recognized, the disease is healable, the virus can be eradicated, which banns the risk of infection and prevents the emergence of cancer.
The 30th September is the World Day of Hepatitis, for the first time in 2004 of patient representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen the consciousness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, its origin and the significance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research results show that religious faith acts like a kind of "blessed" that should have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It has been investigated how much faith in God affects human sensation of pain, reports the British sheet "Telegraph".
During the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks each, while studying a painting of the mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to disable most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it was even possible to prove that Catholics could activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for pain regulating.
The investigation was the first to participate in a research project, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
During the trial, a funny device was connected to the left hand, which gave the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: one picture of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the believers would produce a kind of religious trance while choosing Vinci's image because it was hardly different from other paintings and felt soothing.
The trialers spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during this time, while they were to look at either the religious or the other paintings.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "in security" when they looked at the mother of God, as if they were "carried" and they had felt "rest and peace".
During viewing the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in sight.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, said that you could also produce similar effects with other, strongly active pictures in the atheists, you would just have to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find a picture that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality and do it in many cases," says Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question of what effect a Madonna image Leonardo or another similar painter would have on the pain regulating of the believers.
Would the high-quality virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're telling about you.
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with fug and right: it can be found in the pockets of people just as about her heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they are going, and what they are moving.
And so still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managers.
In the direction of skeptics plagued by Orwell's horrorvisions, he says that they would just overlook the essence of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main goal of Google is to collect even more personal data about the users and thus draw closer to the original goal of the company, which it wants to "organize all the information of this world".
Schmidt said that after ten years of changing work, Google was still only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked for the status Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished that Google would be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits to me?", but software programs are not yet able to know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which were searched, and the visited sites.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and to take back on it later, so that the results can be generated much more precisely and based on the same logic, the so-called "recommendements" that the system recommends tailored products and services due to previous preferences.
However, the users wonder what happens in the case of data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that acts fearfully, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire for the power that arises from rejection in many Internet users.
However, it is proven that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed to third parties in the case of the occasion, and there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user in these legal cases.
A parade example of this has recently been the action against pedophilia in Brazil, where Google provided information to the Brazilian government collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify pedophilia.
However, for personal rights concerned, users were still able to breathe up in May when Google, together with the Civil Rights Organization, successfully moved against the FBI in court: so Google can also be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request with no point of the Constitution in the future.
(In fact, the Federal Government has successfully produced 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the youth protection law adopted years ago, but it has been retained the list of individual users, or their web and search terms lists for two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who dismiss their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimsphere by using the Google services, scourge the company with the conservative embarrassment.
However, the American "Geek culture", which is present in many countries and enthusiastic in computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even if both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require its users to identify codes in contrast to Microsoft, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, continuously updated source code and program package seem far more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks are looking through the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet knife - a relationship which has been centralized in recent years, especially thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" concerns nothing but collaboration, speak, the users will deliberately leave tracks and use the available communication channels, and even if the sizes are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show itself publicly.
An average youth can simultaneously manage his profile on several Community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, can connect it through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually link it into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. Furthermore, they can run blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are geosted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples proves: When considering the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is released, because in his blog he only makes all too honest his angry about corporate management air - one is sure: the term "Privatsphere" has been completely re-interpreted now.
Whoever leads an online life is what he resigns from himself - for example, you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even to handle the Google Monopol, can be happy to do this - such as with Scroogle, a tool that, although accessing Google's search engine, will not deliberately leave any traces behind.
Not a few people intentionally do not register on Community pages so that they are not found, but also Google's online applications, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show their true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertisements of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of the advertising agencies, and the fasterly introduced services not only provide Microsoft but also other software developers head breakdowns.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counterpole: For example, the company's management has completely rejected a protest from the employees after the fees of the company's own kindergarten have been doubled, and the management also said that the multi-time care of the employees is too costly. However, all of this is quite gentle against the fact that Google even went into the knee in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement that all the regime-critical hits, or those who violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal scheme of the Group is that no new service will be applied in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could reverse somewhat strongly: while some think that Google's book and magazine scan/archiving project now assumes that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the system of "health", which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors already delivers the substance - e.g. "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in best orwell Manier a future in which a person will be frighteningly near thanks to Google's data.
Two youths help the double killer of Ózd in the removal of tracks
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police has now interrogated two youths who are suspected to have helped to remove the traces, the spokesman of the police commander Borsod informed on Tuesday.
The young people were ordained, and they are currently being accused of the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, it is two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened by a penalty of up to five years.
The suspicion of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was investigated on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of killing several people out of money greed.
In the course of the investigation, it has been shown that the 23-year-old had devoted a greater amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to compensate for his debts, so he attracted his believer to a ground in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the deed of long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the crime site.
Together with experts, the police are now examining the crime weapon and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers purchase for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw stock exchange offered for the hundred percent purchase of the stock packages of the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that the Poland had made, despite the fact that they had previously been excluded by the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw stock exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares is in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily newspaper "E15", Poland's offers include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the newspaper, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have been offerings so far.
Petr Koblic, Chief of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that from all the interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner, and he did not exclude that in the future this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of Prague stock exchange to 5-10 billion crowns.
According to shareholder agreements, 90% of shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent investment bank, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. by 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis on Tuesday, some leading European leaves already spoke of "two September 11".
The global financial disaster was due to the American President, for example, to "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to bring his own party to the draft law behind himself, which should bring some relief into the fearful situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the milliard-hearted investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "two September 11th".
Parts of the press in Madrid also ordered the sinsbock in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The American financial system threatens to collapse more and more, and it will suffer the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, it is now threatening the danger that Washington has no political means of crises management.
The world economy is in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
You can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva says "Days-Anzeiger".
Although some countries could still provide rescue packages to their banking institutions, saving banks with the money of taxpayers from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are or more banks are pleading, then no further financial sprays or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, the EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weakening monetary institutions, the Vienna standard recalls. Furthermore, the newspaper continues to be more realistic, the concerns that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers would have to take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not been seriously confronted with the crisis which is now fought like a tsunami over the old continents.
The "returners" would not have to "weddle" immediately with several hundred billion euros, but it would be advisable to hold in what case it would be reasonable to address the money of taxpayers to eliminate even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies for accident prevention if not imitating the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, those of the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented that inspired the Nissan engineers of Hummeln in the creation of new accidents of preventive systems.
In collaboration with the Tokyo University, Nissan built the biomimetical system controlled by authorobots of the type BR23C, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight each bee forms its own oval "Private Area", which is very similar to our own "shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology-PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The combined eye of the bee, which can see in every direction and in an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a 180-degree face area within 2 meters, calculates its distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately initiates the collisions avoiding process.
The obstacle is recorded in seconds, and the authorobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
This manoeuvre takes place purely instinctively, unlike systems before.
"If not, the authorobot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the authorobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innerest and most vulnerable part of the protective shield - a layer within the accidents currently considered inevitable.
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And that must be in the fraction of a second.
However, retirement, unlike the bees, cannot be up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, in the direction of the tyres.
While the bees here are infinitely open to avoid other bees, researchers were able to operate only the rotary movement, or acceleration and abbreviation.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy-efficient and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of the data, and less to the ability to store it.
This device must only process some inputs per second and respond to them accordingly.
It doesn't have to save it, or create an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of former manövers, so it's still using just a handful of KB Memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collisions prevention technology, which, according to Nissan's assessment, will be serial in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sinful child
Now, the written version of the 700-mrd dollar package of serious rescue package is available, which will be applied in several stages and aims at purchasing the poor credits of the banks.
In the first pass, half of the money will be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight, East Coast, the Congress Members, after multiday debates, went through a agreement on the 700 billion dollar package of heavy rescue, said Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the American House of Members, and said that the agreement should only be brought to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the program will show effect and it will be efficient, but it will have to do more. According to Pelosi, it was not about the salvation of Wall Street, but about the restoration of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, so Washington's time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (medium European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), but has not triggered a high flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Members first agreed on the draft law on the stabilization of the economy in 2008, then the Senate is on the row.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
The programme, however, deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration that the $700 billion should be spent once for purchasing fauler, with loans burdened securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of the half of the 700-million amount is to be issued, with 250 billion immediately available after the convention is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is intended to be used for the purchase of credit-loaded, bad securities, and the further USD 100 billion is to be decided by the President.
The programme is reviewed by a Commission of its own, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision on the convention.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgages charged securities, or other "toxic" credits.
As responsible persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying resources and pays the undertakings the likely damage due to them.
Henry Paulsen said that the law defines the necessary funds so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as immediate aid to the American financial system, whether for the large purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk triggered by the collapse of a larger monetary institution.
We take the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it was signed, says Paulson.
However, the bosses of the banks who are in difficulty and now depend on State aid can expect the government to shorten their completions called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas snake salopp.
A reduction in salaries will only exist in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry purchases in the context of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the deprived bank chief is deported to the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of lazy loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that managers are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions only refer to new agreements so that more people can participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that reductions are regulated by law on managers, the Democracy Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains shareholder rights in participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank gets better.
The draft law provides that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress over the next five years, how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
That is not what the American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect the money of taxpayers at all, says the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said that the measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

No more visa in the US from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances for the American-Hungarian Visa Agreement to enter into force around the 12 years, as the Foreign Minister explained in front of the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
Their view is that "all things now depend only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in overseas in time".
However, it also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The director of Hungarian diplomacy will take negotiations in Washington from now on.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will give her the "Midtlere Conservation Cross with Star" to the Republic of Hungary, and she also talks with the foreign policy consultants of the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the large American parties, have granted their support for the 700 billion dollar rescue package for banks on Sunday. However, there are also politicians who demand the withdrawal of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and Representative of the Government announced after days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement on the Banking Regulatory Package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the opening of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country from the economic crisis.
After recent surveys, Obama has been able to further expand its advantage thanks to the economic themes, while McCains Hoch, which has melted him the presentation of the Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention.
At a election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will quickly accept the law of $700 billion.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passages of consumer protection which it has supported.
"We have to act now, with responsibility (...) - your jobs, your savings, whole industrial sectors, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened" he said 35,000 spectators.
He has not missed calling McCain's economic visions as "obsolet".
In an interview given to ABC, McCain explained: "There will we all have hard to chew... but no time is certainly an alternative."
The Republican senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the completions for top managers - something that he had to do with.
Obama said that McCain would not have played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the spokesman of the Nancy Pelosi House informed that the House of Members will probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, only the voters became self-conscious within the camp - so commented "The mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-sided German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria over decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch break is at the same time a problem of Christian democratism, as well as for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU desaser did not come, but on Sunday something has ended, but it was quite exactly ten years ago: the unquestionable Hegemony of a State Party
For 10 years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell for the first time under the 50 percent brand since the fifty years.
This repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestags elections, so still in the many quoted Stoiber-era.
The consistent modernization operated by the CSU in the federal country has ultimately destroyed her own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but at the pace, they were considerably estimated. However, without effect, secularization, education results, the accession of East and North German to the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain on the loyalty of the CSU elections.
Modernisation is always taking place with options increase, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the electors within the camp became more critical and more selfish.
It is noteworthy that in recent weeks the classical civilian groups expressed the largest distance to the CSU: free professions, commercial citizenship and electors with abitur, such as university degrees.
Here the support of the CSU dropped to even below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in her "Who with whom? Heads of Party in Coalition's Questions" about the chaotic domestic situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the involvement of SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talk in all directions, while the Greens do not want to decide in relation to a coalition yet.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about coalition; in the debates on public-legal television, the leaders of the party were hardly able to look into their cards.
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very well possible - in some federal countries and in the social partners, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP Chief as a Vice Chancellor, opened Faymann.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the Schüssel-Molterer-Kurs.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
However, Molterer has responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said when Faymann tried to intervene in the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition or in coalition is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed internally.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are willing to take government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken through
Today the European Summit has begun on equal opportunities in Paris, which is now addressed by the President-in-Office of the European Council of France.
In its speech addressed to the plenary session, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEPs of the European People's Party, pointed out in particular to the education segregation, since it is one of the most serious violations of law that affects Roma children, and this is also the greatest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civilian organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, as the press office of the EP Members of Fidesz notes, pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job searching, Roma would be oppressed from the labour market mainly because of their low level of education.
"The predominant majority of Roma youths have no media education, and thanks to poor basic education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree."
Járóka also emphasized that education is a fundamental human right which is a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
According to the Members, it is important that these relationships become aware of as wide as possible, i.e. Roma and non-Roma.
As soon as a Roma student starts school, its chances to become a productive member of the labour market are increasing, and by means of income and turnover taxes, they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated education needs to be stopped" says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member stated, a common, objective and negotiating action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the deregulation process in the education sector, which is essential for the proper compliance of existing and planned anti-discrimination directors.
"We have to break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic possibilities to contribute to the future of Europe as fully-authorized citizens," Járóka demanded.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the preparation of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national level in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the decouple of elections, no heads are still rolling, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates have been postponed.
Vice-President Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace takes.
About the fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17% loss of voice is decided on the last October week on the extraordinary day of the party.
But the lot of sheltered duo has already seen that it does not want to stick on their seats.
They therefore want to reassure the angry group and the party base, which demanded a day after the "bayerian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career highlight - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
The CSU was 46 years old "all-in-regulators" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the defining force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party internal restructurings, the potential successor Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Foreign Minister Horst Seehofer is also involved in the exploration team, which leads with the liberal FDP, or the legally directed "free electors" broadcasting talks about a possible Munich coalition.
One irony of fate is that with the list "Free Electors" that Gabriele Pauli enters into the law, whose anti-styre appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo first used to serve the determined politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the threads out of the background, will have an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called the "bitterest day of his political career" on September 28th.
On Monday Huber made some poisonous comments towards CDU - he believed that the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed much to success at national level in 2005, should not be put back to the legs with a joint force act, Merkel cannot again become Chancellor after the Federal Day elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a hole from her disappointment about the Fiasko, believes that the terrain loss of the CSU will not have a negative effect on the large coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of social democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition has succeeded in the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers think that this is the prosperity and stability in the country guided by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects violations of law in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million resident state has come out for decades without opposition. Nevertheless, the counterparty gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before the previous elections seriously hoped that Lukaschenko, who renewed his presidential mandate in the unfair elections and, thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, for the fourth time that some Members of Parliament's opposition would be "allowed".
That is why the ODS even took a distance from the Boykottes planned before.
Ukraine is increasingly dependent on the rising prices of natural gas imports from Russia. For the reduction of price increases, the country has even accepted loans, and the land has also approved the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country, to the Russians. In the context of the expectations of opposition, the hope that Ukraine wanted to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukaschenko and other high-level politicians have entered the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
For a temporary relaxation, the evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than the deficiencies - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticized the campaign on Monday - that is, the opposition cell is not supposed to occur in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Nevertheless, the opposition is able to recognize a improvement in the political system: Political prisoners were set freely, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the absent Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abchasien, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on paper, has regarded the two areas as independent for a month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our sheet.
According to the 2006 presidential elections' opposition candidates, a continuation is desirable, although "mighty people have been afraid to let only one oppositional into Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for an economic reform to voters.
"We have to fight with many problems here - the opposing newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities will put us in the way of distribution stones, but yet I see that more and more people support the change, even the older" said Milinkewitsch in presentation that not even the most supported layer of the pensioners agrees with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only earnings are the production of social security.
"Thanks to the debt of the country and to the increase in trade deficit, it is just a question of time until the "social security" invoked to the silence of a cemetery begins," says Milinkewitsch.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Community Mission Independent States, the news agency Ria Novosti stated: "The people believe the actions, and not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore evidence of the maturity of Belarusian electors.
Brunetta: "From now on, before the work is frozen"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are turnable doors for the entrance and exits of officials.
From now on, the measure will enter into force against those clauses that are only stamped off and then go to coffee drinks during the working time.
The new 'Anti-Faulpelz-Gesetz' was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">"Drawable doors are a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," Brunetta underlines again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of twisting doors is also of great symbolic value."
There was no opposition from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, therefore, there is no breakfast now during the working time; end with coffee or Croissant.
Brunettas advises on this with a smile: "A good cappuccino works miracles at 7 a.m.".
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Publica Amministrazione)
by Rome, the Minister announced that "in three months the absences of officials have reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 people a year are more present at work".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"The wage dynamics - the Minister said - have been twice as large as the private sector and far above the inflation rate in the last 8-10 years."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined together to counteract the Brunetta Decree in the context of the codacons supported call.
"While the Minister for Public Service profiles itself with figures about lower reductions in work - according to the Consumer Centre - the people grow uninterrupted by the 'active fauls'.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have gathered together to explain the conflicting standards of the Decree the war."
In particular, before the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) for additional financial compensation for work-related diseases, the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker is also being challenged, during which control visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's innovations.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents is crucial"
Every day there are 2500 work accidents in Italy, three people die and 27 lively disabled.
For the year 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto national contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents of work were in about 1200.
These figures prove to be the seriousness of a phenomenon, which causes almost twice as many deaths as is caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will take the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents to address the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the crucial issue of prevention at work.", the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirms in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to preventing jobs, protecting the injured workers, supporting the victims' families, and awareness of public opinion".
"A embarrassed "Basta" has come to this; understandable for tragedies that, measured by their size, cause some spine in the media and public participation. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is, in any case, a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
A particular significance is given to the numerous initiatives for more direct awareness in school frames by the young people who feed the working world.
It is our duty to focus the attention on this phenomenon and not to distract from his social seriousness.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "as the phenomenon of the work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all the institutions to work on decisive rules aiming to put an end to the problem".
"The data of the work accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is too high," stresses President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy at the end."
"How do you think that you are doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against it by various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to inform workers who are already starting at school".
"A further effort is needed - so he adds - as regards communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility of employers' sides is demanded for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli also spoke of "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the accident victims of the work," and proclaimed "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a warranty on insurance, so that the fate of the victim of a worker is not dependent on voluntary or random donations decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player under accusation: danger of hearing damage
Sound music over a longer period of time with portable musical devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This will report to the European Commission, which in a report, which has been distributed in Brussels today, quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"The report, according to a note, makes it clear that 5-10% of those who hear loud music with portable musical appliances for at least five years a week longer than an hour a day will risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people who usually put portable musical devices and mobile phones on a high volume, are intimately damaging their listening without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific findings – so it's called by the Eu – show a clear risk that pushes too fast action.
What really matters is to sensitize consumers and make this information a common one.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the already existing control systems so that they are completely effective and keep step with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical appliances among young people.
"The scientists - this concludes the EU communication - confirm that one is too worried and that the European Commission, together with the other members of the European Union and the affected, will now examine the necessary measures to protect children and young people better from the noise that comes from portable musical devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard, which limits the level of noise from portable musical devices to 100 dB, and concerns about the damages that might come from too large noise loads.
You can limit these damages very much, in which you take solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the sound.
In their report, the Scientific Committee of the European Communities points out that if users of portable musical appliances hear only five hours a week loud (lauter than 89 decibels) music, so that the legal limits are already exceeded, which apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross this border risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
So this was 5-10% of the users of such devices whose number can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Roma, Alemanno gives the start of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, it's supposed to be over in March, in June the balance will be drawn.
This is the expiry defined by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". The Commission has taken place this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermals.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project will be completed, the City and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Supreme Mayor of Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," says Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the City and the City Council.
There is no re-distribution of powers, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be terminated and the Commission will re-establish as such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June - the Supreme Mayor announced - we will introduce the strategic plan in which we will take advantage of the work done by the Commission.
Anyone questioning the competence of the Commission, since it lacks liability, responds to Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will perform and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is dealing with the daily problems and emergencys that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The chief mayor of Rome pays much value to clarify the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to reflect. It will focus on the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetically nor static to enable our city a high quality jump, which it really needs, and thus to do a common step towards the future".
A future, according to the Supreme Mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself in the current local borders, but will look much further," not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American President?
A well-known American politician who is much about being regarded as independent wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-american president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US's economy by his decisions and kept relations with the opposed Islam (and still does this as a private man today)".
The attacks against Obama are becoming increasingly stronger, just now where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a web page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very frequent: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!".
These attacks, however, have not much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; all say that Obama will win with a great advantage.
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in her editorial: only in the election cabin we will probably know who the true American patriot will give his voice.
Here is a mentality of the United States, which has been concealed until the last time.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our crew, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will move from America.
Something you never heard before – only now where the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What error has Bush committed during his term of office? 89% replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a step in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its traces with journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the shortenings, and many accuse the Internet, the "mörder" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control on the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really worry about the information concerning the competent persons because of the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are due to the reductions in the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that must be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, does not significantly shrink.
A clear but complicated pessimism is fulfilling the American journalist today.
Six of the ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalistism is on the wrong way at national level.
In the local field, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for the journalists to imagine in what direction the web is going on.
The main publishing groups are going to the Internet, which is considered by many as the "ciller" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" which the journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to want to join the new technology in the hope "she brings something good for journalistism".
Today, the biggest risk exists in American journalism between the head editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national editors are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% are locally.
Some think it has to do with the "Security in Work".
The operators who fear to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists have 30%.
The topic of the "safe work" in the team (our "redacters", Anm. d. Red.) is always a topic in the US.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as it are the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, employers like it offer them popular and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The chief editors often get very high wages, but the editor can sometimes get only 10000 euros per month, including pensions and insurance funds.
As far as the holiday is concerned, the matter is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they admit themselves, will often be "ill" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: REPORT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROSSAFERRATA
The President of the second criminal chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate broker, which had been asked to be transferred to Rome from Grottaferrata.
It is determined against Coppola in the context of the investigation of the counter-compliance in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (contrary to which the prosecutor had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence of accusation to him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Members voted against the 700 billion dollar par package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the previous edition of New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the course of the course of the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast Seale, which always favored the state institutions and the business community, and the neoconservative, which is opposed to the "in Washington" and the financial world, and wins electorate in the south and center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise by the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is announced or even already present: not only in the USA, even in the west, and perhaps beyond them will be affected by them.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-time feared events which finally take shape and light under these new conditions.
The first of this phenomenon is the new discovery, the unheard renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a degradation of banking and financial institutions, which have close links to abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of private household assets that live in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments, namely how to behave against the families concerned, which are also a huge electoral mass.
So the crisis appears globally economically, politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been so disadvantaged and lost its right of speech: the clear evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division of national and international conflicts, cannot be found in a common way.
Therefore, all are now expecting the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, for example, distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more serious, only the US are in the economic situation to save themselves without any other help.
In addition to the resources, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two non-experienced conditions – in certain circumstances – to which, otherwise, no international organisation or market will be able to withdraw in a similar way.
That new emphasis, which is placed on the state-national element, is, by the way, perfectly in line with the ever-increasing importance that is recently linked in the economy with a very closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is just now when we were so convinced that we have long entered into a networked realm, in a realm of ever differentiated technologies, the immaterial that we have to find at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although they can certainly all be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are still connected to an outer part of the earth – a territory.
That is why the person who has such a territory is beneficial to another who lives in an eradless, waterless or oil-free area.
I am now coming to the second novelty, however, which requires a short intake.
Whoever territory, whoever government, who says politics, also says Leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge about the need for respected Leaderships, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is a wave of disarmament about the existing leaderships, e.g. those of the economy, which have evolved as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, insufficiency, an image of ineffectiveness, a feeling of the distance, which is all focused on a whole class of managers of Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large parts of the population is the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already its idea world, its Way of Life, its culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is the majority as ever more foreign and survivor.
The demand for Leadership thus nourishes underground a twinned but powerful movement of the demolition of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the immediate revolt of the collective state of mind in recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, towards the rebellion of the U.S. Members against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the rights in Italy).
One gains the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems, and therefore less representative value regarding what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and is further strengthened by the financial crisis and driven up to overdimension.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes far open is surely not.
The super sticker that lets go up on walls
The forces of gravity to defeat thanks to a adhesive and to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, of which one of them seems to have reached almost the goal.
With an adhesive adhesive on a surface of only 2.5 sqcm, the researchers have managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanor tubes.
"The principle of the adhesive can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered to a pile of Spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the Geckos, which are covered by microscopic hardships that give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with different materials such as Glass Teflon and Schleifpapier have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holdability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "freely remove from the wall," says Liming Dai, researcher at the Department of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
AN MAUERN ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as a premature adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Something like Spiderman to get on walls? Perhaps already, but the researchers think more of a less fascinating advantage, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanor tubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application may fall into the area of space.
So for the moment, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF THE FORSCHING – also the University of Berkeley, California, devotes itself to a new adhesive type.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, the California scientists present an adhesive from micro fibers that clean themselves like hair by moving on a surface from dust and thus always maintain perfect liability.
Medicines: Never take with fruit juice
Caution against grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These beverages, which are consumed by their refreshing quality and vitamin riches for example in summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken with certain vital medicines, as they can affect the intake of them by the body in an extreme way.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaging and fresh fruit juices in connection with medication. In the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he repeatedly made alarms: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the ability to take certain vital medications so that these are practically eliminated and the health of patients is threatened.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiolytic medicines, anxiolytic and neurologic agents to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS IN FAHR – The same agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago about the dangers of this mix and stressed that what is drunk in connection with medicines such as diazepan or metadon.
It's NOT GRAPFRUIT – according to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances cheated by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, Michele Carruba, Director of the Università Statale di Milano, appealed: "Some results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still unclearities, not to have a phenomenon or physician to ask," stressed the expert of the Ansa Agency.
Economic nobel price goes to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel price is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the economic and foreign policy of Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the enron collapse, Krugman claimed in a leading article of the New York Times that this second event was more crucial to the history of the US than the attacks.
A prediction, which was given little polemics as an answer and presented to the economy many years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked about how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public field of view," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economy of great value", but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style, which is especially directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software as a free substitute for Microsofts Office wins an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both under freelance and public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the audience with some new features: in addition to a revised and now economically designed start menu, a basis for secure compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, which is the latest standard ISO version.
Attention was also made to compatibility with Microsofts Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those allowing to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which e.g. facilitates sending via email. Also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time keeping the original look of the page.
So you can also generate "hybride" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most enhanced elements of the applications: tables can now be processed several times by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a fragment to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just trying to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the definitive result is to be published in the next few weeks.
The Italian version is available on the link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
The program for Windows and Mac OS is also available for the operating system Linux.
On request you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, the freedom of charge may be a incentive for the dissemination of the programme into private households, so it is also in the field of business where OpenOffice could succeed in the great gun: in the end, several public administration and schools have already passed over to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training offer, which means optimum help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text generation program; Calc, the table program that aims to diminish Excel; Impress, to create presentations like Powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of known access; and last Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already achieved.
Cool also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens a new Dopingfall mi frame of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athletes Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is a third-classified and winner of the Trikot of the best climber.
The message published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who has been tested positively on Cera, the third generation Epo. Previously, the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher met.
The analysis from the blood samples of coal belongs to those performed by the laboratories of Lausanna and Chatenay-Malabry in recent weeks.
If the counter samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive Epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, also informed the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans to the podium and also claimed the tricot of the best climber for himself.
THEMA INSTRUCTION: THE NEW YORK TIMES FREE: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the only country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only included with countersight.
Is this a nation of racists from the Belpaese? The New York Times asks this in a long article dedicated to the whole theme of racism in Italy and the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after clapping a package of cookies.
The case indicates what the Times calls "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and working opportunities" exist, and still "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by Lega against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underlines the Pope and the president: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope to cooperate between Church and State at a meeting on the Quirinal to combat racism."
Students victims of the up to 900-Euro per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students does not know any crises.
According to the last study by Sunia, the tenant work, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very serious trains, so many students lose their right to study, since their families are not able to support them at this level," said Sunia, Laura Mariani, responsible, "in these cities the great demand of the students leads to a deformation of the market, which also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, without rental price limits, unauthorized under rentals.
For the Sunia there is the need for exceptional measures which lead to lower rental prices by revision of taxation.
In view of the investigation, it is found that in Milan a sleeping area in the Brianza district is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the district of Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the district of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence a sleeping area costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the quarters around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the quarters are around the university at about 600 Euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
Just a little deeper are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Eastern and Cinecittà.
Only those in foreign districts can save money: 300 Euros for a bed and 450 Euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quartets.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a bed, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vonero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping area costs 250-350 euros, one single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to foreign students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent of 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historical cinemas are closed due to the beneficiary multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the great multi-sale complex in the periphery, in the long term means death for the indoor cinema in the center. A process that appears not only inevitable and irreversible, but also the trains of a cultural crime.
Most of the historical locations are full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with which one put down a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which brought him in 20 years ago the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes. It's the history of a suburb cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well lost cinema world.
The figures that the Anec, the central commercial association, provides, speak a clear language: over the last five years, the huge amount of 316 traditional cinemas have to be closed; these cinemas mostly paid the cinemas in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main guilty are the multiplexkinos, because it is just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy has made the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and the Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has evolved in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but in the first place the receipt of the already existing, because a hall in the city is closed, not all his tribal customers are willing to visit a multiplexcino in the periphery instead of the old.
And here is still the lack of food for the founding of the commercial association out of eight: the debt burden recorded by the State is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame of the ethical and moral view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be necessary."
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to fears about the old cinemas, has decided to protect them by an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy that aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The proposed measures also include tax advantages for the cinema drivers and benefits for the public regarding transport: it will be allowed to drive to the areas of the centre and park on cheaper parking fees.
"It is a delightful initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also create new concepts.
Of course, however, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to align something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that caused me to build the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had played with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I live in Rome; when I pass over at Rialto or at the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to avoid seeing the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Piromalli Mafia Group.
The accusations of the Lawyers of the Antimafia Authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his alternate Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested in Mafia shops this morning, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the clan and the public administration, as well as its nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clans, had already been sentenced to a compensation amount of 10 million euros because of being involved in criminal associations of the Mafia.
"Every kind of moral and legal norm disrespects," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advice activities."
"So the Mafia Group had been made possible – so the judges – to enter the Council's houses officially and to decide the public administration's policies."
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not ignore that in his region it is "all other than an exception to encounter connections between local administrations and organised crimes." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white west."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police of Clan Piromalli, were defeated.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – the local politicians of their municipal offices had been demolished.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected the head of the middle-right coalition after the election of May 2006.
He screamed Skandal as the prefecture ordered the resolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in the Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of finding everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with the warranty of this morning, declare that the Piromalli clan even dared to request a change in the A3 project.
The willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli, has been demonstrated in the case of Dal Torrione's investigations, making the public administration's actions identical to the interests of this clans."
When the energy springs out of the waves, suddenly the greats run up
It is a non-destructive source of money, which covers over 70% of the planet's surface, and only now this seems to understand the great energy companies in the world.
Waves, flows and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now looking for all, and also looking for occupied, such as giants like chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies have not randomly intensified significantly since the first oil crisis.
As the price of oil by 1980, the idea of marine energy was lost, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy demand could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to the double of the current energy produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides were coming.
Gigant in the attack.
The first company, which is now based on marine energy, is Enersis, who signed a contract for the establishment of a power plant in the north of Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry who are putting on marine energy production.
"Chevron examines these technologies" – the speaker of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal – and considers the possibility to cooperate with us."
This concerns the procurement of an authorisation from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a not too underestimating sign, e.g. if one considers that oil continues to be promoted by the US, and President Bush has recently launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the company Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which invests in the new industry, are not known as the details, so observers speak of an increasing interest.
Improveable technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in the breach, not least because the last doubts of environmental protectors have not yet been clarified.
To date, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimension and do not seem to cause serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy in a large scale, technologies are required with a far greater impact on the environment.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected Bojen.
The shaft of the waves, which moves the bows up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via colves and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The current is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
Until now there are four plans of this type, which are only waiting for state approval, and some of the energy gained could also serve for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a warehouse and a park latz with the help of underseas turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines that feed the generator through the resulting rotary movement.
According to Verdant, a long snake of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
A particular interest, according to the Institute for Electriculture Research, is immediately worthy of the potential in the tides.
Even though it is an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind flows, sun radiation and waves, and therefore a more reliable power source.
Especially the tide energy is what states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states have caused to invest 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
