A total of 174 harvesters were tested positively on the Corona-infectors Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the Landratamt Dingolfing-Landau reported on Saturday evening.

Infected by uninfected employees were separated on the courtyard, the terrain is now surrounded by an absperrzaun.
Greens and SPD were responsible for the government.
The two opposition groups urged Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect the control of the accommodations of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly revenge if such local infectious events have to be intervened and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, parliamentary leader of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already demanded a special control program for farms with harvesters," said Environmental Expert Florian von Brunn.
"Everything of the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the housing conditions must be carefully controlled from our viewpoint.
This obviously has not happened."
The outbreak was "with anxiety."

Report: Seehofer is pressing for longer storage of data
The stock data storage is currently suspended.
However, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs, Horst Seehofer, after a media report, calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) demands an extension of stock data storage after a media report - instead of the foreseeable 10 weeks a half year.
As the "Image on Sunday" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a quick change in law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He thinks it's useful to "have already made urgently necessary adjustments in the law," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently, the storage of stock data has been suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected to do so.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments beforehand so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesperson of the Ministry of Justice said the newspaper that it could only be reasonable to examine whether it would require legal adjustments if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already spoken for a stock storage in June.

Söder says after mass infection to the Corona-Lage
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has announced a Testofsive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be seen live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has abolished authorities and politics.
At the large farm for vegetables, almost 500 farmers from several countries are currently working, over a third has been infected with the corona organism.
The farm is now under quarantine and is locked with a building cow.
No one can leave the terrain, supply food.
The well-favoured 3300 inhabitants of the municipality now offer free Corona tests.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Landrats Office has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Knowledge" means the consent of the suspicious burner of Nantes
"My client has shown himself cooperatively," said the lawyer Quentin Chabert der Zeitung.
The defendant added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "pleaded by conscientious bites and brought very much from the extent of destruction".
In the case of a sentence, the man, according to the prosecutor, threatens ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Sankt-Peter-und-Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire last week in the night on Saturday.
The fire was broken out in the church at three far away places in the church.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of fire foundation.
The now imprisoned suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion in the church, he quickly entered the viewpoint of the investigators.
Discuss about abolition of the 50+1 rules
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel recommended to think about the abolition of the 50+1 rules.
"The German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said Grindel the "Image on Sunday".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not about whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations who want to break into this Phalanx."
He doubts, however, whether there is a willingness in the German football League to allow majority participations banned by the 50+1 rules in the Federal League.
"It remains a legal risk to move investment in a European single market around the Federalliga economic location," said Grindel.
The former DFB CEO sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Federal League only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even a equal distribution of TV money will not achieve a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern turns out 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 associations have an average household of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"There have been people who noticed this error and went through to the press instead of addressing it," said Grindel about the adoption of a expensive clock that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has been a lot of work for me."
The gift worth about 11,000 euros he had received from an Ukrainian functionary.
"I have committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences out of it," said Grindel.
"With the ominous watch gift, I have been completely transparent and unhappy.
Many of them knew about it in the DFB."
He never made "a hole from the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, in any case, this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Argentina refuses to offer the creditors
The new claims could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires informed on Saturday.
"This would not only be unresponsible, but also injustice," said an opinion.
"While 50 percent of children live in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer durable in the current conditions.
For this reason, Argentina calls on his private creditors to abandon some of its demands of around 66 billion US dollars (about EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is threatening the state site again.
It would be the ninth failure of payment in Argentine history.
Lastly, creditors had requested higher interest on State bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.

Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was last over 50 percent.
Experts expect to decrease the economic power by about 10 percent for the year.
At the end of May, Argentina had not balanced interest requirements of 503 million US dollars and had thus fallen into a limited payment failure.
Vocational arrival - not yet private
"It runs super good" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after their first days in the notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will join the succession of Lutz fields in the Eggenfelden Notariat site.
Six weeks later, early July, the professor took up the work, the normal day business has long been running on full tours.
"However, I still have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottal advertiser and laughs.
Of course, the short precursor period has not reached the complete shift of the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the borne Dingolfinger.
Currently she is looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband, who is a judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg.
At least, her husband has been able to apply for a short-term parental period in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to pend from Regensburg every day, she also has an opportunity to stay with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighboring country, the city of Eggenfelden is of course a long term for her.
When visiting locally with her family in the past months, she then noticed: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
The more she was pleased that she had made the race in the selection process around the free place.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional development, her homeland of Niederbayern plays a central role: After the Jura study in Passau, she completed her referendum time and the second state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notarassessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg, she also "in addition" trained the promotion in labour law in 2012 as a notarin in Rotthalmünster in Passau.
In 2016, she went to the parental age, and finally followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representative services in various notariats.
When the position had been issued in Eggenfelden because of the close retirement of Lutz fields, it had seen the right time for full professional retirement, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representative at the emergency office, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and has liked a praise for the team of the firm parat: "It's going to be super good!"
The fact that she can rely here on played processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private food point.
In matters of kindergarten-- respective crawlers, she has already contacted a local facility.
And if everything works like desired, she hopes to follow her hobby here too soon - and to meet the most beautiful yoggling tracks of the Red Valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"On the basis of the distance control, which is compelling, we are planning according to current status with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer, "day mirror".
Usually, the arena in the district city at Bundesliga games catches a little more than 8,000 spectators.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, the BVB per party lost about four million euros.
The Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization, hopes that in addition to the normal sites of view, some of the around 4000 places can be opened in the hospitality area: "It is of course a blow into the account when these revenues are completely broken down".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, all of them are currently "advisable to take a stable side long for the first time".
"If many companies are not good and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited," said Cramer.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chief praised the BVB professionals for their salary partition, which is supposed to contribute to the overcome of the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their loss of salary has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in Merchandising to short work".
Winzig wonders: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
Little harder than a packer butter, just one time three dining spoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 springs, which are cared for every year at the Grazer Children's Hospital.
One quarter of them weighs less than 1,500 grams, a few - such as Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early born that neither lungs nor intestinal nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an EKG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothing and specially designed mini-windles for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be at voice - "and like," Berndt URLesberger smiles.
"Of course, they don't shout as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes the stage

Afterwards, the students were able to exchange themselves with the actress and director Winfried Tobias over the piece and the performance.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona site was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar welcomed the enrichment of teaching.
Even though all the stakeholders agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional receipts, the theatre also sees the potential for contacting the schools.
"If we further improve the technical framework, this could become an interesting addition to the game operation," said director Winfried Tobias.

Kalbitz radius from AfD confirms - FDP speaks of "Fyeblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "few sheet" from the FDP and does not change anything in the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the legal excerpts in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the Eisberg of the radicals in the AfD," said the FDP intellectual politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday, after several hours of negotiations, the AfD Bundesscheidsgericht had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD really was about to remove legal extremists consistently from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his followers would have been long excluded," said Strasser.
"For this, however, there is no political will in the AfD because legal extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, doesn't say anything and does not change anything," he said "World on Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes, how many French supporters still have a legal extreem in the middle of the AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will land again under five percent at elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesman's officially dissolved "flights" around the Thüringer AfD-Land and Group Chairman Björn Hücke; the Constitutional Protection strikes the Strönung as a "proofed right-extremist effort".
In May, the AfD board had thrown Kalbitz from the party.
As a reason, Kalbitz did not specify a previous membership at his party entry in the now prohibited legal excerpts "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
The President of the Left Fraction at the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Bundesscheidsgericht did not change anything in the character of the AfD: "The Wolf has only eaten Kreide.
The AfD remains a legal extreme party, whether with or without calbitz.
This decision neither weakens the Federal Party nor the right wings.
"The manoeuvre of the Müthen-Truppe is visible.
One wants to escape further observation by the Constitutional Protection and try to get through under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not go on the spirits she called.
There's no change in a drainage," commented Brandenburger SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the group held to their right leader until today."
The legal dispute about the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
This announced on Saturday that he would now act against the decision of the Federal Judgment of Justice.
North Sea windparks deliver well 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year 11,51 Terawatt Hours of electricity, the wind power plants on the German North Sea sprinkled into the network.
These are about 21 percent more than the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet informed in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transfer of the North Sea stream to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The winding plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the network area of Tennet, have fed in further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) electricity.
Overall, the wind flow from the North and Baltic Sea comes at 13.73 TWh, compared to well 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest on sea thus represents almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, some four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher production capacities
The rising contribution of offshore wind energy results in addition to wind conditions from higher production capacity, as new wind parks have been connected to the network over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running with full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient, according to Tennet, at 7.1 gigawatt.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatt in the German North Sea until 2030.
"To date, we invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections in Germany and the Netherlands," said Tennet business leader Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms can not utilize their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
This year's recording day is January 2, when the North Sea Wind Parks produced more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration at 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold sprinkled the usual framework after the Corona break.

In the north of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was engaged.
Freital: Windberg festival due to Corona
The Windberg festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have indeed not made this decision easy and, in the consciousness of how difficult it is for the parties to be economically, hoped until the last minute," said Oberbürgermeister Uwe Rumberg (partless).
"But finally we are responsible here as an organizer for the health of many thousands of people."
For if tens of thousands were flown to the fixed ground and to the fixed tent, minimum distances, hygiene rules and contact follow-up could not have been observed in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that a folk festival wouldn't have left much.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase unproportionately by a multiplicity.
Rumberg was thirsty to next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence with the winter mountain festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.

More flights in worms
Wormser Hochschule continues to ventilate: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" establishes a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS was now signed in Worms.
The contract was first completed for three years and started in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to enable the beginning of the study not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, both in the university and in the DFS's Aviation Security Academy capacity are equally utilised.
The DFS will advise the university in the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been at the University of Worms in the Air Traffic Management course as part of their training for air traffic management.
This year, nine students already started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the performances of students are excellent.
The combination of study and lottery training contributes significantly to increasing the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy for us.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal order in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS in signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation's professorship is a future-proof investment that will transmit a broad, technically comprehensive knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue to cooperate with the university and simultaneously undermine our attractiveness as employers."
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The foundation professorship is an important bridge between science and economy.
With her we want to join the existing cooperation with the DFS German Aviation As a practice partner for the dual Bachelor study process Air Traffic Management."
The confidence of German Aviation Assistance is for Worm's University motivation and commitment to further strengthening its teaching and research competence in the future areas of aviation.
In the use of the aviation locks of tomorrow, the university could set very special highlights and innovative focuses for its students with the first foundation professor for a dual study course.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Training and Culture, stressed: "With its focus on air transport, the University of Worms has an all-defined feature in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue scrubber lands on the A 45
About 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully locked in the direction of Aschaffenburg on Saturday afternoon, as after a traffic accident the rescue scrubber was in use.
A 76-year-old ride with a Ford at 12.40 p.m. in the Alzenau exit in the curve straight forward and landed at the Guideplanke.

Healing wants to check other sectors after meat industry
The Corona crisis again revealed the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Legislative damages are shortly ahead.
But are they right - and will it stay?
Federal Minister for Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors according to the strict regulations currently planned against misfortunes in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry and then take appropriate measures for each industry, if necessary," said Heil der Deutschen Presseagentur in Berlin.
Germany's employers have already warned against restricting working contracts in general.
After the massive outbreak of Corona at the meat giant tonnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal cabinet wants to decide a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
Large slaughters should not be allowed to use foreign personnel in slaughter, destruction and meat processing.
To this end, the use of work contracts and loan workers is to be prohibited.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said: "Finger away from a general restriction of contracts and occupational transfers, if you do not want to disprove the economy completely".
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for large areas of the crafts, the construction industry and the construction of plants for the customer's value added.
"The mistakes of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Healing assured: "My goal is not to prohibit working contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are useful.
"If an industrial company is ordering a craftsman to build a security facility, this is a very normal contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and loan work alone in its industry to be unconstitutional.
It should not be explainable why in the event of the portion and packaging of cheese other work law should be applied than in the case of Wurst, it is said in an opinion on the law project, as the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Samstag) reports.
For a ban, the consumer price would therefore rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Many East European workers from working contract companies worked in the industry after the results of an examination of NRW labour protection management partly 16 hours a day.
Often they had no break.
wage was reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heal said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
But through "tricky constructions" they had been transformed.
"Now needs to be cleaned up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "In the labour protection law, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures not only concerning the meat industry - for example, higher levels of labour protection or clear criteria for Community accommodation."
The draft tabled by the Commission covers amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat sector and the law on protection of workers.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like to make more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal protection, everything possible, for example also animal transports," said Nonnemaker on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg currently".
But more controls also require more staff.

She was taken to the Clinicum Kassel.
With heat image cameras, the fire gun searched for possible riders.
The woman, according to the police on the Bundesstraße 83, was on the way to her place of residence Hümme, when her car came from the roadway from unclear cause to date and crossed itself several times.

Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming gate of Cristiano Ronaldo, Record Champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total 36. Scudetto of the club story with a 2:0 (1:0) in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa on Sunday evening.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before the mid-term.
With 83 points, Turin, who had not arrived without Sami Khedira's last-long-breaked ex-national player, is no longer drowning two play days before the end of the season of series A.
The Interland Table Two is seven points behind.
In spite of optical superiority, Juventus was harmless in the first half, then Ronaldo met after a release variant with the last action.
An addition of Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old directly from the criminal area border with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved on 2:0, after his shooting, Federico Bernardeschi (67.) demolished.
This guaranteed the glossy but decisive success.
The foulelf meter shot to the Latte in the 89th minute should have only been properly saw Ronaldo himself with a view to the Torjager valuation.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically on ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," explained Trainer Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual exhaustion of his players was great, the Juve Coach said.
Because of the defeat, the Turinians could not have made the championship perfect yet.
In the end, Juve had to be due to the weakness of the competitors in particular to the calm precedence at the table point.
For in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only succeeded five victories.
Whether Ronaldo's also going to be tower king, it's a question.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has reached 31 gates, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already made 34 hits on his account after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) Lazio Rome's table quarter at Hellas Verona – as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of the FC Bayern.
The record in Italy holds the present Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine won 36 gates for the SSC Naples in 2015/2016.
In August the "Old Lady" of the Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus stands in the eighth finale of the Champions League, but on August 7 against Olympique Lyon a 0:1 playground to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o.-Runde, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal authors registered
Stuttgart - Allen threatened penalties and judgments to the sphere of the fact that car drivers continue gas in countless illegal races on the bathing-wortemberg streets: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal authors in the southwest.
There are no comparative values for the years before, but the Rasers are increasingly working to the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigation procedures were carried out for illegal races, a year later, there were 252 and 151 in the current year until June.
The race was less about organized events, as is shown in the response from the Ministry of Interior to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases the drivers were spontaneously against each other or they would have taken the escape from the police - that is also indicated as illegal races.
The tax was mainly in German men aged 18 to 60.
113 Money penalties - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases, the razers are caught and also asked for a cash check: According to the Ministry of Interior, 113 penalties have been imposed since 2018 and 15 sentences of liberty have been imposed.
However, there are no evidence that the number of illegal authoritarians actually increases.
Rather, other drivers responded more sensitive than before because of the tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more often, said a ministerial speaker.
Particularly popular for races is the motorway 8. Automobile repeatedly bursts the traffic out there to take place and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen driver was caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "rennstrecke"
On the A81, the police even record more races than any other federal motorway.
With a pace limit, it is attempted to brake the shavings on the specially affected section between narrows and aesthetics.
The most high-price sports and luxurious cars often have Swiss marks because the drivers for the high penalties for too fast driving and scientists in the neighboring country to shave to Germany.
For the SPD, the tempo limit must not be reduced on a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 km/h we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD country-day fraction.
"The brake threshold for razor would be significantly higher if you weren't supposed to be legally traveling here and there with 200 kilometres of hours and more."
Rivoir holds less of information or image campaigns: "In this way, the one who disposes of all the rules and is not only at stake with its own life but also with the lives of other transport operators is hardly accessible with reason".
ADAC calls for greater police intervention
On the other hand, the ADAC is not enough: "We assume that the speed limits are not abandoned", says Holger Bach, Head of Department of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also harder controls on the routes concerned.
Not rarely, the high-touring force measurements have become more painful and follow-up serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the race throughout the country, of which two unpopulated in a night crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
In November two young men were supposed to have delivered their authors.
One of the vehicles came from the street, sprang against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old rider died.
21 other people have been injured in the race of the past two years.
However, the Minister of Interior Thomas Strobl considers that sharper penalties are not necessary: "In order to reduce illegal automobile races more severely, law-making needs are not seen," says the Ministry of Interior.

Illegal tuning tours in Nuremberg: Little part of the "Scene"
The officials counted the top of 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, and the police are bilancing.
However, this is only a small part of the presence of the "Autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the scene in question followed the police's appeal.
On the basis of the local vehicles and persons, it should be assumed that they were mainly actors.
In addition, the predominant proportion of those present in the current infection protection provisions, in particular the maintenance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at 1:00 a.m.

The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the involved dragon company: "They have all the beautiful rims which we cannot clothe," says Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are broader, the company must be careful not to harm them.
"The young people are supposed to keep their cars without prejudice."
Numbers of work agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short work
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Work (BA) issuing that, according to its own statement, about 900 suspects of misuse in the short-worker money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies who have shown short-work," said director Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a lot of companies had suddenly requested short-term work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually the test lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
The more precisely we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a few more things.
We're not naïve and have a long breath."
Indications on abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, use the BA analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency force in autumn.
"Will there be much more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The estimates go apart, but we are waffling for the case and already training our employees in the working agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency money."
The figures are still unattractive, said Terzenbach.

North Korea breaches border city to Corona suspicion
To date, North Korea has seen a "brightening success" in its own measures to defend the Corona virus.
Now the country reports about a suspicion for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely locked a major city out of fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been brought into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong, the emergency was imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspicion was confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the dissolved country.
North Korea has not previously registered any infection and has described its defensive measures as "brightening success".
The information was doubted abroad.
According to the reports, the symptoms of the disease were identified by a "extractor" which illegally crossed the military demarketing line between South and North Korea on July 19th.
Three years ago, the person went down to South Korea and had now returned over the border.
For the crossing of borders within the four kilometres wide and mostly still minimized military buffer zone, there was no confirmation from South Korea at first.
However, according to reports from the National News Agency Yonhap, South Korea’s military granted the possibility of an illegal crossing to North Korea.
Investigations were carried out to some people.
According to North Korea, on Saturday due to the suspicion of the suspicion, an urgent meeting of the working party's police office was initiated, chaired by power holder Kim Jong Un.
The "risk situation in Kaesong could cause a fatal and destructive disaster".
Kim has already ordered to be preventive on Friday, "Kaesong completely block and isolate each district and the region of others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had contacted them, had been placed under quarantine.
Accordingly, the central military commission of the party is to examine the "excretion" and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, impose a severe penalty.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Voltage before Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still facing great summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental topics, the members of the body will also vote on the construction plan for the main urban development-oost project," says it, at 16.30 a.m., in the centre of the urban press release to the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, in the Great Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
But, above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversially controversial.
The majority of them are scarce, and most recently in individual committees even reject it depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed from the citizenship and then from the administration and municipal council now not to fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parlamentary opposition", "unfortunately", "speculation", "unvaccination" and "conscious false statements".
"All think to know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for one year as the only representative of the Citizen List of Pforzheim.
In fact, he was after reading the contracts in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit comes cheaper to the city that the Technical Town Hall is contrary to the statements of the City Administration according to grants, whose existence is small convinced to rehabilitation for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than being predicted in the town hall and by the advocates from the economy.
To create the city by its own power and not by a investor: this is his plan B. One day after the small FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also refuses to the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the openkeeping of the Slotberg, the rental of the Ex-Tale for Administrative Areas and a smaller urban renovation in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a key role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
The municipal council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise caused by road traffic, including many temporary reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the politically responsible people in the city are not innocent that this should come because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda of accession to the State of Baden-Württemberg's Climate Protection Pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the urban children's day facilities and the request for entry into the Smart-City funding of the Federal Republic is on the agenda.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to take care of Corona protection measures.
With a lot of delay, Tim Zimmermann starts the new season
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann launches his first season in ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the Liga of the Supersportwagen can take up the regular operation, the first test trips were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was most important to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from attacking his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the porsche from the season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really made a lot of fun."
Have fun also with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite its only 25 years of experience in the GT-Sport, the Dutch has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Stein and I understand us blending and we have made enormous progress at the Lausitzring also from session to session."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series new, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the motodrome.
"It worked quickly and I had little to get used to the route," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community of Count Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you need to meet optimally to be fast."
How fast the roomman is, then, that's gonna happen in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poker a little in the tests," he says.
"In the end, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the record of a tight-driven calendar.
Seven races end up until the beginning of November.
Current status is that no viewers will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formel-1-Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take into the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister for Transport of Quarantine Decision cold caught
According to press reports, the decision of the British Government to put Spain-Urlaubers under quarantine for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided the measure on Saturday.
Because of the corona numbers rise in Spain, the cabinet in London stretched the country from the list of countries from which an entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to return to Quarantine.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returners.
But the arrangement applies to those who are just on the day of holiday, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced over night.
Spain is still considered to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Many ministers should have known in advance that there is the possibility of a quarantine being imposed on Spain for vacationers," said the Labour Minister Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has made the effort to tell Grant Shapps."
Shortly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict base blocks, the infection numbers in the country rise again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries of the British.
From non-necessary travel to the Spanish mainland, the British government is currently recommending that the particularly popular Canary Islands and Balearic Islands are exempt from this.
More than 272,000 infections with the novel corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.

Hurrikan "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help on Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this season over the Atlantic has been landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and severe rainfall now threatened parts of the US State, the National hurricane center of the US Climate Authority NOAA reported on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called the emergency for many districts.
The Corona pandemic in Texas makes the work of the helpers difficult, said Abbott according to US media.
Evacuated for caution
"Every Hurrikan is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
In view of the tower in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is still intensified when one considers that it is fought through an area that is the most affected area of the state of Covid-19".
According to Johns-Hopkins University, some 5,000 people have died in Texas alone, as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called people who had to leave their houses for caution.
They should not ignore practices "to which we have used" such as wearing masks, said the governor according to the CBS station.
It's important that all stayed away.
Therefore, hotel rooms had also been provided in some places.
In addition, Corona should be tested in emergency accommodations.
At first, damage had only been reported from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning resumed
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" was hit on the island of Padre Island right before the Tuscan coast on land.
The tropical storm had previously been elevated to the hurricane of the lowest level.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first adopted and later resumed.
Authorities expected a weakening while "Hanna" continues to move into the country's interior and headed to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, hurrican "Douglas" was travelling on Sunday at wind speeds of about 150 kilometres per hour towards Hawaii.
The hurricane centre, however, expected that he would continue to weaken himself.
According to the prediction, it should be Sunday (local time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
This year, after an prediction of May, NOAA expected an over-average active hurricane season over the Atlantic.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected to be up to six very strong towers, the Authority explained.
On average, there are six orchestras per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop to storms of great strength.
In view of the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, which is a lower average even at ten percent, said at that time.
US President Donald Trump wrote by Twitter that his government watched the storms closely and contacted the countries concerned.

Now it is important to create the special," said Flick.
Until the Munich can deal specifically with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve, the eight-elfinal plane is on the FC Chelsea for the first time.
After the 3:0 in the interplay before the Corona break, the Londoners in the local arena should not become the "Finale dahoam" again in 2012, like the lost "Finale dahoam".
"We have to go through the door for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and tank trust with a good game," asked Flick.

31 players welcomed him at the Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Shop Leroy Sané, who first met all the new colleagues on the square after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has inserted himself well like all the new ones," said Flick.
However, instead of talking about the new season when Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to co-train, Flick would prefer to talk about the current title project of the German series championship.
After days of single and small group training, the Londonians are now trained in team strength, in contrast to the Flick ensemble in the game rhythm.
Afterwards, the Munich could stand a quarter final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semifinale, Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.

At the tournament with Neuner-Mannschaften, it was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the performers were involved, including the immigration volunteer Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the king's season is not secured.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to shorten its world championship
Since the number of continents that are required cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to award the WM titles.
But all the American races were rejected.
Racing calendar becomes more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula-1 season continues to take shape.
The Grand Prix, which was previously confirmed, added three further race courses under the week.
In October the Nürburgring in Germany and the Portuguese Portimão will be rided.
On the first November Lewis Hamilton and Co. fight on the Italian traditional race track in Imola for WM points.
This includes the 2020 racing calendar, according to current status, 13 runs.
"We are pleased that we continue to achieve great progress in the completion of our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula-1-Boss Chase Carey.
Overall, 15 to 18 races are expected to be completed in the king's class of motor sports during this extraordinary season.

Rules require races on three continents

Even if, as currently planned, only on two continents will be driven, there will be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to grant the titles under appeal to "extraordinary circumstances" due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional season start in Australia in March had to be canceled in the short term due to the coronic crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a topic.
In addition, the Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Absage strikes criticism in Brazil
Due to the stressed Corona situation, the races in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We look forward to being with them in the next season," Carey said.
The American race's dismissal, especially in Brazil, showed criticism: "The abstention was not surprising for us, but the reasons for this we cannot accept," said Tamas Rohonyi, Promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
In the area of São Paulo, infections are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams that do not want to drive to Brazil would also not justify a dismissal.
We are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in the well-known letight show by Stephen Colbert via video switch and explained in the interview what she had in her mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate Atkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest by video switch in a popular US-Latenight show.
She said, among other things, about her fight against the powers of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "böse look" at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been aware of her intimate use for the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known Letight show about her plans in the future as well as her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Letight-Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your mission and led a longer interview with the Swedish.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the powers of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to direct the focus from the climate crisis," she shocked.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children goes on the road" she experienced.
Heads of State and leaders who spot at them in social media or even try to make them silence, she finds "beautiful," as you show the reactions "because they have no other answer to them".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she had a bitterly evil look after US President Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the Actvistin sailed over the Atlantic, its expressive view was captured by the cameras and has been seen by countless people on the Internet since then.
From the short clip a GIF was created, i.e. an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US President at this moment?
On the relatively open question of Stephen Colbert, she answered only briefly un dry: "To be honest, I believe that no further explanation is needed."
With the preparatory answer, the experienced satirician Colbert probably hadn't expected and disappeared shortly laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?"-screaming about the principles of climate protection, she remained in mind at the climate conference.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a backway ride: after a rapid rise with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply down and then slowly upward.
Now Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult adherent: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, and on Saturday, family members informed in an official opinion that another opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton appreciated Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the longest legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamed instrumental hat "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a backway ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes without him.
There should have been disputes, among other things, because Green wanted to spend all the profits of the group for well-being purposes.
He began to appear in wide garments and with large crucifix.
Also psychic problems should have played a role.
Three years after the founding, Green left the band in 1970.
It followed a social declining.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
Green was treated in the psychiatrie for a long time.
During a large part of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the surface of the image.
He was supposed to live on the street, worked as cemetery gardeners and spent a time in an Israeli Kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish worker family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
In young years he was enthusiastic for US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At 11 years of age, he learned the first guitar attacks.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play professional guitar and five years later, as a leader guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners, he got the chance to stand on stage.
Later, he was engaged in the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues-Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967, together with his Bluesbreakers-Collegen Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group the first number 1-hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
But the fast ascension soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not force the media rum, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
The life between music and addiction he commented later in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number-1-hit."
At the end of the decade, Green in 1979 was surprisingly a success of respect with a album inspired by religious subjects.
Fleetwood Mac flames on a wave of success without it in new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo results, Green did not succeed in a larger comeback until he re-started in 1996 with a group of friends musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star returned to the earth at that time.
Free of drugs, Green published some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band resolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was a blues lie in life - and with his gentle sound, one of the most influential guitarists in the past decades.
