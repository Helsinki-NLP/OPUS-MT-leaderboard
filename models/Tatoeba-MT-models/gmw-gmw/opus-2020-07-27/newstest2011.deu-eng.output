What is she supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know a full-depth place, nor the "conditory".
The new Councillors of the capital from the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS at the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once "clopped" members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as they dominate the notorical snake that has occupied in recent years in which today's coalition partners were on the row in Prague.
The codated vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the flooded era of the Supreme Mayor Pavel Bém, has been awarded some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it was shown that the new councils do something in the dark about these new terms.
They say that at least.
"Who is full place?"
"No idea."
"I am rather a new man in Prague's politics," responded Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for Culture, to the test of the "Paten-Wortschatz".
But also Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use occasionally."
"And I don't think much of snake."
From the vocabulary published in the journal Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial section picked out six terms, especially those notorically linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "great Prager Golfloch", "going into the conditure", "tigernacken", "verrating of the capital" and "bleaching".
Three Prager councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future chief of Prague's school, first promised his participation in the conversation, but then not even took the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused the test from the beginning.
"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois Democrats talk to each other, I don't judge about it."
"For me, how we understand in the framework of our programmes is important," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukaš Kaucký was supposedly not recognized in the headline mentioned above that the influential entrepreneur and friend of Bém, Roman Janoušek, was spoken of.
The term "Voldemort" Kaucky says nothing at all and the only term that he correctly advised during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, but added to safety: "But I know that rather from the newspaper."
And reluctantly, "I'll probably have to give a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý correctly as a tunnel Blanka.
However, both Social Democrats also know for whom the term "Voldemort" stands and Lukaš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and what it means to "go into the conditory".
"I believe that this means to go to some Prager gastronomy business," Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution if you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he regrets that he made these knowledge rather from the newspaper than that he would be owned by this vocabulary.
In fact, it seems that there is not a similarly bourgeois snake among the Social Democrats to judge the test participants.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves on the name, we also use shortcuts or nicknames again," says the chairman of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - by his party companions salopp called "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know whether my colleagues also call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see - he works there.
Rather Weinert is friendly for the party's associates of the "Opa" or less friendly of the "Alte", the representative Miroslav Poche, who noticed before the elections by acting in the party sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego-Figur).
Nicknames are thus the only one that allows social democrats in intra-party language use.
Hulínský does not supposedly like it to be called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the President of Prague.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber-Knüppel-Recht" is supposed to have done that Petr Hulínský has acquired his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to undermine the torture of "hexen" and published a brochure
In Burkina Faso, women who are marked for witches usually show some common social features.
They belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
If one of these women becomes "the witch," she will be strictly isolated so that she cannot be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women remain free of this because they help and bear children in the work," describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than one hundred women who were exiled from their communities.
The local government now decided to oppose this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, a brochure was published that is intended to undermine the "hex tracking".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said the newspaper "the standard" to the dilemma of written information.
However, hexia is also going to be offended in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they smote them with petroleum and just burned them.
This incident also reported the server BBC.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter would have been only a meeting of unhappy circumstances.
According to their version, oil was flamed, which is used for ritual salmons.
And it is, after the group has tried to "each evil spirit" out of the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Friends of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least strives to relieve the witch hunt, the Gambian president has ordinaryly intervened in the last year of the president itself.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after his aunt's death, unfolded a monstrous witch hunt, as they allegedly had part of their death and now would try to kill the President himself by black magic."
"To that he called Shamane from nearby Guinea to help who, in the accompanying of policemen, soldiers and the president's body warrior, violently kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the farm of the president in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in their report.
On the farm, the occupied people were forced to drink an absorption of plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of the international pressure, the almost a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant from Bakala: he heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older man is just leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm, a map with three new rental contracts for three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who just forbids a penalty.
All three have just increased the rent in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rents, the son is to ride the next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there isn't even running warm water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he tips with his finger on the new hire contract of the son, to whose signature he has a perfection.
"But what - I signed," he says half a vote and half a resignation.
The Civil Association BytyOKD.cz, which referred to the new lease conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, in which they intend to publish an instruction on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man just wins off.
"One says this, the other one does it," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region becomes the major "deregulation laboratories".
After a new year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not pay any market-friendly rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG maintenance room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and breaking nine o'clock in the morning this Tuesday.
Right next to the door, the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller are on her.
"May 2011", a special button is illuminated on the touch screen.
Shortly tipped and the device is already spucking out a number list.
We have hardly deciphered the number "157" and already pept it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
A half a second later, you're on the row.
Something later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room seems not to be the new rental.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and similar.
From mid-November, the Kuverts in the region of Ostrava flourish with the new rental contracts most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests an increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client center has been open since November 18th.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, that's just the beginning," the ladies behind the switch respond after a moment when the "Client" gets out as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former mining apartments are a brilliant theme.
Before the elections, Parliament Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD had raised this issue quite loud, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even the WC-Brille could switch them out," the man mentioned in the beginning makes himself air.
So far, according to the employees, especially pensioners are on the switch to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rental discount that promises RPG when signing the special offer in time.
In the enjoyment of a half-reduced February rental, the other tenants will also come to sign the new rental contract until 15 December.
Until now, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is all but overloaded by demands.
"From yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rentals were here in 2011," the switching officers estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements where necessary, both on their websites and wall panels.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be threatening, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its websites.
"There's no one going before court," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the road in front of the client center gives her at least some right.
"I have 13.000 (crown) pensions, of which 5,000 remain for me for dinner, where I should take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee gets insecure.
"See Mal."
"Lord Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so people are still waiting for," she recalls.
The regulated rental ends in most of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, the increase in tenants is an economic necessity.
"The existing height of the rentals is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the RPG Byty's apartment portfolio, and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants in charge is, according to the owners of the house, the main reason for the increase in tenants.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments between 2005 and 2010 from the rentals received, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the polder seats in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red illuminating information occurs again and again.
"The tenants increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"This means at least 7.50 CZK per square metre and month," read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments the rent will remain at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not lead the rent to the high level, but takes place gradually within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposes another obligation: all the income from the tenant increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the heat insulation.
But - first of all, these are to benefit those who sign the agreements on tenants increase.
The architects saw a - the office also belongs to a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-child garden here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playing place on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the staff of Arch.Design last year.
The Arch.Design projecting and architectural office, from which ateliers are a number of well-known Brunners buildings, counted from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the rooms for his company mini-kindergarten.
In a wiser perspective, because most of its 90 employees (inside) are in the baby tree older and the company is located to return to their workplace as quickly as possible.
Together with the possibility of shortening work, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has offered its employees in the concept of their social program.
The construction engineers have made it easier to put their demanding occupation and child care under a hat.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the staff of Arch.Design and with the support of the management, they have been able to gain funding from the European Union and from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operation Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (advantages of 2.8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment were provided and qualified staff and businesses are provided for the duration of 2 years.
After the exhaustion of the funding (2 years) the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the mini-kindergarten 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place a whole year, with the company Economy Rating actively assisted in the processing of applications.
The children care for fully qualified staff - a nurse and a pediatric teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age limitations, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day changes over several children.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly compatible with the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although this is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-kindergarten is still comparable to the pre-education framework programme.
The children play not only here, but above all they are given excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-education, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What is more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive business environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and so the stress is not in the late pick-up of the children from a far-distance kindergarten.
The parents therefore use their working time more productive.
No wonder there are natural and loyal employer relationships.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies who offer significant benefits in the application of new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof moors like the back of a prehistoric ecse, the staircases like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are screwed fish walls.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic shapes received the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles splitters and mosaics, the façades that reminiscent of scraps and all presently soft lines, all these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living.
It is noted that it is only when it comes to more precise reputation that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night the whole façade is even more plastic, dramatic and special lighting enhances the shine of the colors.
The same vibrant lines and swallowed shapes also dominate the inside of the house.
Wave-like shaped wood copies the window frames, lands, decorative elements of doors, even gambling holes and looses.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district of Passeig de Grácia no. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese performed.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the prosperous industrial Josep Batlló, originally stood on the abbreviation of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea Gaudís for an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
The Casa Batlló rental house, however, designed Antoni Gaudí not alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics at the facade were his idea.
However, many other artists and artists were also involved in the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in Güell Park, where there are also other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nicknames "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "gaining house".
It is also said that on the top of the building is the sword of Saint Georg, the patron of Catalonia.
But also other sculpture elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the time.
Something bizars already encourage their 45-degrees.
In his work, Gaudí ignored all the construction regulations of that time and couldn't be disturbed by them.
Before the construction of the city, he obtained the corresponding construction permit, but the information given by him on the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city's fathers were so distressed in the completion that they demanded remediation two years later.
Among other things, the Councillors also argued that the construction with its pillars even entered the public side.
However, there was no further changes, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the visit to the district, Josep Batlló asked for the authorization of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly given to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the third floor the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment were located.
The ground floor was deported to a jewelry shop.
The entire six-story building passes through a staircase to the roof terrace.
Through the fundamental elements of the conversion, all the right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the interconnection of rooms.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors, so a larger society could easily plauder without a certain intimacy in the event of more confidential discussions.
The house also received a rather unusual roof and two more floors by Gaudí's conversion except a new façade.
Gaudí's game is also impressive with light as well as the blue and white glassed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the light courts.
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply made the principle of nuts that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the World Heritage List of Unesco in 2005, can visit everyone today.
On the first floor the most spacious and most beautiful apartment is made available to the public.
The house owners decided only in the year to this step and this from the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the famous Creator.
When one found that this is a fairly lonely business, the visits were kept, and they were also extended to further common and roof floors, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building monument is not a pappenstiel, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist exhibitions receive 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rose? Women have different wishes than men
Not the finest bed frame, but the quality of the bed surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these need to complement themselves harmoniously in order to meet the needs of the specific user.
Many things play a role in selection - weight, size, health condition and not least the sex of sleeper.
Similarly, the interior in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated is also important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited as they need much longer to become "warm".
In addition, they are far more difficult than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And they should be used regularly.
For if they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and still lie on a solid plate, moisture arises: it is not excluded that they form under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used.
Whoever had been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses are common with soft layers, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Well all ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"They simply need a soft layer of Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam - a shape-daked polymer) for their chickens, heels and hips."
"I recommend these, among other things, sugar ill people who are suffering from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in pollen term furniture.
That's why I've been giving many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers have given these mattresses with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses include the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of the Visco scheme.
This "wonder" actually works very simple.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it actually swims on the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, in the night, you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wund fire).
When choosing the mattress size, the length of the foot soles should still be calculated, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, who is large at the 180 cm, needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleeves should be available at least 90 cm, so together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
The comfort half and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bedwidth: "If you are on your back, you should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the enthusiasm of the Polsters and Space Eaters, who has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and also presents this topic at professional schools.
At a double bed, everyone needs a pink and its own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else remains than assembling the rost at different heights and that is not possible at any bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should fall on the form layer and the fine brush.
"With the hand or when the feathers are put, you can't feel it," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special stainless steel type.
Whole-pounded beds with mattress and underlage as well as together grown Siamzwillings have nothing to search in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the reference cannot be washed, which is already in progress today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat in one night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress becomes slowly a huge (and stuck seven).
This is also why professionals reject advertising logan that promises a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong warranty in mattresses.
Every thing has her when and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shy the hygiene of the washable, deductable remunerations, yet it is recommended to use a mattress shoe that can be easily deducted and washed.
Even though today mattress covers are usually made with round zipper, so that after opening you get two halfs (especially important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially executed alone, often as the inequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in the bed instead of a roste?
Get out of it!
Or highest for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
They should also prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if they are not already in it) and mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with such pocket springs and fine pounds.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a subsection.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (or combinations of latex and coconuts) are suitable for non-adjustable latten rosts with a larger number of latten, i.e. 28 and more springs, with lantern support and the possibility of regulating the latten hardness.
No mattresses with feather skeleton belong to adjustable lamb rust, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to setting the stiff of the springs, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fastening of the feathers, which enables you to impress the feather bars or to invert even so that they allow the punctual insink of the shoulder of the sleeve.
In particular, for men with wide shoulders, an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area in herren mattresses.
It is also thought of the women - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, pointslastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or stainless steel are determined with pointslastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion springing.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (over large and full) head cushion to the right mattress and right rust, most benefits will be lost again.
Here too a rule: the head cushion should support the head, its tips should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears as it likes, for example, the Scandinavier.
In the side position, the head cushion (coincidence with the school pension load zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have been common with the once (filled with hay) straw sacks.
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their emulsions.
The new magic word "Bio" is also known for mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, it is used for the production of polyurethane foams of more and more natural oils, such as ricinus and soya oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is known for mattresses, which consists of purely natural materials," explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the production of mattress coverages - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance during sleep.
Here, too, one makes a difference between man and woman.
While a "cooling" plant extract is used in men from birch leaves so that the mattress coating can absorb the heat and cool the body, the ratios for women have "warming" effect.
Extractions from red pepper shoes stimulate the blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm during sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Matrats made of cold foam (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercially common polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffs (heards) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-son mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are.
However, for a high-quality mattress you have 7000 crowns and more to rape.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aid.
The first Czech company, Gumotex, was granted this advantage.
You can see saving the mattress and the roast isn't so easy.
There are occasionally special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with a visco-shame memory related to 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of the viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the beginning.
Tempur becomes soft at warmth, in cool environment it turns down again.
Thus it fits perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases sleeping comfort.
However, fish coelastic foams are not only used in mattresses but also in other health products, such as in special peppers to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Indigenous manufacturers, for example, use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have the kids under control
The fear of your own children grows and thus considers more and more parents to monitor them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for cars, can order as well people, which would be helpful in such cases as recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappears.
The device is currently as large as a cigarette box, but soon it should not be bigger than a bracelet clock.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and horror, so they look for ways and means to protect their children better.
Also for the price of affecting their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about herum pioneers, but about an effective means of reducing the probability of tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in any case there can be a misuse of such devices, for example, if you put it in your pocket, without he knows it, but we haven't had any such case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
However, in his opinion, the child should always know what purpose the "sheep" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková, however, points out that if a child doesn't wear such a thing, it simply unfolds it.
"Even very little children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
"The phones at first raised great expectations with the parents, but they can turn off as easily as these new surveillance devices," Ms. Bočková says.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappers, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be sorted."
"Today it's the cell phone."
"If such surveillance devices find a broader use, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would be safely accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always a step ahead," says the psychologist.
It admits, however, that similar devices can be very helpful in sudden attacks by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the RC Monitoring Society, the location services offer both for cars and for people, can help the existence of such a device even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it records the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it was immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"With more expensive devices, even an inclination knife is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain unmoved, the device immediately sends a warning with reference to the position," says Mr Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to play a special software.
The problem of the current positioning devices is that it concerns either devices in stringent wooden box size, the trailers similar to or smaller mobile phones.
It's always the risk of losing it.
According to Mr Pilin from the Macro Weil, we test devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Of he notices that after some time, what the police give a time forecast," he adds.
No matter in what direction the development is going - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So to combine the positioning function with the GPS system (now like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignorances that you could turn all over the Czech Republic but keep only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometres of ignorance, fired with explosions.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometres of Zündschnur to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have evacuated for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignorance - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignorance of STV Group's shareholding company, a.s. for the lobby of 40 million crowns.
In his reason for purchasing this huge amount of Zündschnur, the Generalstab answered MF DNES that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of Zündschnur annually.
According to the research by army pyrotechnicians that MF DNES responded to it, this statement shows that the entire army would have to complete an extremely intense pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and predators.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and General Army Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only so could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition can be justified halfways.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But these armies would also be sufficient for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies to the training of every new professional soldier two meters of ignorance, the army has created a calm supply for the 225 years mentioned, even under the rising need of the pioneer and special units.
In this respect, soldiers of the rapid use brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for hand-fire weapons, so that shooting exercises of the missing funds are severely restricted.
To be silent from the underwear deficiency.
"I'm not going into why they buy such many ignorances from us."
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we want to meet as a dealer most widely," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignorance with it that the army would have covered with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year period of use of the ignorance and police and army pyro technicians of only two years.
"By perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, but who wants to remain unnamed to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
These tests, however, are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument from the Ministry of Defence is the quantitative debate for the 445 kilometres of ignorance.
"They cost us sixty percent less than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," spokesperson Pejšek tells us the position of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defense.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of ignorant pyrotechnicians from the police, liquidating the ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brotherly army, has been about 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police always order only such amounts of this ammunition that it can consume before the expiry of the duration of use.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, it is also possible to make flexible purchases more modern and thus also reliable ignorances open.
The Ministry of Defence has a huge problem in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from times of the Warsaw Treaty when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak People's Army was preparing for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who spoke to MF DNES, the Czech forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old ignorance, which she has purchased so "favourable" today.
Until today, the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition
The victorious placement in the competition "Klein businesses of the year" helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
During the past year, Lukaš Pytloun from Liberec became a winner of the competition "Small Enterprise of the Year".
The story of his success is a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun was happy to travel.
Only abroad he became aware that in Liberec there are no good accommodations at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and using a bank credit he acquired a building house with five apartments.
Remember that he was then a university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous company.
"The price-quality ratio then angryed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the whole profit into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in only seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec he has been able to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them has recently been the 4 star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties at the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the entrepreneur number One of last year.
"Great share of this license sales to operate hotels had just the victory in the competition "Company of the Year", Mr. Pytloun adds recognition.
The victory has brought him more familiarity, even popularity in Liberec and the surroundings.
"The people recognized me on the street, often congratulated me even afterwards, and I have to say that was really good," he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't need to win at the same time, any visual makeup is good.
He says that he is benefiting from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have happened.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I have regular business relations so far."
He believes that the fame associated with the success is also a little on each of his employees.
And there he has the seventy.
"I notice more loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that is granted general recognition."
I really see this not only as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just something in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modest.
My followers I wish a quieter year than we had it in Farmet
The victory was quickly dissolved from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst one behind.
The prize for the first rank of Vodafone Competition in the year last year, Karel Žůárský, the farmet company owner.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made from the small tool building in Česká Scalice to steam a company out of the ground that makes hundreds of millions of transactions.
"I can say that this assessment has not only encouraged me myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the previous year’s winner.
At the beginning of the farmet's company history, the effort was to do something useful.
And when the state offered a small workshop to the pocket for his father, Karel Žůárský, as a compensation for the property confiscated by the Communist, he didn't hesitate for a long time, let his career in the company in which he was working until then, sausing and founding his own company for the production of plastic tunnels with a few camerads of his father.
Shortly later, they began to concentrate on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only because of the success in the abovementioned competition and its medialization, it has also entered into the consciousness of non-facility.
"Not only that our customers have seen the farmet brand more intensely now, our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country to achieve greater value," says Karel Žůárský.
Last year, however, farmet was not only in the sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tools.
The crisis, which at the time was even less shaken by citizens, but especially by companies, reached their peak - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and limit the purchase of new institutions and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't escape this situation."
"The turnover decreased by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even take to releases," explains Karel Žůárský
A viable company may also have to take such unpopular measures.
However, it was possible to get the situation into control and keep the company in the black numbers, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to cut off - in investment in research and development.
"With the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žůárský.
Everything proves that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy at victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel Žůárský.
A survey of opinions that is cleaning up with nonsense rules
For the fourth time, the survey on the "Absurdity of the Year" is part of the entrepreneurship competition.
Some insane regulations have already succeeded in creating out of the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next year of the survey "Absurdity of the Year", the duty was to create documents on authorities available online.
Thus, more than one third of non-4 thousand entrepreneurs decided.
So the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have called him by two mouse clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the survey.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require extractions from the commercial register in future in the case of social insurance payments," said the spokesman of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the survey "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all the rules and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to fulfill and lift the insane ones.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the Czech Economic News (HN) and enjoys popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people had participated in the vote last year, it was four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to hamper corporate activity.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a leading role in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and commercials in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic takes the 74th rank in terms of the business conditions, compared to the previous year, one by eight places worse placement.
The competition absurdity of the year was launched for the first time in the year and plays every year after the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the editorial conclusion of the competition at the end of September.
For registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz is used. Afterwards, the organizer of the competition searches for seven candidates for the "Anti prize" and allows the public to vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It triumphs the absurdity that most votes gets.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105, meaningless regulations and orders have been registered on this year's survey.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to pay toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to prepare every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The calling of competition at the Prague Wenzelsplatz at the beginning of November is part of a harp in which personalities of political and public life are also regularly involved.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and commercial operators of the Czech Republic, as well as Petr Kužel, President of the Chair of Trade of the Czech Republic at the highlight of the competition with the party.
"Where the State throws the entrepreneurs between the legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so it is my goal to raise at least thirty paragrafs each year which are still unnecessary to entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create unwise orders from the world show effect.
In 2007, people mostly disrupted the entrepreneurs' duty to have to report three days in advance to the commercial office in the place of their permanent operating site to travel to an exhibition or Kirmes with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was repealed by a novel of the commercial law.
The duty to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report services to the Labour Office of workers up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation it imposed on physiotherapists was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personnel waags in the speaking room.
This regulation was somewhat milded by the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to refrigerator fell away.
A new category credits societally responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A newness in this year's fifth year's competition of the economic newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of Vodafon's mobile company, the caller and guaranteeer of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
This year's first year of this special sub-category of Vodafon's main competition company reported companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspirative and bow enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrally in the subject of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator support and consideration.
This is, for example, about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, which then participated in numerous tournaments in various sports types.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, who has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also carries for its health-related disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of their employees, for whom they were recognized as "responsively-conscious company in the Central Bohemia region", and in the competition Vodafone Company of the year she held the third ranking in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won a flowing and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours a week and this was without a proportional wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company is mainly shopping with Czech manufacturers, supporting citizens' initiatives in their surroundings and working according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible to keep the impact of our entrepreneurial activity and administration on the environment as low as possible," explains her managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem is again located in the health of its employees and therefore it has created them to all notebooks ergonomic chairs and keyboards, and it also promotes homework in their employees and in company operations it uses carding services offered by a locally protected workshop.
"We also support the Foundation "Menschen in Not", which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbader Region is worth mentioning, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We offer our employees contributions to nursing, working paths, to increase their qualifications and for holidays," says Josef Strapáč of the building company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Mährisch-Schlesische Region.
On the category of responsible company of the year, all district philosophers of the Vodafon Competition were automatically logged in company of the year, which answered the questions of the questionnaire submitted to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incompletely completed answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the review by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the contesting companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "responsible company of the year", but they were not disqualified for this reason in the main competition Vodafone company of the year."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible because it is just a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests at a public invitation to tender
In the building of the Bodenfonds in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took arrests in the last days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was carried out from the detectives in handcuffs.
This was said to have tried to manipulate a public competition that is just taking place in order to manipulate restitution claims in such a way that the property offered in the competition would be a specific interested person.
This is supposed to have paid Luboš G. a half million for it.
"I can only confirm at this time that the police persecute a person because of the offence of fraudulent acts in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the chief of the Pilsner Prosecutor of the newspaper "Právo", she could not give further details on the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In the way that he could manipulate public competition, it is only possible to speculate about it in view of the splendid official information.
The spokesperson of the Lubomír Černá Soil Fund pointed to the question of Právo that the police actually took arrests in the Pilsner side of the Bodenfonds and this during public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she concreted.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct term "Requirement for the bidding of claims for the transfer of land according to the ground law" and would take place in cases where several applicants would show interest in the property offered.
"These persons, in the context of the call, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be compensated by the transfer than the requested land value."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is defined and the soil fund then transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokesman of the Fund.
Luboš G. was obviously available for information who had notified himself on the request and since he was self-authorized, since he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered an interest in the property that he withdraws from the competition.
Obviously against a fat invention.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for the reason he had such a large amount of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of Václav Sankota's former head of the Václav Sankota Fund, which was persecuted by criminal law because he was released in substitutes of land, which had already been devised by site decisions on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G., for example, acquired lands intended for the construction of public streets, more precisely, where the construction of the accessmagistral was planned to the Borské pole industry area.
Later, he exchanged this very favorably with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the property.
At that time, the town hall had to give a heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the property.
The housing costs of households rise by a few hundred monthly
The households must not only expect higher costs for all energy types from January, but also higher water and waste water charges and remote heat and some places also grow rentals.
Families will have to pull more out of the wallet as from January to January.
Electricity will be increased by 4.6 percent, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth of more for water supplies and in some places also defense remote heat supplies.
In the entirety of electricity, housing costs a few hundred crowns more each year.
Strong electricity prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so the strong support for electricity generation from renewable sources, namely photovoltaic plants.
Although gas is only moderately expensive, this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too, some hundred crowns are expected to be more per year.
While electricity and gas become expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for remote heating vary from city to city.
Priority increases are especially planned for larger locations.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more monthly for remote heating up to 50 crowns, more than 1000 crowns more a year paid families in Liberec.
In turn, the inhabitants of Prague are threatening 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in case the city increases infrastructure rentals.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, is still one of the lowest.
In the North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and waste water charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Excellent rental price increases can be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation falls away from January.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rent by a hundred percent from January.
Anyone who does not agree with this tenant increase wants the company judicial interests.
The regulated rentals, which are still in almost 300,000 apartments today, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drunk with Fernet and Rum Bier is out - it just works too slow
Fernet, Rum and Wodka, somehow also a good whisky that the father was stolen from the bar.
These are the beverages whose enjoyment of drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen must be most not treated.
No exception are children who have to sleep their cater repeatedly in the hospital.
This is shown by the experiences of doctors faced with similar cases in the inclusion of the children's departments of clinics.
"Bier or wine are completely out of fashion because it simply takes too long until you are drunk."
"The trend today is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the director of the children's department in the medieval Hořovice clinic.
"Whisky, if it succeeds to evade the father a bottle from the bar, and if not, at least Fernet or Wodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the boss doctor.
The spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová judges him.
"The most common thing is about Fernet or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, namely in primary schools."
"Individually, it was also about Slibowitz, who is taken from home," said Mrs. Jurinová.
According to President Pelikán, 13- or 14-year-old drinkers are no exception in hospitalization.
In front of the Hořovice hospital, he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Pediatric Department of the Hospital of Motol, where the rescue cars delivered drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"They started her career at the age of 12 when she was first delivered alcohol in the blood with 3.5 promilles and still in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice on any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't seem strange that her daughter didn't get home for 48 hours," the boss doctor wondered.
Especially the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance in exploring with their own spouses is considered to be one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, a real dependence in the true sense of the word is not happening in children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
In those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains Chefarzt Pelikán.
According to the speaker of the Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, about 40 drunk children were admitted to the local department for child and youth medicine until mid November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospital stays are included in statistics.
Drinked children who are brought home by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police after ambulance treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink a bottle of Schnaps in the schoolbank, Mr Pelikán says there are three years of amplitudes on which a hundred percent is abandoned: Walpurgisnacht, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for distress because of the bad testimony or for joy in the holidays."
"In Walpurgisnight I have experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who will fight only with an unpleasant cater the next day.
The headaches of the morning afterwards, which come from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be driven in the hospital with a liquid infusion with glucose and nutrients missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better, because after the "great" experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood, without hurting somewhere."
"They are only a little confused about where they are," admits Dr Pelikán, sometimes by inflicting the patient the good mood by telling them the costs that they will cost the treatment.
Because the transportation with the rescue car and the night in an acute bed comes well and enjoys a few thirty thousand crowns.
"I used it as a educational tool once and again when I foresee the children directly at the visits, what cost her drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays all over to earn the money for one such feather," added Dr Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance schemes do not take action by regression procedures to charge the costs of parents for the healing of drunk children.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 of a total of five, which exchanged the Czech Ministry of Defense against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Sevilla on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
It's the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
They had only been seen abroad at Manövern or Flight Shows.
This is about the flightable two-seat version L-159T1, operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three planes are one-seated L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the Omnipol company - has taken it over last week.
When it expedits the aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
In turn, the one-sided L-159 fighter was separated from long-term deposited planes, without further deposits and investments from the department's reserve.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to come out without two-seat fighters, since the Ministry of Defense signed a 200-million treaty with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second wants to take it up to the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to implementing the fight aircraft in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"In the contract, it is clear that the company is EADS operator of aircraft L-159 and that they should serve to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore a matter of the buyer in what way he realizes the matter," said Pejšek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange trade of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was still approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At that time, the Ministry of Defense had not issued a tender procedure for purchasing, but addressed EADS directly.
The Defense Office then argued that this exchange would support the future exports of L-159 to the abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines from which she used only 24, the rest she wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa is likely to have a legal replay.
The European Commission, in fact, accused the Czech Ministry of Defense at the European Court of Justice, for the reason that the planes had to be selected on the basis of a whole-European invitation to tender and not on the basis of a single manufacturer's response.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer point finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose pointer fingers are longer than the ring finger are apparently exposed to a lower risk of illicit prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and, in particular, in men up to sixty," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, Professor at the Cancer Research Institute at Warwick University.
The finger could help determine which men should be subject to a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Mrs Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer with her colleagues in Britain, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study, the point finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the likelihood of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of the men whose ring and point fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose pointer fingers were longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33 percent, in men up to 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already formed in prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones that the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less Testosterone corresponds to a longer point finger.
Earlier research showed that the testosterone has accelerates prostate cancer growth.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech genetician and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was known fleetingly, yet he does not think the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer "to date".
Czechia in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just as the largest part of Europe, Czechia is also under a snow ceiling on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walkways are mostly steady snow, the winter servicers were all night on axis.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is locked some accidents of trucks and trucks and also the D1 at Brno stands towards Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
In kilometres 91, a truck crashed, two trucks at kilometres 93 hit together, in this accident there are injuries.
A few cars are also in the street grave.
There are also problems at kilometres 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks have been collapsed here too.
The drivers should leave Brno at kilometers 190 or drive over Brno and get up at kilometers 182 at the town of Kývalka.
There, there are kilometres of studs.
Also on the D11, an accident has happened and that is the same at the access to Prague.
In Prague itself is a several centimeter thick snow ceiling and the thermometer shows minus 7 degrees Celsius.
Car colonies, for example, form in the Prosek district, also the road Štěrboholská is completely hidden.
The safest means of transport is in any case the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis board meets.
There are problems also at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast train connections because of snow.
For example, there are problems on the Prague - Kralupy route or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be decisively informed about the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed from Wednesday to 5 a.m. at 11 a.m. tonight.
Most streets in southern ferries are only available with increased caution.
Around Vyškov, three sideways are totally unfitable, in the surroundings of Brno form snow explosions and in the vicinity of Blansko, snow frozens are forced to use on some higher streets.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
You will also need to use snow mills to clear snow.
When they get rid of again, they can't be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of white carpaths.
On the streets, which are only allowed to be stretched with inert scatters for nature conservation, there is a thick snow ceiling of up to five centimetres, ČTK quoted.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimetres of new snow fell, most in northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimetres.
In the Mährisch-Schlesian region, up to 15 centimeters of neusnee fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it stops to cut slowly.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, which is so far known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon influences the conflict with the Taliban there and shifts the force relationship in favor.
The new weapon is like a super-general cannon.
Because your projectiles are led to the destination by laser with a meeting security of only a few meters.
The special shots of caliber 25 mm, designed for this gun and containing high explosive explosives, work practically like small granates.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode at any point of their ballistic airway not only when they hit the target, but also at any point.
That means that you can use them against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the grave.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splitter rain from above can easily dispose of it.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new fighting gun is the first infantry weapon that makes "intelligent" technologies useful.
"The soldier is basically doing so: he looks at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins a precise visibility point after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to print off.
"Let's say, you measured 543 m."
"If you are pushed down, the gun is recharging and shooting the shot to the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are shifted
The company Fujitsu shifts its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their jobs from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu shifts its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year 400 women and men will move their jobs from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, which is a large office complex at Lyoner Street in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
One spokesperson of Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should be additional 100 jobs of the Group, which were previously distributed to the region.
The offer had been very attractive, and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park were better addressed to the work of the employees.
Fujitsu was also a tenant in Bad Homburg.
The managing director Bernd Wagner said: "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region last brought joy to the winners and disappointment among losers.
The Frankfurt economic deputy Mark Frank (CDU) said that it was once a global player.
This is a "great-like venue of location".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburg Oberbürgermeister Michael Korwisi (Die Grünen) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early by the management of the intention.
"We obviously offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at the Marienbader place.
Finally, economic reasons would have been the result.
Now it is about to prevent a long level of void in such a prominent position.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at the Town Hall and the neighbouring "Klein Vertical" with the rest of the buildings at the Marienbader Square ten years ago belonged to the most controversial construction projects of the Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city street was created between the railway station and the town hall, which caused criticism, both because of the massive construction of the areas used as part of the parking space and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still connected to Siemens, covered the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu conucers in Tokyo call themselves the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employed is Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the 20-year-old complex - the name plays on its stern-shaped groundrise - the central association of electrical engineering and electronics industry has its seat.
Amazon saves server - Threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the release platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is supposed to stay in England.
In the United States, the explosion platform of Wikileaks is increasingly under fire.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
However, the prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to the Boykott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileak's founder Julian Assange, who stands on Interpol's flag lists, is to be held after a newspaper report in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks is drowned by Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of freedom," the unveiled activists informed Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had withdrawn from Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic disciplines in order to cope with the high number of access to the documents.
By Twitter, Wikileaks continued to say: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped the use of his servers by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's employees had been investigating, the TV channel CNN reported on the Lovermans Office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a Boykott, reported by the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman therefore called on the platform to refuse the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, immortal and reluctant action poses our national security and threatens around the globe life," said a communication from the partyless senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks distribute stolen materials in his efforts."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is searched for by the authorities in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on the list of interpol flagships.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian stays in Britain, the exact location is Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigations in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls after Julian Assange's murder."
That's why Assange was right to fear his security, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to be hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had asked that the responsible person for the Wikileaks disclosures should be accused and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, a consultant of government chief Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said on television, Assange should be "getted" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and the Assange, a slap exchange was burned.
The speaker of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "because of ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had requested the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton, if it was responsible for recently announced spionage demands on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The US government is now making the protection of its databases comprehensively on the test level.
As a special officer, the Vice Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Actions, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House informed.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which had been needed after the release of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government also announced that they should be in danger by the Wikileaks publication of the security of dissidents and the most active.
"We have done everything to contact them," said Foreign Office speaker Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them when necessary."
The ice University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice conditors are being prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest accession and visitors from all over the world.
Where's all the ice from?
From the Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German a little old age of the ice conditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaker art.
The Gelataio picks the ice cream with a spacht from the cooling plate, stretches it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice is not coming by the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice university has established the manufacturer of ice machinery in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machinery will meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest accession and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice and internships in the home-own ice tiles.
Some of them dream in the Midlife crisis of a new career, others simply dare to the smooth ice of their vague lookings.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to do something own after years in a nervous job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelater Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only is good taste, but also the silent merit and the good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the cream of the national and even Southern surgery in his training: "Italy Gelato is just the best - and then a lot of romantics are still there."
The first step to production seems very simple.
Luciano picks the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools it to four degrees.
Then he turns up a haunt on the machine and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, based on all milk ice varieties.
Immediately, the lecturer is being struck with questions: Can ice cream be produced only with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you leave your own experimental desire free?
Luciano warns about letting himself be irritated by the timing spirit.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar corn flour from the guarbone.
Of course, ice can be produced without a stabilizer, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it sacks together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the ground mass are allowed.
It's gonna be more fun with the flavourings.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn dozens of aromatized additions to you."
"But you should just try."
Either in the fruit orbit with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just at the ice cream from the white ground mass that becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder to the basis for all possible chocolate conducts.
Now the course participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additions.
The same experiment is also subjected to the fruit ice varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit pures - tasteful is not necessarily better.
Haselnus ice does not necessarily taste more nuisance if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice produces the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture lifts the taste of a Gelato properly, says Luciano.
ice production is a calculation task: if Pfirsich purse is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice.
Luciano draws out a device with which it determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winds measure the ox in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make the computer egg easier.
To make ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the machine for automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is struck creamy at the same time and cooled at low temperatures.
All automation to the Despite, small pans do not stay out.
The Brazilian Gustavo clothes himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fruit curtains when the over-dimensional stab mixer makes it out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "is it only a question of time until this happens."
Controllers in the twin light
The European Food Authority Efsa is undermined by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This accusation now presents the expert group Testbiotech, which understands itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed substantially to the Efsa test rules for gene plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, then criticised.
The Efsa regulations are, at the same time, alternate with Ilsi's position documents and thus deceive the industry's manuscript, which is actually to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech deals with an interest collision.
Thus, a high-level Efsa manager was recently without conditions or transition to the Swiss Agricultural Group Syngenta - and thus switched the pages.
The Central German Radio (MDR) has also recently revealed personal links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which has made the Environmental Office brightly hearing as well as EU Parliamentarians.
However, the Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
It is said that, as long as they are of high professional quality, they are taken back to all serious data, even those of the industry.
The experts who work for Efsa do not require that they have no contacts with the industry.
But they'd have to open it.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This is called itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobby.
In the case, independent experts like Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently authorised without any feeding testing in animals and the reaction of gene plants to environmental impacts is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize makes on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only insulated proteins but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how to find them?" asks accusing.
Angelika Hilbeck looks like that.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
As in the United States, industry is now trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who have not been confined with companies.
Critical studies would usually not be published for companies.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he was formed in Stuttgart's railway station, the Tuba on his back.
It was Demo.
It cut.
The story is known: In September the Baggers were touched and began to break a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Thirty-thousands demonstrated against S21, the milliardy deepening of the railway station.
When it came to the stop of construction, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft crude stone, remained between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a few of the bricks.
"These stones are reliquiens."
"You can't get out of here."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he saw one, he smoked for cigarettes.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the bricks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The track of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone-rich.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those who would like to get off at the abbreviation in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would melt or disappear in the deposit," he says in his office, a wooden bush that once was a guard case.
He was smuggled and threatened, he said, when in September in the newspapers, that he bought the remains of the northern wing from the canceller.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for the abbreviation.
And if it happens, then it is the most reasonable if the stones were used on.
Around 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the averages of 80 kilograms, a unit price of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a memorial, but some also in the hope of giving him back in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck charges.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, hauslebauer.
They had come from everywhere and had dragged away what could wear suitcases and trailers.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long changed to "murals" or to limitations of herbal beets.
"Especially this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Don't be the political component."
He rises in his terrain cars, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of empire.
Jura studied and stopped, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became stone dealers.
And stone lovers.
He stores 40,000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany he carries his treasures together.
He says he's the largest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
In the snow there are artificially crocheted sandstones.
"They once belonged to Dresdner Marien bridge," he says.
Elbsandstone, yellow, warm, warm.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the way through the forest.
He shows a bunch of red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruher Railway Station.
And continue.
"Beautiful Travertin."
At one time the quader belonged to the Tribüne of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
All over the snow stones and stories, Cannstatt Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, Red Granit from the Dome of Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones were cut by hand and moved with simple bottle trains and ox cars, it becomes very respectful.
"It would be a scandal if you were to screw something like that."
He's not rich, he's not rich at all.
But 14 people today are employing the stone dealer, as well as in the woods, a sculptor, a smith, a glass blossom and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the residual evaluator.
He's gonna have to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save.
Talent struggle for high potentials
There's rainy Andrang on the buffet.
16 students are pressing about salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the machinery and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they're supposed to know together with VW developers about the car of the future - and all alongside Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies are now in the near fight and, like VW, put on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the hearing halls before they come to the labour market and be converted by others.
And because the universities do not publish a statement on the performance of their students, they try to watch and bind the extraordinary talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group throws around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ball scratches, rubber berries and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig carries the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come in contact with the industry and collect experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, approach interesting candidates, and consider who would be in question as employees."
Such cooperations, as Selle says, are not unusual.
It's new to be so offensive to the students.
"Sometimes the focus was on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to choose their employees from a large number of candidates.
Especially they need to pay for themselves, particularly for highly skilled workers.
Particularly graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiation position.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gaps will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
For the economic audit and consultancy company KPMG, Roman Dykta is going to the talent hunt.
He organizes excited recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern snitzel hunting, where the participants must find their way on the basis of GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the USA the next year.
In addition, the participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to take a decision in two selection rounds in front of them.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many candidates flee to the USA.
At the hawn and stack around the high potentials at the universities, the protectives are growing, according to Dykta.
"We want to get rid of the mass with the race."
"Only a simple sailing session was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the invoice seems to be going up.
"Today we have contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are standing shortly before their conclusion and want to apply with us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct bulk on the campus, small and medium-sized companies are also very classic at professional measurements on the pirsch.
"We're trying to reach graduates on specialized measurements."
"Etwa on the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, personnel director of solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the childhood problem.
Currently, 35 jobs are issued on the company website.
"It's just very hard to occupy vacant positions."
"This costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that we can do practices or write their diploma work."
Dear advertising operations are not charged with the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to advertise with other advantages for itself: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This can't offer a big group often," says staff director Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good rising opportunities are further crucial factors.
Solarworld was awarded the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual top list of German employers.
To this end, employees will ask how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and look at the framework conditions for employees.
Staff director Stübe also hopes for the job seekers from the placement.
"I think that applicants are particularly looking at external reviews about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build up a good reputation as employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers on more authenticity.
And that means, according to warler, mostly internal measures.
"The best way to make himself attractive as an employer leads over your own employees," he says.
In the industry yeargon, the internal employee branding, i.e. employer's trademark formation, is called within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you handle his people well and identify them with the company, they would only be advertised to friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"This is like a game with bande," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Before the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A prohibition has been imposed by the government in Washington - and thus finally revoke its previous plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains forbidden.
This was announced by Minister of Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The explosion of the drill platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April is triggered by the strict ban to apply for at least the next five years.
Before the disaster that eleven workers cost life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico on pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters therefore want to reduce the US dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear responsibility for the devastating oil fever in the Gulf have not been finally clarified until now.
In the centre of criticism, the British energy group is BP, which is faced with billions of requirements.
An Obamas Commission of Inquiry is to present its results in December.
In October, Minister of Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drill stop on the explosion.
Afterwards, several oil companies had immediately made applications for new drilling projects.
With stronger controls and more stringent safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been in charge of numerous claims of corruption, is being reformed fundamentally.
In parallel, Obama announced to close lucrative tax lubricators for the oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower due to a more stringent regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the largest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consultant BDO – before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains of the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what will change exactly with the regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be deferred to further growth.
Ogoniland is burned off
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of raw oil run out have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live with theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't stop," the eco-activist calmlys the journalists: "You'll still get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to illuminate a boy to the chest in the water with his surrounding sleeves: In the rainbow-coloured water gloss the scene is almost beautiful.
That under the surface of brown raw oil sweat can not be seen.
Earlier she collected shrimps here, tells Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty river.
Meanwhile, the slow flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, a chestened pipeline made a huge amount of raw oil into the huge moisture area.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to rest six hours to get into fish-bearing waters: Ogoniland located in the heart of the Niger delta is considered one of the worst ruined regions in the world.
On the ride through the mangrove swamps passing through rivers, the whole extent of destruction becomes obvious.
Instead of light water, the motorboat burrows up brown brews, who dives his hand into the water, extracts oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees, like black lacritical rods, are out of the ground, sadly let individual palms hang their wools.
Bird swarms, as they are otherwise common in moisture areas, are forgotten: As soon as the outer board is swept, the former paradise is spreading in the like a gas station, which is rising.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari window, "We live in constant danger to health."
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The settlement area of Ogoni has been a battlefield that has been fought for decades: Here, more than 60 years ago, the first explosives from Europe, organised here in the 1980s with the later author Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to set up its production because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Still today, the company has refused to return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped from the whole Delta region of the three-fold size of Switzerland with over 5000 drill sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines every day, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, too unstable is the situation of the group.
All a few hundred meters of stealing sets such as bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian trees" are called the heads of the drill holes much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded into the Mark.
Once again, a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of raw oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres have been flown into the delta's ecosystem in 50 years, according to experts estimates: year by year, the amount of oil, as they came into the sea 21 years ago at the Havarie of the Supertanker "Exxon Valdez" before Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Anyone who is responsible for the persistent eco-GAU is controversial.
While the Shell Group is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution of sabotage and the organised oil steal, environmental protectors see drilling heads and leak pipelines as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell set much lower safety standards than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner presented to the Group in 2008: The rate of defects on the lines alone is "a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks out of the distance like a left, oil-smalled workshop under the open sky, the mangroves appear: they are split and oil-smalled up to the neck.
Among one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, are partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flakes: an illegal small refinery.
In the Fass, the raw oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, petrol is pushing through the pipes into the pot, later dripping out at the end of the kerosin line and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel à 300 litres daily: "That brings us 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The Deltabe residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low diesel price with almost 40 euro cents per litre can still be lowered by the illegal cookers, because their raw material is for nothing.
It comes from "Bunkerern" who tackle the pipeline network across Ogoniland: according to experts in the entire Nigerdelta, at least 16 million litres of raw oil per day are lost in this way.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally depleted: the lion's share fills organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, in tankers and swallows it on the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is rather debted to the reversal of the population or the lax production method, considers the activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and they would not have destroyed the fishermen's life base so thoroughly, there would not be sabotages or theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell was so destroyed that only a deduction of the group could be questioned: "There may be other nationalities such as the Chinese."
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"High time for you to disappear," says the muscular oil man.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil spoilers are caught by the special unit of the forces, they are not threatened to arrest, but maybe a painful lubrication.
Also, the soldiers who are mainly from the state yard want to benefit from the raw material, like all Nigerians.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every respect," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction errors in A380 drives
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error in the investigation of an emergency machine that could lead to a "casstropical driver failure".
The Qantas flight line now wants to complain to the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the not landed Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November seemed to have known much more happiness than so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority has found a major security problem in the engines of some A380 machines in their investigations - and now warns about a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, he could produce tiredness and lecks, it was said in a opinion published on Thursday by the Authority ADB.
This could have resulted in "a catastrophic driver failure."
In 20 aircraft of the A380 series, power plants produced by Rolls-Royce were affected.
There is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It granted a appeal to an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing him to take further legal measures against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said that his airline would demand damage for the incident at the beginning of November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had been dissolved and the drag surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce expressed an oil burn as a cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines must now be exchanged worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced to carry out further safety tests to the Superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The safety problem has been considered sufficiently important in order to inform all the persons concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had held its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
The airhansa switched the engine in an A380 precautionary measure.
The double-story flyer is the world's largest passenger aircraft.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Overnight snow fell almost throughout the country.
Chaos, trains and flights are in many streets.
In car accidents, at least three people died.
Winter frosts Germany: At ice temperatures, almost all the Republic is cut to Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east there are partly 15 centimeter thick snow covers.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was permanently used, but was not finished with the constantly revising snow.
In addition, heavy winds fought over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) is expected at the Baltic Sea Coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning on storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal stand.
In Saxony, snow eruptions on the highways and federal roads led to major problems.
According to the weather central meteomedia, in Saxony Switzerland, alarm level was violett - the highest level at all.
Partly, there fell 30 centimeters of nozzle, fresh and strong winds caused deviations.
There were several trucks and cars in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to steady traffic and barrier.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, collapsed trees on the rails or destroyed upper lines and sways are the main problems.
In Saxony, distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be suspended.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, a ICE to Munich had to stop his journey.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemen and rescue helmets with wool covers, foods and drinks in the train.
Snow winds fought over the streets.
In large German airports, snowwinds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokesman of the flight information centre, a number of cancellations have already been reported.
According to a fraport speaker in Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been deleted.
Winter service is permanent.
Although few of the passengers at the airport are only stranded, almost 400 bunk beds are still available for them.
On many streets there were accidents on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver came to life at the collapse with a train on a train crossing in Eastholstein.
The driver was easily injured.
Near Nuremberg, because of snow-covered streets, there was a similar accident: also here a truck was recorded on a crossroads, because the vehicle stayed.
The driver died.
In the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked until the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing her car with Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
However, a good news has the meteorologists: although the snow will still be loose and pulvery and that is why it will already turn up with light bows.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is plagued by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - orthodox up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its true sign: According to a newspaper report, the money house buyers are looking for the two office towers at their Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros, the property could bring in.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters nice: The twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernised; the bankers have now been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group seems to want to pick up the cost of renovation again - and look for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes in appeal to a spokesman.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it is more meaningful to own or sell real estate itself and then to rent back," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution has thus resigned its company's seat after a short time.
The Bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a home-owned fund and subsequently renovated intimately.
The energetic reconstruction has swallowed the data according to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to industry experts, the value of the newspaper's towers now renamed "Greentowers" is estimated at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, are still open at present, said the speaker.
Thousands mourn for dead boyfriend
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand thought of the shedded miners who were declared dead after several explosions.
Still, the bodies could not be secured because the safety situation in the disaster shaft is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth, there was a severe explosion.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were dispatched under days.
A sin had been dropped into the calamity shaft but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to decrease for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no more chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies couldn't be protected until now.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial celebration.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island at a radiant sunshine.
They stayed for two minutes.
In honor of the scattered miners, 29 tables were placed on which helmets, lamps and the names of the comrades were seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surf boards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags wounded to half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners "from the depths of the earth" would come back to the surface, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the Memorial celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son, as long as he did not see his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was shed in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial celebration.
At the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origins were also disposed of.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire inside the coal mine on the Southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been diminished, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, said police president Gary Knowles about journalists.
Hell, warriors!
Does Plater fit the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn, with his fighter epos "Walhalla Rising", re-extracts old genre boundaries.
What audience could the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A prisoner Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his peinigers and with almost superhuman forces embraces his opponents - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rabiate killing methods and his enemies already rides the darmes from the living body when he has bad mood.
On the other hand, one eye says, as it is actually called, the whole film by no word, and also the other figures can be zipped up to one or two sentences or a few painful death shouts.
Otherwise, it is swayed and swelled in the cruelly beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which offers the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideally for adult cineasts with interest in existingism and very quiet camera trips.
Beautiful if a movie has several target groups, only harm if they exclude each other.
Regisseur Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" but refuses to make his works with a little more humor accessible to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the arthouse.
Most of the artistic cinema friends are supposed to be disturbed by the sprinkling brain mass and the barriers around.
The action fans die at the latest before long periods of time when an eye breaks up to Jerusalem for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries by ship and holds an eternity in fleet and fog before the team seems to arrive in America and continues to sweat there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a shame because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade, a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hidden, which deserves some attention.
In this film it is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film-made fever room.
And from it there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn scarcely gives him a moment of relaxation and snouts him with his ice-like pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack very slowly to the throat, but especially with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blessed boy who is faithful to one eye keeps something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of the one-eyed hero whose motifs are never explained, but who becomes a warrior for enemies and temporarily allies from hell sometime, perhaps as an ambassador of the Devil himself.
He means corruption, but maybe only for those who have been corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is a ridiculous film that you can hate and admire, for anger, uprising and amazement.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new references to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position to do so - nor does it permit controls.
At midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighters attack a mysterious, worm-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor, which Syria has supposedly built with the help of North Korea in the quader, hidden in a valley that departs from the current.
According to a lettering of the US foreign secret service CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearest town el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, however, technology from the fifteens is hardly sufficient.
The CIA presented a video presentation with unscharved satellite images.
By computer animation, she embraced where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before destruction, which was a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon Atomic Centre.
In addition, she presented photos that show the building out of the vicinity or even the interior.
The reactor had been held shortly before the commissioning, it was said but had not yet been fitted with burning sticks.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is barely more known than then, yes, the puzzles became more and greater in time.
The former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria built an reactor in el-Kibar but hardly saw evidence that there was an active nuclear weapon program in the country.
Some secret ministers in Europe prefer to be more careful and speak only of a "predictable reactor", even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how sure he was to have a reactor in front of himself, a high UN diplomat in summer answered only lapidar, which IAEA has "please of material to ask questions".
The shelter of the alleged "unused military building" made the Syrians almost by side and planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of Uran, which had been produced by people.
In addition, IAEA received commercial suppliers from a Member State to satellite images directly after the attack that should be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings cannot be obtained on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always regretted having never operated a secret nuclear program or built an reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.
However, after the analysis of the particles, IAEA rejected that as unlikely.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss it - as did the satellite images.
In addition, it refuses the controllers a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the buried building.
But Israel also silences.
"We will never comment," recently confirmed the official position of the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in the time of the attack.
Thus, since June 2008, the investigation of the case has been uncovered and "developed into a serious problem of credibility for the Authority," as a high Western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna is admitted - a serious violation of the nuclear arms blocking agreement in the space over which the IAEA is guarding.
As a key to progress in the information, IAEA seems to see three other facilities to be "in functional connection" with the suspected reactor - and still exist differently than that.
The inspectors have not so far revealed what plants are, what function they have or what they appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are called Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah at the IAEA internally, departed from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and found a building complex on satellite images at Masyaf, most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this reason, Syria refuses access to the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the US to spoil military facilities.
Because the nuclear electrons had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the US secret services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photographs, that between the three places and the quader on the Euphrat material was transported and transported.
A high western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there are "no indications on sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come and where the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated, there are at least plausible suspicions on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether ruins, which could mountain valuable traces, have been stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads were disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the shoe has stayed.
The only few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, the salt mine al-Tibni, which Syria has examined in 1998 as a warehouse for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely to be the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently contacted her in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria was doing earthwork in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be coincidence, but has hardly contributed to clearing the suspicion.
In addition, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only the effort shows the importance of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If western diplomats in Vienna were still a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter did not have a high urgency, e.g. U.S. messenger Glyn Davies has been playing so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the worst means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA-Chef Yukiya Amano, who should suggest these inspections, has already spoken of "a option for which I am open in the future," but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs a majority in the Governor's Council of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than calling for escalation.
On the other hand, how a diplomat considers: "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still unnamed regime in summer, there are troubles.
The script has written herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
A lot more you don't know about it, but that's enough for trouble.
The rumour, the woman, a Muslim woman, is in love during the Yugoslav war in her Serbian rapist.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, whereby some of Sarajevo's planned turning days were moved to Hungary in the short term.
In the meantime, the film has been rotated in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female victims of war wrote about UNHCR refugee aid to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie himself ambassador of the UN refugee aid.
She is not diplomatic - she has offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not existed, and Jolies' attitude toward the victims has betrayed her enough about the script.
According to its organization, the UN refugee aid has recommended to release Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given her screening book, has, after a few hin and Her, given a rotation permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author himself regrets that she does not follow political intentions with her film, have worked with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the sides involved.
However, in the content it remains vague.
So another synopsis of the film in the network, which sounds quite differently: The lovers already knew in it before the outbreak of war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim woman, are dragged into a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different from the variant "An rape victim falls in torture servant".
That Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, as Jolie said, was "unfair and based on error information".
Now you may only be able to give peace to the hackers of Hollywood: by putting the script illegally into the network, as many of them before.
Nothing like gone here.
That evening, it finally runs right around for the Irish.
No trace of distress.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans shouted for joy at cracking loud music, they stabbed with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the Southern Ireland cork is trembled because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer becher - and meet.
"Bierpong" calls itself the bizarre spectacle to win, there are 500 euros of victory plus tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this shrilled drinking game and the reluctant informatist, which doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself to distract himself from the boring question what will bring the future.
On his plan there is no fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct application talks in January in New Zealand.
"I have a multitude of feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I don't have any work there."
After all, his girlfriend already waited in Auckland for him - "she had tricked her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of Tanner's three brothers have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: Like the tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100.000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute of ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015 they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of immigration similar to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upturn that brought great prosperity to the Irish, trips are now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly inconscientious to the young, well-trained Irish, for which it was only going up to date.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the tree years.
Everyone was needed, there was plenty of money.
But in the meantime there are three of ten women and men under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times, there are readers of young immigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the Bach in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but whoever can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one please turns out the light."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future because the government only operates eyewhey and does not offer the young people any more prospects for the future.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her communes hang from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to migrate itself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to put the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a round-round service on work abroad.
"For professional beginners, work abroad is a great opportunity to make the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfer in Australia and snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galaxy service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has been aware of how it feels elsewhere.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are just moving up a fashion house.
In January it goes on to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
His homeland is still rarely seen by O'Donovan, because he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when he first walks over the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as never more."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept gardens, parking large, expensive cars in the entrances.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit financed.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could be wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea after and says, "I have no children I have to feed through and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from new."
The construction engineer doesn't like the wrath he's hearing at this time.
"Nobody has to hunger - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was here on the island in earlier times," he says.
"For a while to work abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen – perhaps we feel only as Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, very easy."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Open the future and just see how it runs with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London he has already been behind, and why should it not run well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
One thing, however, is still there that concerns him in these days: the celebration to his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could erase into a life-being party.
"Don't stay too many emotions," he says and drinks a big swallow of his beer.
"Of course, that sounds scaring."
"Let's call it a ride party, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democrat Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a major problem than unemployment.
Brazil's influence is greater in many parts of the region than the United States.
The Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries, was published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly visible in this year's survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong breakdown last year, such a trend is evident.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populated countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (see diagram 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents said that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, as are as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of its government. Both values correspond to that of the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This also continued during the World Economic Crisis may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession phase and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(Laut reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week in 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America has only increased slightly and has fallen by 32% this year again.)
But from country to country there are strong mood differences (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the separate President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects in a widespread progressive thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violence has increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the beginning of the survey, many respondents in Latin America have seen a greater problem in their country than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
Approximately 31% say that they themselves or a family member have been victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of the respondents overregionally indicated that the private economy is indispensable for development, in 2007 there were 56% (see diagram 6).
Approximately 58% explained that only the market economy can make progress to its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have retained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left President, Hugo Chávez, states many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
On the other hand, in Mexico and most countries of Central America, the most influential country is seen in the USA, taking this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A Election Drop
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28th.
But the facts exceeded the fears of the Electors who rushed to help the turbulent country.
Overcrowded urns, several votes delivered, electoral licenses in the Rinnstein, destroyed electoral locations and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Election locations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, struck around looking for a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen candidates of presidency, including some suspected top riders, demanded the cancellation of election results due to a alleged fraud.
There were partially violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the choice "as quite good in many interests".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "this irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly obliged to the unpopular separate president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected string choice is reserved for January.
There is still hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invaluation complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no consent to the voters, explains from the electorate to the winner of the vote, this could lead to problems.
Due to cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims are still living in tents, a small participation was feared.
On the day of election, many Haitians were prevented by a lack of organization in the voting.
Shortly before the beginning of the election, about 250,000 instructions needed for choice were not yet distributed.
It's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government an important step in rebuilding haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Homely in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, which drives up their popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since their election in 2007.
However, whether you will help you to re-elect the next year, it depends on whether Cristina Fernández is more promising than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who, even after his wife's choice of economic policy, set up budgetary plans that did not take full account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President-in-Office to spend the extra revenue according to his own gooddoing.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in the convention last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further disruptions.
Some regime critics from the governing peronists were behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian faced another and others denied the government of bribery), the convention did not succeed in adopting the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the next year, making it even more opportunity for the President to spend money on its own.
The economy is running hot: it will probably grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate, for example, is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage requirements for trade unions - are worth almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crisis, declared growth and poverty fighting for its main goals and not the reduction in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, shakened the private sector and cleaned the National Institute of Statistics and Volkszähling INDEC, which then enjoyed official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a moderate way?
She called on the private economy and trade union leaders to talk.
According to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% in the next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth gap by a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to join Argentina financially again to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government met an agreement with securities owners who had rejected the country's former debt in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to push on an agreement with the creditors from the Paris Club to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
However, last month, Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in creating a new national consumer price index. It looks as if this was the first step to clean up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be political after the end of her term of office even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, most of which has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holiday in March, the wave of sympathy that has been encountered will have been degraded.
If she wants to make another choice, she must decide if she is silent and silent to raise many political decisions of her husband.
Bad applause for China
Taiwan's voter slowly approaches a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan say about his great brother beyond the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all electorate to choose in the five districts of Mayor and City Councils. This is evaluated as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Ma itself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese native country for the first time since 1949.
Ma did the test, but only scarce.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports greater independence in Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In the case of a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils along with the KMT.
During the election there were the usual incidents in Taiwan such as truck convoy with Krawallmachers, flag-swinging mass conversions and only slightly clothed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT held a speech on the eve of the election on a KMT candidate,
when a man shot him in the face of the crowd. Line was wounded and a surrounding spectator was killed.
Bizarrweiser isn't clear whether the Protector would kill Line or join a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the choice and put the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT gave more voices.
Perhaps China was the largest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland have not been discussed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their factual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to focus on its relations with the Government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also avoids shaking the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new consciousness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive.
On the other hand, Ma wants to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese people support its China policy.
The Government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives to the Community.
China immediately sent an entrepreneur to Taipeh to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but the most important first.
It prefers to wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now re-invented.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he committed for absolute independence.
But under Tai's rainship a new generation of local politicians developed and the DPP fights for the votes of professionals and youth.
Tsai found great consent as presidential candidate of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea smith as a contact point between the DPP and China. However, this requires prejudice-free discussions.
Tsai publicly explained that their party offered a "trusted alternative" to Mas pre-swift approach to China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to stand on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged Pragmatian Su to abandon the presidency candidateship.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is difficult to choose their possible candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election fight without it.
The main reasons for his infamousness seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing grace between poor and rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will transform his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports reconciliation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there's no more back."
Grammy nominations: The Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
If you arrive at a president's request, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to take place at the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize Awards. Now the 26-year-old Jazz Bassistin and singer were overwhelmingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star since her album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the Jazz scene, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules, after which an artist may have published the album with which he was known in the wide public, at least three albums.
Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her vocal voice and a good sense for pop, radio and Latin Music, you can compare Spalding quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings comes nearest.
The album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the instrumental alben category. This lover of the critics experienced a giant success.
Iyers' competitors include "Moody 4B" of the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where, otherwise, albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The secret societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue was well deserved in the category of the Great Group. He therefore responds to the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in the classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53th Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestras with five voices and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectical orchestra, with three voices.
Among the nominates with connections to Southern California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and launched in 2009 at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
This year five artists were nominated in the category of classical producers - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums, Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concert Building Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" are played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, Bergs "Lulu of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chor of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy were nominated.
Pärt's symphony No. 4 was launched and recorded on 4 January in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The title "Los Angeles" has about 30 minutes and is the former Mikhail Chodorkowski, who sits in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concert" received a nomination in the instrumentalsolo category with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestra advertisement for recording the works of Strawinski with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumentalists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violin Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Precision and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic-Crossover, the soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for their recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins consent from the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Criticians proposed the project to promote terrorism as well as traffic.
However, according to a statement from the Commission from Wednesday evening, the new religious center meets local provisions and will be an aesthetic view.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, this makes me proud."
"It shows that justice is ruled."
"There are only few opponents," he added.
"You're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The session began at 18:00, and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost to midnight, with the votes on both sides were quite equally distributed according to press enquiry.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," said a comment.
"It is another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in sand."
"American's at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terror attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violence.
His municipality with about 135 families has lived peacefully for years in Riverside County. But they wished a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filtering facilities.
The new 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style is supposed to have two minarettes and become about 13m high.
It is intended to be built on about 17.500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opposites can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbe could enable new forms of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterial type that can live from Arsen, among other things, opens new opportunities for new life forms on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements that have been considered so far as necessary.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to wake either phosphorus or arsens."
"This makes it a very special thing, although it is almost a kind of 'friend' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies from Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as the scientists found, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake continues to grow even if it replaces phosphorus with arsens.
"You wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, says Anbar.
The study relates to microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could act from the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms in other planetary systems can initiate biochemical processes using other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA astrobiological Institute, which led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
Since Arsen and phosphorus were chemically similar, she assumed that microbes who are both exposed may replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mostly based on the fact that it is chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so big that Arsen works differently than phosphorus. It comes into our biochemical system, where it almost smashs everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exhibited the Bacterium GFAJ-1 of an rising arse concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can survive in arsens, it shows that an arsen-based life form can naturally occur, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsen is more frequent.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsens is not new, but there has not yet been a working example.
Arsen was more frequent in the early years of earth, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life can also have developed differently than in the early era," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by the NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authority.
Stainless Steeled Exhibition Hall found in Compton
According to Los Angeles County Sheriffs, the remaining two of the four exhibition schools stolen before a Bellflower motel were found.
The four exhibition schools – two acitas and two pembroke Welsh Corgis – disappeared on Tuesday when unknown to the 2006 Chevrolet Express fan, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 nights, said the authorities' statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two were discovered on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well up," says Whitmore.
"You're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legal owners."
Whitmore did not make accurate information about the dog's location nor about the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say to this," explains Whitmore.
"We follow some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs in a district animal home in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Representatives of the Sheriff found the supplier car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old rüde, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog, were unrestrained according to the public statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners on the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city, because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times reported on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dogsaw to dogsaw.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their suppliers in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer hub, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with them in their motel room.
The thick acitas and Corgis remained in the supply car because it was cooler there.
They let the window open a split wide so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car on Tuesday at 6:00 as stolen.
Peek promised anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis a finder reward. The animals were implanted for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet known whether a finder pay is paid.
The lion rebreaks after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a new-York bankruptor orfizielly blessed the "prepared" creditor plan to cut off the debts of $5 billion and to set the 86-year-old entertainment company the way for new films and television shows.
According to the Thursday statements, the plan meets the requirements of the US Concurrence Law, so that the reboot of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglas Entertainment, will no longer be in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the slightly speculated studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually takes effect only if JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond of $500 million for the financing of the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself incurs $75 million, leads the company. Financing is expected to stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with a contract to the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company's management, which fought with interest payments of $300 million/year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, the Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring experts, known by his activities at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve the financial care of MGMs and pay out the more than 140 fans of the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In spring this year everything began from the front when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 monthly for the management of the company, receives a "competitive bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created a yearly plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films for "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which should be created under the directorship of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried a fusion of the studio with Lion Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can take a significant hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jumping rods or about 48 doses of Play-Doh.
But you can clean up your gift budget.
Recently I visited three electronic toys under $80 – a Wal mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moores' law had entered into force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, a broader offer is found on the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button cells-operated toys come to the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plumbing figures, as large as sea swine that sing a note when you press on their belly.
Pressing one time corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several singers sing in harmony.
Attention: If you have started pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of Elmo live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplay games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel scarnier feet with wheel blocking, it controls the Moon Wall.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, your parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Play School, $40, for children from 3), with a whole lot of questionnaires that can be a car to a lesson, with a better exchanger with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty table. However, the games included are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for the games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photographs can also be viewed on it.
Too good, there is still Scrabble Flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a string wooden box and have a own LED screen.
The game is about aggregating the blocks in words before the time expires. It is great for an improvised booktabier competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in the Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
This can be a roller shoe or a puffle pet.
The latest head cell-operated microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not greater than the head of your tooth brush.
The beetle moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a foolish garden from monasteries.
And he's gonna stop some things.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China Become a gentler
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a urban place, checked his nervous submissions and gave orders with military authority and deflected voice.
He wanted that his female members of the Chengguan - China's sturdy guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary races and their hungry to violence - impress the viewers.
"Look up!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered them, "How lovely girls are."
Four girls, barely grown out of the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers were steamed.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight row.
Four decent hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loops.
"They look like an average for me," Mr. Tang notes slightly.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new candidates must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low stars: In 2009, 50 officials circulated an uncorrectly established imbisscar and stared the operator until it packed in after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a district of Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police straps. They have been specially selected because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the rough police a softer, feminine aspect.
But, unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are allowed to implement urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008 officials in the province of Hubei killed a spectator when he filmed her with his cell phone, how they hit a protest against a dump.
Last year a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be spoiled without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injury after a hand quantity with five officials.
An anti-violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China when attacking street dealers.
"Chengguan fears the government," said the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy on tactics.
The newspaper demanded "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics are the present approach for clearly inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women should have real tasks or only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to job display, women from 18 to 22 years of age were sought with good figures and "harmonious facets".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment ratio ends with the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too hard physically.
"The most important is their image," said an unnamed district officer at the quasi government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job, first depends on their outer appearance, such as size, weight, facets, etc."
Then come Temperament and "inner qualities".
"Weeful Chengguan are like flower vases," he said and added, "but they also have other obligations."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the City Administration of the District, does not wish to comply with this description;
However, admitted that in China, size standards in job displays for both sex are not unusual.
The same applies to uniform facets.
Whether this is a good look, it is controversy in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disadvantages do not need to apply.
"We can't use any lame or buckligens here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, patroled on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple bags and a well shaped mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that so much value is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look out in this uniform sexy?" she asks with ironic views.
Her colleague commented with the Grübchen, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude, since they have more ambitious career plans than simply shaken merchandise through the gases to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip covers about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many bread and towel dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before they are hunted.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have already said this so often," explains Mrs. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his cakes attached on a bicycle car.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than effortful.
"It's almost the same day," explains Huang Jing, 20 who studys sales in leisure time.
"All routine."
One reason is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the dealers, such as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male officers.
This is intended to protect them from public contradictions that are often exposed to officials in China.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, were renowned after the rumors of the rumors of Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured during the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown down or burned in fire.
Xindu has been spared by such violence so far.
But troubles are not excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patroled this morning, gathered more than 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired in accordance with the rules on the side of the citizens rather than in a workshop.
The owner cried Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of retirement, the officials went on the way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, remained back. He turned his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes, we're going to be arbitrary."
"Sometimes, but also physically," explains Mr. Li.
"The most of the time people start with the fight."
Prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have freed Senator John Ensign from the accusations that were raised against him after his Affair with a former Elector and his attempt to provide a lobby against her husband, the lawyers of the Senator announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal warranty against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that provided for headlines across the country and put a steamer in his career, he was considered to be a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
According to Senator Ensign's office, he was "high-friended" over the judgment following the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate’s ethics committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were discontinued and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. According to your opinion, there were sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, which were released for the first time in October 2009 in New York Times, led to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electors, helped to buy lucrative orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasure master during a election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton work. According to the documents and hearings, he took over for them after Hampton's lobbying.
Since Hampton was recently still in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to take a lobbying work for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which had been closely friendly before the Affaire, was contrary to the so-called ban on the rotary door cycle.
According to the published Indians, "it seems to deal with an agreement and the violation of the rotary door statues," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specialized in the defense of clients who are in the government's vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethikan-wives said that the Ministry seemed very careful in taking political charges after a wide range of defeats persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to have the charges against the former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously frightening," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in parliamentary and government circles of the US), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr Ensign in court.
"This in principle means that high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that on Monday he received a telephone call from a prosecutor and another day in which he was told that the Ministry would not raise any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "have acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I don't think I'm going to talk details between the Ministry of Justice and me. It's just as much to say, we think we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to postpone the investigations for a separate appeal by the ethics group after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr Ensign's parents to the Hamptons against the Federal Election Act had violated.
The Election Commission said there wasn't enough evidence that the money had been something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who long supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found thanks to Mr. Ensign lobbyists' work.
An e-mail of December 2008 proves that after the company passed on as a lobbyist Mr. Hampton, Mr. Ensing's boss, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was "indoor" because of a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also awarded with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to agree on a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had stopped for lobbying.
When last year, for the first time, information about this affair came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized with his electors and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been in the fourth place in the order of the Republicans.
After many months he hadn't noticed, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he wanted a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer is the target of police research, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, said that the Senator hopes that the ethics commission will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and launch its investigations very quickly.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calls focus on Twitter
Half a dozen of them dipped into the crabs in the courtroom.
In minutes, they sent on Twitter their reports about cruel witness statements.
At the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and bed chained children in a house that was in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of having killed three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's judgment on the jury falls.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have already filed requests to courts, which indicate reasons for a appeal and which will deal with the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that through the intense reporting of the process, also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters, it had come to a "circasate atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of irritational details, so that the jury had been inadmissiblely influenced by public disarmament.
This objection could cause appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced it during this process, I believe it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Chief Defender.
The president, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, rejected the requests by decision last week by short and bündig, when he said that the new media would be "considerably controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court claims have found that reporting on famous-berated cases has raised doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States revoked the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an Easteropather from Cleveland who should have killed his wife, and said in his decision that because of the New Media there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom".
Some believe that the television series and the movie "On the Flight" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court claims that Mr Haye's conviction a half century later might follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communications paths from the court hall which were still unimaginable at the time of the case, Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be alarmed by the influence of the new media in processes persecuted by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, she is admissiblely imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes more fair.
The Twitter issue is only one of many who present the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss years and thus delay a conviction.
For example, the defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes could already have been prejudged when judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel Tatortfotos during the jurors selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their breeders, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have filled with abomination.
The defendants say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge has falsely exchanged a lawyer who had been a critic of the prosecutor and that he had unauthorised pressure on the judgment when he had made the unexorable decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments on the influence of detailed reporting on the process may be the greatest interest.
In a ruling that they submitted last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidate during the election campaign for the Governor's Office and the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media would have continuously re-established the flames of emotions over the case.
"A such day-to-day Andrang of the mediapieces, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "wasn't yet experienced in New Haven and perhaps even country-wide."
Your focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more eminent than reports that are more slowly refunded was a technically opposed view that impairs the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts would often face the argument, social and technical changes need adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers strengthen this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard was withdrawn due to the reporting and made it clear that the New Media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "representes Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign on swamps and negatives this week, little courtesy has broken out in Washington.
Is it the embrace of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the tops of the Congress did not break through the major questions that had to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions were taken.
After all what one hears, it was not a polite discussion between two different pages, nor a respect for their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party-point collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was equally civilised, despite the political differences that still exist between Members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months gives rise to mutual respect, which deters the ideological gap that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to claim that it was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise willingness, while one itself tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after another party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, as to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it is about taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are kilometers away.
Finally, the November election Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
"No question the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections raise party passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially in those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats have hardly a different choice than to find a solution."
Bush's tax reductions end at the end of the year, and no one supports this.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is expected, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favoured tax reductions for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that you can agree on these questions during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of Brooking's Insitution warns that successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session must not lead to a permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress will be arranged in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-consent is more likely, perhaps indispensable.
"After doing the things that have to be done, this short-term psychology will be turned into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is divided by many - leading the courtesy to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what happens from today to 2012 as a pre-competition, or shadow boxes, for 2012's main event," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party elections whose education was active.
How worried the Republican leaders may also be about pokering too high, they know that they have to try to reduce their promises to reduce the government's expenditure and to disregard health reform.
The first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and the increase in certain taxes, as well as the increase in the pension age and the reduction of government expenditure, are already made clear.
Deputy Chairmans Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own opinion, so much urged to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation, and they are fighting very much so that they can only get close to that number.
The largest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, since financial issues, at least today, are little space or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans at the convention.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party collisions when the Republican Obama challenges the state budget, the taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proved that despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a sackgasse as it happened in 1995, both parties must be careful about the public response.
Anyone who is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
In fact, this may be a optimistic viewpoint.
Participation and polarization today are greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see in 2010 as a pure pre-play for a far-reaching election in 2012.
This is how many Americans welcome the courtesy that is presented this week.
But on both sides it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the questions that continue to separate the two from each other.
Through-chicked US document portrays Moscow as the port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "cleptocracy" and it gives some of the bribes and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. In February, the American message in Russia reported in a memo.
Both police and the State Security Service are experiencing high protection funds so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate transactions, but also from organized criminal bands.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "Vertical of Authority" - takes its part of the money that the leader walks upwards.
The memo sent under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle to Washington was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names were edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime had been cleared.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption claims over years, and he has gained numerous blasphemy charges against such charges.
In September he explained to a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentation suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's frightening, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has resulted in surveys.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the Ambassador, individuals are called, and it is unheard that this happens through a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of Moscow's government with crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and conclude that the government is more like a cleptocrate than a government," the Memo says.
Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of the criminals / the Mafia, which is literally "dach" or protection), which extends through the police, the state security (FSB), the service supervisor (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government office.
Experts have discovered a three layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordained criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lower stage."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gamble because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues to say that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and that the police arrests small businessmen.
One source, so it is, "explained that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to get the protection of MVD and FSB (and not of organized crime), as they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as demanded as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the money is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don't pay find their business very quickly closed - due to the one or other precursor.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time he has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucratics," said Georgy Satarov, Director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's no part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of forces, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, according to the estimate, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is placed on place 154 of a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt".
The uncovering of the Memo of the American Embassy, which happened late in the evening after Moscow, will surely trigger misfall within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a falsification and responded angry to the unveiling that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and so unethical, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront with the past
In a weakly illuminated classroom with dirty and blazing walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built him to the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the slaughterer", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge's capitulation against the government, long-standing followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims public confrontation with those who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time children of former soldiers tell the history of Khmer Rouge.
And in July a community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia first sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former Chief of the renowned Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known than Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fears of the Khmer Rouge Veteranen Alnlong Vents grew, their efforts to reconciliate and re-integration into Cambodia's society.
"There is still a rejection and anxiety in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's documentation center, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For her life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were excuted or died of disease, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese fled and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the rest of the regime and his military fled to Thailand at the Cambodia border.
Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, turmoil.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok approached the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement supported by the UN led to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to go over to the government, which led to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died of a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his trial.
When their governors no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the degrading poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few of the Khmer Rouge's elitary officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng
"They are anchored in the utopic agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before leaving himself in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice builder.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also awakened anxiety here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to put Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, in court.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has little contributed to mildening the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on In Chaem, 64 years, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007 she told the Cambodia Documentation Centre representative that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening In Chaem from work on the fields to their wooden house came back on a dirty road outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the darkened grass, In Chaem, it refused to discuss their past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court invites her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, here would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had fled from the Khmer Rouge in 1878, also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspicious, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia has to dig a hole and burie the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Compensation with the Khmer times means merging the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts so that as everything can understand."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages over the Khmer Rouge.
As often as in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gain progressively influenced," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek mountains, one of the bushes leads overcrowded and with plastic waste-driven paths to a rectangle of black rubble, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile seller on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will drop a bush of mature bananas - hoping that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to keep collecting non-approval uranium
In an astonishing victory for President Obama's campaign for the worldwide protection of nuclear materials, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that one will no longer collect high-rich uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus from collecting no longer high-rich uranium and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
However, officials of the US government told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of gunable uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations" from April which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation from the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012).
"That proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is fundamentally weaponous, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at that time.
"This is our raw material... we won't make any dirty bombs from it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the US a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first start to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly radiated, says officially.
It was charged into a special move for more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal factory, say official.
The second start was decided on Monday and was carried out by the official by plane.
The US government pays $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build confidence", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, working on the Global Danger Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Advanced Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium in the year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the USA have been excited for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's disrespect for human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"To welcome the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus declare that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central topic in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections by the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners across the Spanish state territory to Guantánamo, as is shown by a telegram of the U.S.A. ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents forwarded by Wikileaks and reflects the daily newspaper "El País" (per cable). It is added that the former Deputy Governor María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish Government to be informed, "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which the aid for human rights-degrading practices was accused in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Government Secretary admitted that the Council's report "has taken Zapatero off" and reaffirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objection to the secret service flights across the Spanish state area."
"You just want to be informed," not to be "unprepared surprised," reports Aguirre by cable.
The former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "will not pay great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because they lie in the hands of the judges."
On the other hand, the prosecutor Vicente González said in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to declassify the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no burdensome or sensitive information," said the Ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to manage discreetly between governments," complains Aguirre.
During a lunch in March 2007, in which the ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Minister of Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba took part, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were insanely conscious of their independence and doing what they consider appropriate", he instructed his employees to avoid "flaming rhetoric comments to allow the tension to flee."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
"Through their general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the government of Zapatero will tolerate or deliberately ignore actions of the US that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if these expansions could have a negative impact on the US government," he stresses.
The child's murderer confessed that she complained on the Internet about the "driving" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a galicic way"
Monthica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she leads from small to small, she holds contact with a kiss and at least one girlfriend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The notifications are from 2008.
To understand these, you need to know their love life, which the ABC daily newspaper reconstructs on the basis of witness statements from their family members.
In 1998, the 30-year-old galician woman took up a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
She kept a year.
Shortly after she resolved her relationship, she became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his former never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Soon she entered a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to take care of the labour market, the young man stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But the contents of their news can be concluded that their love relationship broke and separated them.
In March 2008, she is on Menorca alone and writes: "Alberto is very strange and sad because I came to work."
"When I told him that, he found it good, but now, of course, he realized what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, do and let him do what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send the boy to you."
She complains, "If he doesn't like letting the boy with my mother, I'll get him when I'm back."
In May she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm going to stay there only until 19, because I have to imagine a work on the 20th day if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she's taking her firstborn when everything's gonna be all right.
"He will be with the one he must be, that is, with me. Never in life I will leave him again with someone except with my mother," a doubtful intention when considering their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
When she writes it, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was supposedly murdered on the 10th.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand he's with me and the place likes him a little, but on the other hand he must go to school every day."
She speaks of a move to Mallorca.
"This is where he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenses for the baby girl."
On 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant cushion of César who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. If he wants to, he finds me such a shit."
On the 30th again, "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
By Víctor, their current partner, there is one: "He's shooting me money."
On the Internet, in Anime and Mangablogs, there are communications from her.
She even had a own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer."
"Terror a la gallega (transscription)".
The last man who lived with her, an afflicted hunting overseer, explains having conscience bites because he feels guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monthica was transferred to the Province Prison of Palma yesterday from the Centre for Tribunal to Menorca.
The obliged defendant, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the expiry of the matter, "and she did not have the intention to harm the little one."
However, beforewards, she had been able to drown César in the bathtub and stain his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats at the Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
According to the important vote and honourable Member in the last regional elections, the PP has already preferred to the parliamentary elections, or not, because their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party has reached in these elections is usually twice as high as the number of votes in the elections in Catalonia.
The Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes at the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this number was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On last Sunday, the PPC achieved 384.091 votes.
If this ascending tendency - the result of the redirection of the PSC's vote and the electoral bond of the PP - should continue, the analytics of the PP predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congress members in the parliamentary elections, while also CiU would gain four (here is now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (from 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - currently having three - while ICV holds its Members or could win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections in May 2011. Also then the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to end the socialist domination in four province capitals and with its majority in Barcelona's City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will be able to lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists do not reach a majority or retreat to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican Debakel, it is not deviant that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona municipal council, in which it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP gained an increase in their vote in the four capitals of the province and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to play the main role in Tarragona's revolt. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
And Lérida lies the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, àngel Ros, enjoys good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to record a significant increase.
At present, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell concerned Al Qaida thousands of passports
Apart from the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanians and Nigerians arrested by the police officers of Barcelona's secret service formed the Shihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "moving to liberate Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the attacks in Bombay, which demanded 106 dead in 2008.
The Spanish interior minister confesses these investigations to a great extent that he assures that the "operation Campai" has been "swallowed" by Al Qaidas' counterfeiting device worldwide and "so their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy was composed Al Qaida, so that their "fighters" could unfairly cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The revealed cell is not the only one of the Djihadist network active in Europe. Therefore, except for the Thai investigators, other European police units have also contributed to research. It is not excluded that in the EU's area, it will come to similar attacks as it was carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanian Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand where the Pakistan Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai countries Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok from the cell settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - especially tourists stole passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents on the names of men aged 25 to 45 have been issued and have to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
In research circles, it is underlined that no connections between those arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay were found, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the passengers stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the Attendance of Catalonia had been sent from a cash transfer company several thousand dollars, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" which put an end to the life of 106 people.
The police have confiscated a comprehensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present Artur Mas personally their conditions to support his prerogative as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are not different from those already put in place during the election campaign, and can be summarized with the prerogative of the economic recovery and abandonment of regionalist independence advisors, such as a financial balance agreement that the regionalist leader will propose at the summit of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's Party turned with certainty to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 Members who had won her last Sunday - a number that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable. For the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is required that at least one of the opposition parties will be included in voting on his appointment of the vote.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter at the forthcoming parliamentary elections at the Congress depend on a potential entrepreneur with the PP. However, the discussions that Mas is currently conducting with the other party chiefs are about Catalonia.
As far as the president of the PPC is concerned, it calls for "all discourse relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as for an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to that of the Basque country - and which is to be subjected to a referendum to the Chief of CiU party.
Both political leaders are in common that they want to make the built-up political device of regional administration slender and abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the arrival of Mas are addressed by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Altenpflegeheim confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Old Home in Olot do not exclude that their nurse killed over eleven older people
The Responsibles of La Caritat's Old Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference, in which they revealed the damage of the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurser who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - to the facility.
Joan Sala, head of the Old Care Hospital, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the deaths), but "law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only take a social loss of reputation because it did not identify the careper's criminal acts in time, but now also pay a high compensation amount calculated by the legal representatives of the victim's family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime goes back on August 2009 and that he has been further murdered since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old care home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally studied the deceased, but the formalities due to their ages and diseases were handled by telephone.
The director of La Caritat nominated this point and stated that "remaining measures could never have been the reason for the incidents at any time."
The attorney of La Caritat added that "there would not be any indications for negligent acts of a person other than the defendant."
The "Death Angel" was already baptized last 11 murders and explained that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and killed the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, in contrast to the first crime in which he had given a mixture of different sedatives.
The director of La Caritat said that the personnel's access to the medications should be difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the calm cocktail used the nurse in six of nine committed crimes to free patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose for his first victims a less cruel death or whether he burned them out from inside by administering them bleachlauge, as he had said to have done it by three women, who he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the nurse’s statements, even as regards the number of murders that might be more likely to be. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it does not make sense to change his course of action after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say they made them available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents of justice.
Threatenings of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The euro-Peripheri countries' risk increases dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be deceived and that the euro has hardly placed on points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquide market, which, in the measure in which it recovers again, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to revert our liquidity measures, which the ECB has to make a withdrawal for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan for the purchase of State debt as they are ineffective, as well as the withdrawal of all exceptionally temporary liquidity measures. It should only be retained one week of unlimited access.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and to maintain the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the program to continue to buy bonds and provide a strengthening signal.
If the created expectations are not fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets will be reversed from yesterday and if hesitantly persists on the withdrawal of our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB session in May, when the Bank reaffirmed that the purchase of State debt documents should not be considered and the markets would then be collapsed, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed the teeth, and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot, with which she provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year national titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government government spent only 500 million on 5.28%, compared to 750 million on 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basic points in the entire curve, reflecting a perception change in the markets according to the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million short-term and possible further 15 000. There is time until February to obtain private capital or these banks are interpreted.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it did not recognise the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must receive Parliament's consent to its new budget on Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has designed its discourse with regard to the summit of Heads of State and Government moderate on 14 December. There is political unity required to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth Symphony Beethovens.
The Spanish Government President yesterday presented the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, degradation of state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job procurement measures. Measures that sound four seasons in the ears of investors like Vivaldis.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has added by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a major auction of a three-year national bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we place a strong demand that will remove all doubts about our debtability.
For Spain, the application of an aid plan would be self-offering.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed in time.
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with the Motto Caesar's wife: "Now not only counts being, but also the appearance."
Just courage, we can do that!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen, at the request of his children, fights the Association Meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the Eulen society and El Enebro, does not flourish.
David Álvarez, founder of the company group, will challenge the El Enebro company meeting, which will take place on request of five of his seven children on 16th, as he considers it "absolutely vague". His children will try to receive a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - the owner of the vineyard Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute for the control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not seem to be willing to submit to the control of El Enebro's institutions in his dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, appointed to members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders meeting of 18 January this year, which has already been registered in the trade register.
The social meeting of El Enebro, which was held by the Judge of the Commercial Court No 2 of Madrid for the 16th, triggered a new thunderfall in the family Álvarez.
The appeal of the Judge to the Assembly is the only legal way to ensure the establishment of the Society Assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "despaired means of the applicants - his five children - to recognise the unprecedented assembly by legal intentions, fraudulent acts and abuse of law," as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for fighting the congregation afterwards to explain it as "absolutely vain".
In June, the same protagonists, who were in discreet silence, have already tried to invoke a congregation on a judicial basis.
At El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of capital.
On the other hand, the founder of the service group calls for the right to use more than 51% of the capital according to family protocols.
This is the actual background of the case that the judge has to decide in the hearing on the treatment of the contested complaint for which no date has been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1, its history in this read universe is characterized by the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one gave attention to the newling and despite his steep ascending tour during the last season, in the final tracks last November, everyone set on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without trying to reduce the power of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "home weapon" which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands, and thus created a winner team, became a legend.
In reality, a powerful software for the simulation of processes that brought the German company to the market in 2007 for purposes that do not have to deal with authors.
This informatics program, known as PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and excess costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and the most famous utility vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected on the race and in the tests.
Russwurm claims that in 1992 there were an average of ten technicians working in the race stables, which were able to introduce at least three or four improvements in one season.
In Red Bull's team, 180 highly qualified young people are employed today. With powerful EDV systems, they carry out analyses and any possible changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all the components of Red Bull's race cars, except the engine for which Renault is exclusively responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality by means of advanced production plants and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that can spend a formula 1 team for its race separation in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his race cars in a 50 kilometer from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true Formula 1 - Held is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the Energy Drink manufacturer puts in the services of its participation in the race tracks, further protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their knowledge is zero.
The technologian head of the work, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago, it was possible to say that the progress in the R & D sector contributed to the victory with 50 percent and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the shares have changed. The technology represents 85 percent of the success, while the pilot contribution is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) launched his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first one of 20 shops with 80 to 100 square metres each, which the multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in multimarket operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Deputy Chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, called the rebuilt shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has worked with it for thirty years.
The North American group intends to set up 200 sales offices in Europe by 2010, of which 20 branches in Spain.
The first were devoted last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbien). Barcelona is the third business.
Mrera did not want to betray the upcoming reopenings, but did not exclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The Deputy Chairman, who is also Head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening the store is always the same. They rely on a local operator with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises this and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products to address). In Europe all shops will look like the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the store personnel.
Helena Herrero said it wasn't a franchising system and pointed out that the exclusive sales office network was intended to "optimize the customer service and advice of small and small businesses when purchasing and afterwards, even the packaging."
The Barcelona Store has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and small businesses and private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million customers 'clue'
The Managing Board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
However, it provides for a breakdown of the interest rates that banks are trying to compensate with increases in fees and loans.
Sabadell expects to catch a million private customers in three years - an existing subject.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year Guideline in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by a million private customers - 700 000 if they deduct customers who are going to lose the bank - which is the major challenge that this bank faces, because it has so far dedicated more attention to business customers than to their private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, speaking expertivity, cost reduction. The challenges the Bank faces with it will present them together with the annual final report.
Only few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has resolved all the plans of the banks worldwide.
This year, Sabadell will conclude its four-year-old optima guideline, which was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, he was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings boxes are the main target of the bank.
During a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that in 2011 a "stricky" year would be "with great range".
The manager assumes that Spain is only "slow" from the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years - basically for the survival of banks.
Even if it assumes that the war for liabilities - which penalizes the interest margins - will run, the risk surpluses that banks and savings will have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity are already paid to the price for loans as a compensation for decreasing profit margins.
"The topics of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on credits."
"We didn't rotate the coat, but the interest differences are very high," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto already issued the order to their branch network on Thursday to restrict the grant of long-term loans and increase interest differences (cf. Cinco Días, 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the state, "increasing fees," but "inside a competitive framework".
Sabadell's guiding plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporative businesses.
Not for nothing he assures that "larger companies are necessary in Spain."
"In the next year everything will change," he assures.
It emphasizes that the need for capital is currently "enormising" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will become abruttle in red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market in capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he awakens the argument of some bankers who already prophesie a new liquidity crisis.
It stresses that nothing could be circulated, but, unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing on repo transactions could be achieved and thus the crisis could be dealt with.
CECA excludes a second merger wave of the spare boxes
The CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a merger wave of savings and stressed the speed with which the industry was being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish sparkassen began, several sparkassen did not participate in the first phase, and they stayed in the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The involvement of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, rather it was adaptations."
"The largest part is finished. It may be that we have 13 or 14 instead of seventies, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all the processes."
In a breakfast organized by the Managing Directors and Manager Aragoniens (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process was "as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limited expiry, which was set in previous times, not now, under the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition of 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a historically uncomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he highlighted.
Olavarrieta said, "there would have been a number of unsuccessful opinions on the slowness of the process that revealed unity and insaneness, because "Banco de España urges us to conclude right before the end of the year."
The CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems of Europe and "maybe" around the world, adding that those who doubt this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy, we must "no worry" about the situation of financial institutions and the savings banks which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process that will be "as soon as possible".
He also reminded the Spanish banks that the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July were very good.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time lay down conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and small enterprises, regulating time-working companies or repealing the 426 euro support for unemployed unemployed people, and privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Baraja and El Prat airports and 30 percent of state lottery.
On the other hand, with the help of former government president Felipe González, the Deputy Government Secretary, Elena Salgado, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as a responsible person who has decided out the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It is premature that Merkel's position is not a mistake in public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the euro.
Germany takes a fundamental new perspective for the design of our future, which contradicts the maintaining of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the oppositions in Europe, we begin to speculate over three possible paths from the crisis in Germany.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south had to leave the euro area.
The second: the re-introduction of the German Mark - although it sounds more like Science Fiction - supported by a large number of public opinions, about 50 percent of the population.
The third parties: a change of the euro in accordance with German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budget management; punishment of the countries that transpose the requirements; possiblely, payment adjustment of some countries and the expansion of the cost of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been characterized for some time. That is why there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government moved a constitutional reform out of the sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the strife between what Germany considered necessary (strengthen tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign set the Central European country, when Merkel uttered the decision to save Greece painfully.
At that time it was strongly criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, public opinion and public opinion were absolutely against the salvation of Greece.
Finally, Merkel will be new in the last October days with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country's rescue and at the same time oblige private lenders to carry some of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as it pushed the Irish crisis and all the following.
But their proposal, even if something is lost, was adopted, and in the next few months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It all says that, even if we have to take unpopular measures, there will no longer be the old way of working the euro from this date.
In 2013, the year of birth will be a new monetary area in which the conflicting countries will be severely punished, forced to explain incapacity of payment and in this case the private sector must take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to engage in a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, increased consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness as well as positive external salaries.
The other alternative based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was quoted by Spain in tree times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not understand.
It is not only about dropping the state deficit down to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will be more quiet.
And that we will use the possibilities that are offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero did so, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) pointed out that despite the criticism of Merkel to create the hypothesis of order in his own house, it has made its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like it would change something.
Among the possibilities considered, it is not that we should leave the euro area full of collapsed with little serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulation
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to handle a sanction.
The supposedly used exclusion from two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink over whether it was an importial act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (their team had already won clearly) time and played several fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed sanction at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next stage without cards.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of the UEFA punished the trainer of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often to be found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but in this kind of sport -.
Part of the upcoming debate on the presented case is that a team of the Real Madrid football club (which presents nobleness and honor in his hymne and punished his players for similar incidents on other occasions) played the main role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added a episode more to his long history than theatral and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behaviour that is not explicitly banned by the statutes contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts represent a regular attitude.
In this case, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, a aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the counterparty players from taking an unjustified advantage from the counterteam. Nor did it.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand under wrong game or regularism, because the reversal of the rule has not been taken secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as noticeable as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited down and welcomed the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the infringers have drawn from the deliberate fouls.
Here it should be stressed that the rival was not brought into a more unfavourable situation or the advantages of the played game were heated, because the obvious result of this action was that your own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club won't have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, up to a certain degree of uncertainty, as the team could sometime divorce. Furthermore, the players receive a sanction with this approach and go into the second card cycle in which they are excreted with a card less than in the first cycle due to the accumulation of cards.
This does not make it clear whether it is really an advantage.
Finally, such practices do not contradict the sports spirit, which also includes strategic decisions, in order to benefit the highest possible benefits from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to handle sanctions (this would actually be a clear case of regulating), they wanted to choose when they were subjecting them.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the border between invention and regulatory environment is unstable, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemics came from two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of provoked rule transfer.
The damage caused by these actions to the principles of sport is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer Offensive for the customer's catch for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
This year, the dictatorship of the calendar drops a recreation of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread out. They don't want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also groups dinners in the past night, which lead to Barcelona's restaurants and leisure business. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they solve an open price to catch the customer segment that is the big mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the respondent entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
In order to make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls to one Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of 13 December, with the result of an avalanche of dinner reservations on two top days (16 and 17) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have set up group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to abandon this tradition, many workers pay them out of their own bag.
As the economy is, lowest prices are required, the chairman of the Barcelona Gaietà Farràs restaurant will confirm.
The representative of the roof association does not dare to predict how the holidays will look this month.
"The people think it's thirty times before they reserve."
"They would like to go out, but they would be strongly observing the prices," he stresses.
The business will go well with those who "provide quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and calls us to remember that customers are saving in crisis times, which is why prices are most demanded by 25 euros.
In a survey in several central restaurants, it is found that the evening of December 17 will lead the providers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be treed. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, who has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the personality of the calendar has led to preferable reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We made the impossibility possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
With AN Grup, who leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, it is not lost optimism after the revenues are bloomed again and good, although concentrated on a few days for the Christmas business.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
To the six group menus a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than price heat. It has the impression that customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and, in return, want more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you can see green sprays, so the employees will be invited again. This gives the impression that the group eating is back in the upswing.
From the roof association Fecasarm (with fusions such as the bargaining, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the Deputy Chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "lived", although the customers "slap out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebration did not go back, no matter who pays.
The Pakistan nuclear program excites great concern in the USA
Islamabad makes nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Explorations of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department was revealed by the website of Wikileaks, confirming the tremendous concerns of the Pakistan nuclear program Washington.
On the edge of the clearing and juicy details, which provide the documents on the content of the conversations and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between both countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened, but is "decreasing", and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not compiled, but their single parts are stored in order to make it difficult to devastate in a possible attack - Washington prepares sleepless nights.
The following risks include the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear plants to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumably distributing the nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people implied in the nuclear and missile programs is not only seen by the US but also by Russia as an excess and reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan has to set up strictly faithful personnel to monitor nuclear installations; because of the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more possibilities to reconstruct people who work on nuclear or missile programs," said Yuri Korolev, expert of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a discussion with his North American colleagues.
New documentation revealed by Julian Assange's web portal is that cooperation between the USA and Pakistan is lowering nuclear distribution and the increased rate in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", explains: "There is no transparency; we do not receive any answers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington to "clear the responsible" that "Pakistan's army has to stop his silent supporting terrorist groups during a visit from the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani."
Hunting for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new enthusiasms.
Interpol gives a red warning to the persecution and discovery of Assange.
All that is related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth, in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" for the "finding and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
Moreover, it is not new, it comes from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last uncovering of more than four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures the police, "when and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
The International Police Authority, based in Lyon, France, issued the arrangement at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receipt of the power by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 interpol countries are required to identify and find assange, "to capture and deliver it provisionally."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States, according to the organization's statements, consider the red warning as a free letter for a arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to stop.
Assange's lawyers, who published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the departure from Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor who was given the corresponding approval to Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Security Chief of Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is accused in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia regrets the innocence of her son - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday he gave the head of Time per Skype magazine an interview from an indefinite place. During the conversation he requested the resignation of the US State Secretary, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats to pioneer the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the US, it would have to withdraw," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who referred to the request for resignation as "small and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the sender CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high person responsible for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new documents.
The attempt by the speaker of the president Barack Obama to give less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim in these days.
The Congress Deputy Peter King, who will lead the Presidency in the National Security Committee of the House, asked the State Department to examine the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "to confiscate their funds and to track anyone who supports them or contributes."
Tom Flanagan, consultant of Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to "be murdered".
"Obama would have to turn it into a target disc and use an unmanned plane or something."
One who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was, who sent through information in the government, he is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not executed, is too mild punishment," he explained to the sender Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC with an eyedrinker to Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to vote secretly on his persistence in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to evade the thirtieth time of an internal intrusion in the rows of after the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes of the electoral ERC.
The chairman of the party is aware that his resignation threat is not sufficient to the closest of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weak as her mind itself and will not give him the same head breaks as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a eyedrinker, which would secure his position up to the next local elections.
For the first time yesterday, the more than 200 regional members of the ERC announced that they could express themselves secretly about their stays in the office.
With choosing lists, not with lifted hand.
If the Carodiists wanted to miss the president a criminal wardrobe, they could do so without fear of repressals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of splitting and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he reaffirmed that he would not feel confirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added, without specifying percentage values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod Nearly calls on the President more than only the party to make his office available. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the top organ of the conventions.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority to make retirement, they will agree with the Executive Board with an action plan from now to May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the management will be presented to the Council on 18 May.
Their intention is to apply for Puigcercós. In return, this is to promise to present the convention in the autumn of 2011, which the party's tip already considers to be a fact.
The chairman of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" damages stability and strives for every time to enable the organization to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the official Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the holder of Innovació believed it was a fact that the party president was supported "in exchange against different objectives".
He counted five of them, two of whom are in the foreground.
First of all, the "restructure" of the board so that this represents at least 90 percent of the party members, namely the involvement of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally give up the general meeting principle as a functioning way.
He thus fights a reform of the statutes that will allow the conventions to be held with chosen delegates.
From the end of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which already fought for this at the last two conventions, is occupied.
In fact, at the tremendous meeting of 2008, the party leadership was commissioned to review the general meeting principle at a convention to deal with the reformation of the statutes.
This date is still out of place, since information about the internal rest of recent years was not advisable to this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the laur, the time could have come to reopen this matter and to complete it forever.

China maintains its objectives to reduce greenhouse gases
China's representative at COP16 stated that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
During his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and convert its industry.
He argued that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals but would work on this matter together with the international community.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institutions building and pilot support.
In all aspects progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the authorities of the Federal States had cooperated with those of the Central State and the municipalities in order to achieve the energy saving targets, effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions.
In addition, he argued that some several years of plans have already been initiated or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those receiving funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy that has been introduced over the last five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and from private hands.
It also runs a provincial project for climate change, another project for the exchange of traditional bulbs through energy savings and another for weakening and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government consultant on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than would be generally accepted.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tonnes per person, while 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a total of nine percent for environmental pollution.
Similarly, it makes unprecedented progress in the field of energetic use. Energy effectiveness has been increased by 20 percent over the last five years, and it is to be done by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN said that the former panist party president had the right to contact the National Order Commission and to ask what the right to him is.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos had been right and that the former party president of the PAN had the right to contact the National Order Commission and to ask for what the right to him.
In an interview that took place before the complaint of Gabino Cué Monteagudos as Governor of the state, he explained that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision made at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to contact the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said that it was not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance to the presidential candidates had never sat on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened from the internal vote on the next 4th and 5th December, where his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a presidency for the election of the municipality, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he explained.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "does not scare us of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman that Acción Nacional would need for the next three years, so he gave the staves "to those who would decide the Council."
"I'm very unconcerned and open there. I would be proud to transfer to each of the five the office of the party chairman."
He predicted that the party's upturn at the last elections of July 4 will reflect in the next elections, although "it's not the time to think about 2012."
"Now it is about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that came from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and observe it throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and desires are put into them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of the requirements."
When he was interviewed about the criticism of PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in the context of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI members to think about the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the cabinet," he reiterated.
He believes that the holder of the federal government would like the expressions he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because there was no mouth ban and even less a censorship in this country.
Obama is engaged in Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and press on the adoption of this law," the President of the United States twittered in the popular social network.
Today, President Barack Obama supported national mobilisation to support the Dream Act - Law for the legalization of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then your senators call on and press on the adoption of this law," twittered Obama.
Its brief release contains a cyberlink on a wider document that calls for the public to contact their senatores, as the vote of the law is in the near future.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The message was distributed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all voices for each law, except the expansion of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators could affect the vote of the Dream Act - Law and other projects such as ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Regarding the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that once the tax issue was solved, a schedule could be set up for the other projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matters must be dealt with before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on it at any time and then we can plan the expiry of the rest," he said.
The Chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday, "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - Act, with which the initiative for the legalization of undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from the next Thursday, although the next week would be more probable.
The version of the Dream Act - law or the law of the American dream would legalize about 800 000 young people who moved to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, living in this country for the last five years and are enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the defenders of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, so they are dependent on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At the moment, the organisations of the predecessors of this project organise an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska said that he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans on their side, if other Democrats should decide to return to the initiative.
Among the most evolved Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans, who backed up the Dream Act in the past, are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they no longer supported it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken for the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analytics agree that the Dream Act in the Senate faces the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust to the Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used the subtitles of her question on this occasion (the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "Please bring us in trouble," the Argentine scribe was sweet to meet the audience, which was mainly composed of young people who came together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table fashioned by Marisol Shultz, at Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and then marked the Shultz as a great narrative. Luisa tells the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for to know what a "wund" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, which she does not answer, but receives instructions for the guides of her narrrative.
The infectologist leaves her convinced: "Geduld is not my strength, maybe this is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the trauma athologist who took her the breath in the middle of the passage, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalytic reveals the secret: "The wound is the really open one, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the narrative sucks enlightens and concludes that "from the wound only learned that it is really open and not exist". But it is convinced that the desire in the language and their cases is mixed.
Valentila, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented an enthusiastic narrative that he called 'Lob of Invention', and in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound, but is discovered.
With presentations to magical realism, he tells of a famous magic who touched the clouds, brought back far-drived men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turn of victory and reported by America, the great novel, which was not missing from the beginning on his own chronists, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the flood of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), spotted the premature witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with impression that even the shame came away."
However, he emphasizes, "is it the crazy and liars who imagine things best," and where reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows to which side the story belongs, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls that the 'tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the row, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIl's invitation to the round table 'The finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puertorkaner devoted their contribution to the great wound of social violence that their country falls, as well as Latin America, as the result of the fights for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, non-deliberately planned commitment," she explained after she had highlighted that literature is communication and liability that builds up between the author and the readers as with a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "this fingers of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-lived world, the intellectual habits and control of consciousness will go beyond dogmatism, and will forget, "that behind every confirmation there is a small no and behind every denial a small yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuancing: And nuancing often means to put the finger into the wound and to harass those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also to harass the mighty ones who prefer to share the world in black and white he noticed and invited to rediscover the sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Ups and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the Duell between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game there are also two different styles in relation to their respective trainers, and their encounter marked by counterparts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Ups and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept good, so this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentine has played up with the Medaille to the second champion, he is a step behind the winners, and surprisingly he has performed successive final games with the same team.
The Santistic Stratege reached the first final game as a trainer at 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the tendency in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the crucial duell, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put a retrospect again, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros ended after 210 minutes of play, but at the Elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to insert his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rivalry. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by the disaster and free himself from the evil magic to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection I give myself, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important," said the taxman, when he was asked about the lost end games.
The last final game has remained strongly in memory, he assured that he learned a lot from it: "The only teaching we can draw from it is that until the arbitrator doesn't puff the end, we can't celebrate, we're prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared with two elephers, and I think that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there's no occasion for celebration."
To know that this series could be decided by Elfmeter shooting, doesn't worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the elephant shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes because of nervousness or the intense striving to keep the title in our hands, that left us something for this end game, and we hope that it will not come to this time."
It is in Romanso power to be no longer the second champion and for the first time cost the glory that the titles bring.
The US changes the rules for receipt of a visa
The persons must introduce themselves before their discussion at the consulate at the service offices for visa applications; the costs will be reduced in such a way.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for application of a visa are changed in the United States and the Consulates' message.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves in the consulate before their discussion at the service offices for visa applications (ASC, initial letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the consulate prior to the discussion.
The new procedure has certain benefits for aspirants, including:
The total costs for the processing of the visa are reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service to which the document is handled.
The applicant shall provide only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterpart to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visa with application (including visa for time workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only wish to extend their visa do not have to have a conversation in the consulate, they must imagine only at the nearest ASC where they submit their documents and take their fingerprints.
As biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the consulate will remain there less time than before.
Those who request the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo do not have to pay the service surcharge of 26 dollars anymore.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the Fund of Outside Earth's Life
The North American Space Agency called on a press conference to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living in the world.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States announced tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of existence of alien life.
The Fund is presented at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington tomorrow at 13.00 p.m. by experts of astrobiology, which examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was called up, the NASA assured that it would introduce "a sensible finding for the search for extraterrestrial life" which caused speculations among experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it could exist in opposing environments that have been believed to be inexistent, humanlike creatures. The hypothesis was raised that they could turn into intelligent living creatures, such as humans, if their living conditions improved.
Apparently it is a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in a environment that was considered too toxic to all imaginable forms of life, as the lake is strongly arsenic.
In any way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proved that "it actually gives a different form of life, a second form of life that differs from the one we know."
The space agency, on Thursday, announced the actual scope of its fund at the press conference.
At the conference, Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturns) in the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to that of the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on the Congress, the two-party system is introduced, they complain.
The 60th period of legislation had just begun, and a block of opposition was already installed, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who represented himself as an independent one.The four questioned: the entry of the 'Two Party System' into the Chamber.
Before the introduction of the 60th legislatorial period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez von Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the organ law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties who controlled the convention.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau of the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Deputy Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties had institutionally introduced PRI and PAN with these reforms their political margin.
He argued that in the next days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, and they went out of the political will, and if they did not have it, they would again be disproportionate from both parties, which would end the opposition coalition.
"To this end I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions which do not even consider taking into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were consents with PRD, PT and Patrón and that a pluralist group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that after the convention was monopolistic, it should be "douopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should rule at the convention."
"For the beginning, this group starts with five Members and they talk to other colleagues, so that they may become more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT led to PAN and PRI in presentation that the Congress was currently transformed into a 'beute' for two.
"Before it was only one party, now they split them up to second."
Patrón Montalvo requested to respect the Members and to assign them their place to the negotiating table.
"It must not be left outside because of top decisions that are likely to be nine Members. The five who are currently viewed as divided into different groups have decided to unite in order to take our place on the negotiating table, because because of the reform carried out and agreed by the others, we are left outside and we are not agreeing with this reform."
200 000 more peso for "the supplier"
Mazatlán's city administration pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check over a little more than 200 000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
The sum paid to the owner of the Electromaterial Company in the second half of the year is 1,200 000 peso.
According to the site for more transparency of the city administration, this check issued on a amount of 200.144.56 peso with number 9258447 last November with the purpose of using "open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already forwarded that more money from the community would go to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it is sold at higher prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total that is still due to it and the number of cheques that are still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"It wasn't purchased with her, it's just paid the debt, just as with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "closed" in the last quarter of the year "continued": September 24, two of October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and the last of November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as is required by law when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to prevent other administrations from applying their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be reused.
After the study of the checks issued by the City Administration to its suppliers on July 25, the newspaper Noroeste became known that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010 during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million Pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where they entered cheques in the value of over 3 million peso.
Tourist places must be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the bad condition of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the collapse of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested to pay special attention to the authorities, the areas in a bad state and throw a bad picture to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada dealer association, reminded us that there were various opportunities to care for the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find to new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and roadways would have had a negative effect, as the tourists came to shame and see the disorder, where they would turn back to the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day, and they don't worry about how much money you lose, otherwise they would not perform the construction work slowly and planlessly in this way."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist would have noticed the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance work from the city.
"The community must take over its responsibility and avoid that happens again. How to do so? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in return," he said.
"We are desiring to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we also have a right to have a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to preserve the city in a good state."
"There are other places that also look uncared and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It must be offered a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps tourist attractions constantly in fire," he added.
"This provision has not been given enough attention and this type of incidents expose what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán because they would not be properly used and caused a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought along with the city to frontman. To make the city clean, friendly and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that must first be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive for tourism and to introduce them to the inventory with which we recruit for this destination.
IP calls for results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that the Members should take over the great responsibility of giving an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The business industry of Mazatlán demands a worthy Parliament, free of talks between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was dedicated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 PRI members, 13 PAN members, three participants of Partido Nueva Alianza, two PRDs, one of PTs, one of Convergencia and one of PVEMs. This is a total of 40 representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to make a clean work, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and to not repeat the same patterns of partyability and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Coordination Council of Entrepreneurs, suggested that the new Members should take over the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members really exercise their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because it is common that they make agreements with which they represent their own interests, with which they transform themselves into carnival complexes of the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to the construction of the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We are concerned that they are carrying out a trusted work and engaged in all things for society and their groups, for it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the State, because the economic situation is extremely complicated today.
"The most important is that they promote economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote the creation of jobs."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to grant the necessary positions in the state budget to the Ministry of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the secondless means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchanges and investments to the country and is in direct competition with the agricultural industry."
Tourism projects need to be allocated to money, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been reaffirmed in previous legislature periods, must be updated.
Searching for Holy King
Pups, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes on the next three kings day, because the household is no longer and not less than twelve people and a goat jacket.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel do not give hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and the garments that they so give.
The family inhabits a modest house in the Salvador Allende settlement. They live from their hand in their mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Some times have been told because my husband has no job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... I've been going with the barley for sale on the street already in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like to have a doll or a bike while her three-year-old sister Isabel wishes a barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has been trying to have a 'monster car' for some time, and for his eight-month brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes clothes in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me, "I would like this monster so much," but I answered him, "Let's wait, boy," because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sad.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaías has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A couple of 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help to achieve the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Heiliger König will be looking for' by spending a toys or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspicious drug dealer arrested
On Wednesday, a production and sale network of cannabis was demolished by the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people were arrested and various charges will be charged.
The house searches played in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, where the predominantly drug generation should have served.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of Haschish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philipp Ruel, spokesperson of Quebec's Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, from which two of the men who are considered the main dragon of the drug ring came from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are supposed to have appeared hours after their arrest in Sherbrooke.
They could, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis whose possessions for sale, the plot and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a long-term investigation that took place over a year.
"The information received from public hand has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel stated.
About 70 police officers of the regional detection unit Estrien had participated in this police operation by the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Office and Memphrémagog Police Office.
The secret immigration could be persecuted without problems
The draft law of the conservatives, which, according to the government, is to regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret migrants, will be emphasized by all prospects after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I'm reluctant to this charter."
"I'm holding with a party that put you bowls on your feet," said Michael Ignadief, Chief of Liberals, after the weekly sitting in front of the assembled Members.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law allowing each person to hold up to a year by a person identified as the transport of illegal immigrants, violate the constitution of law and freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, Chief of the Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the draft law, as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has rejected the critics who demand that their party was not standing enough to the secret migrants.
"The Neo Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and we are just trying to implement this by means of another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We do not therefore support the draft law of the conservatives because he is looking for the debt of the refugees and keeping children caught for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties to play with politics and ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians tell the honourable Member that they do not tolerate this kind of intellectual immigration, those criminal processes affecting Canada and treating the country as a footstepsperson."
"They expect Canada to take hard action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
A conservative, however, has said to the QMI Agency that the government would call for a vote so that each opposing Member would explain immediately to his electors.
The new unit does not find any unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the formation of a public inquiry committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea was not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this topic last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has a standing unit against corruption.
Nevertheless, the Wednesday announcement has surprised more than one.
It must be said that, despite Robert Dutils' presence, this measure was not least discussed at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement in pointo public security qualified as "out of the hat burst rabbit" as well as "on a table end right-by-painted solution".
On the other hand, Minister Dutil had turned to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the questioned future unity.
"They will see the result when we are going to announce it," he welcomed to reaffirm himself.
"You're aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest keeps on trying to prevent the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means of forming an investigation committee is the resignation of Jean Charest," Yves Boisvert, lecturer for ethics and policy systems at the ENA (State University for High Administrative Training).
In order to get out of this sackgasse, he proposes to Quebec to grant the financial auditing authority a special mandate in order to provide such research through corruption and secret settlements.
"You should be able to expand the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could confer the same power power as Commissioners, which would allow you to commit people to say.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the leaflets of the government of Charest.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to alter the penal law in that way, to be better occupied with this kind of crime.
This demand comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of the Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the law is not clear in this type of law enforcement.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, on his part, confirmed his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain Novellings relating to this dossier.
During the Operation Printemps in 2001, which involved the groups of motorcycle police, 131 people were arrested, although the penal law had not been novelled.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterdom.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several river runs remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has eroded in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in Mauricie's administrative region, there was a landfall on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening, another earth sleeve took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A street has been collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfall has eroded from 40 to 70 milliliters of rainfall on several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeter rainfall was expected here by Thursday evening according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouai region were most affected.
There were a total of up to 100 millimeter rain showers.
Since these rainfalles are still to be counted on the snow melt that has already been gathered in certain subareas, the crossing of several water runs is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service called warnings about the flood alarm on the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The river runs in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurent Mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the severe rainfall has moved to pass over some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a retirement bridge was progressed due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the violation of certain lakes caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains in alert and monitors the situation at least, according to safety adviser Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Highwater Center issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, especially from Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partly corrected Dupont
The Quebec broadcast moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial relapse before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of its controversial statements on social care and Haitians as well as because of his decent speech about radio.
The CCNR argues that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their own opinion, but certain statements would "not contain accurate information on social care and unauthorized negative representations of the Haitians as well as such an unincreased speech that is not appropriate for the daily broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which includes the spread of the names of two persons who have committed suicide, violates the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 period.
The first decision was filed as a result of a complaint from the "Front commune of the personnes assistées socials du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inadequate.
The moderators should provide solid information rather than misleading information.
With regard to the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont expressed the view that suicide was an expression of humility.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the conveyed message was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the relevant consequences of the Dupont le midi mission would have adapted a sensitive topic in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was not charged with any reproach against his person.
The last point of dispute was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given themselves a media-effective debate that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI engineer had explained not to have donated for the benefit of the Haiti aid, as one would not surely know whether the needy would actually receive the donations of money.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments have not been misused character, but that their cumulative effect presents an unauthorised negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already paid off my three-day suspension penalty in this case."
"My file has been young for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board calls for the spread of an unrestuted expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcasters acted "beyond their obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, among other things, which had had to inform his decisions once during the main end time within a period of three days, are small.
A king of Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has entered a very special course.
The athlet, brilliant in "Sanda" (Vollkontakt Kung-Fu), in the kickboxes and in the Thai boxes, is now rising in the search for new challenges to Tatami and to the world's box rings.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with fighting sports such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxen," said Zemmal, who has been located in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight of all places, because those who like to present the ground fight, as the mixed fighting art, are not fun for them to fight in North America."
Recently, his sign as a security officer, as well as the company UPS employed, gave his rivals bad news, in which he ranked two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the world championship of the amateurs between October 23 and 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I achieved the victory in the categories of Kickboxen and the Thaiboxen," he explained.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"They were invited those fighters from every category who had been placed among the first four at the last World Championship."
"I got babe 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"In 2005 I became in Vietnam Back."
"2007 I ended the tournament in China at the fifth place, while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, where fausts and footsteps are allowed as well as soil roots.
The two fights usually play on a platform, more rarely in a box ring.
The most renowned box fighter, which has come from this type of fighting sport, is the American Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, which is probably known in the world of battle art.
If Nacer had to retain Zemmal only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super-Turnier "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," said the sympathic pound ceremony.
"It's a bit like the equivalent to the stadium of Lumpinee (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Ten times in the semi-finale of his category (80kg) he won his first fight before he lost in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the king of the Kung-Fu."
450 million in contracts without invitation to tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant 450 million dollars of contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert water force project.
A consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely the project leader, to a total of 295 million dollars without a tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a accompanied by the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to deliver this important hydroelectric project to a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" was aggravating the lucrative contract, without having been a public tender.
For the Québécois party, the withdrawal to consortia of companies is a serious ethical problem which is the risk of competing and a price increase.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and awakens competition."
"That means that instead of arranged games in a secret way, it is now in open form," said Sylvain Simard, PQ's Deputy Member, yesterday at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how public interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by proposing that this contract would have been a carded game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she betrayed by strengthening that the PQ was "unreasonable" and "missing her hard."
She said it was "the minimum," that the PQ apologizes.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to bundle their expertise with regard to a command to a tender for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project shows a high level of complexity with regard to its workout.
The construction process is in progress and is supposed to be established by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without a competition struggle; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec even with relatively simple projects no longer constitutes an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of engineering and consultancy is subject to government communications.
A short flight from the Quebec corporate register allows it to designate more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Each link, and there are several dozens of them, leads back to the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As far as the consortium "Énergie gérance" is concerned, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Many James is subject to a special labour force dynamic and that hydro-Québec has given special consideration to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has made the nose about the fact that the contract on the project management was approved after agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only few candidates, your prices will be faster."
"You have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this Mart and say to you, one will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people," reaffirmed Laporte.
This contract approved to the Konsortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the Le Devoir newspaper counted more than 100 engineering and consultant contracts, which were approved between 2002 and March 2010 by companies or their branches, including resource laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin had been recruited 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without computing their participation in "Energie gérance".
All of these contracts have been negotiated.
They totalled $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had made it clear that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that they "financed" before clarifying that it was rather about their leaders.
Barometer of Responsible Consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Green but unrounded skeptical.
The Quebec Consument has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also in no way in relation to the marked brands or the eco markings to control its choice.
Sadly, although it is bathing in a media-effective universe, where it is only so diminishing from information in favour of a more responsible consumer: the barometer of responsible consumption has to complain of a lack of credible information, an inadequacy which makes itself known as a brake of his engagement, as the first reading showed that was held yesterday.
Although they have driven the consumption of so-called socially tolerable products in 2010, the Quebecians still seem to have little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admit that in fact, to give little faith to the ecological engagement of companies as well as to the green business advertising, the measured instrument from the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke shows.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthiness of official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands, which declare themselves as environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the politicians' discourse on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
However, information on responsible consumers seems important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently used by almost one third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptiness and doubtful nature of the information were opposed to the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of the Quebecians is mystrous about the performance of the green products and services that are being used for them.
According to another communication, over half of consumers in 2010 had changed their habits and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their convictions.
According to Barometer, they had also preferred 61% of purchases in dealers of their district and favored the purchase of foods built in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumption of Quebec loves to present itself as king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by caring for animal protection.
However, social and ecological consciousness seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecians have indicated, used public transport in 2010, or preferred to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The admission and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavior survey, which feeds the clischee suggestions.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, declares that cooperation is agreed, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois cinema complexes eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to re-represent it from his actual cineastic function, apparently does not receive what they required.
Although the government has accepted to engage in this matter, it is under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a lesser bond than the initial hoped amount that could create a viable solution to beneficial conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources that are acceptable from the public rumors.
A first action plan as well as an application for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, which has been corrected since the again summarily downward.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who leads the eXcentris Act.
Several days ago, he had given her a final record.
However, the counter proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time to answer them until 31 December.
In any case, the premises of the State donation seem to have been really pushed to the side.
Let us recall that the Quebec ownership community of the cinema and cinema complex had resigned against a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by giving the argument that the minister of cults had no financial assistance for real estate projects there which he did not have to receive other cinemas as well.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic aid.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had presented the author-in-house kino in the rooms of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception from the State Casse for more than ten years.
The lack of cinemas, which show independent films, is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the stage.
The Société Angus as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top of them operates a privately financed campaign, from which they hope a sum of $700 000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinemas on February 27 next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des Dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not called off the newspaper "Le Devoir", and they are ignored what he and his group hold of the proposals that have been corrected downwards.
Mystery of the complexly shakened Canada ventilated
The new American diplomatic lines, spread by WikiLeaks, exploded the mystery of what the United Nations considered under the inferiority complex of the Canadians to the Americans, but with the same stroke they open the superiority to Canada.
Thus, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian elector does not have the Canadian-American relations in mind during the election, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to carry out their 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more pikant details than the mere material content to which one has to knack.
A connection dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period during which the federal election campaign was fully held, reports on which point the United Nations no longer participated in the interventions discussed by its political chiefs.
For the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A virtually inhabitant complex of inferiority may cause the Canadian, political leaders to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than to push the United States to black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, are therefore "the pronounced Goliath of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The ambassador understands this "orbitant silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assessed, "it must be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party chief to conduct such an essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in mind during the course of the election."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the communication sent by Terry Breese, businessmen in Ottawa on January 22, 2009, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the continued existence of the government in the voluntary voting of the federal budget at the beginning of February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which was created by an effort programme of 30 to 40 billion dollars," Breese describes.
He never mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from crashing from the coalition and to affect the quality of the proposed opposition programme.
Another communication written by the Ambassador Wilkins, dating from January 2008, understands Washington from the ever-neglecting picture that the dramatic series of CBC spread from the United States.
The ambassador is worried about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where you can observe little subtle presentations to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also deductions for the purposes of CIA's muscle prots.
Another communication explains in detail how Hillary Clinten asked her French colleagues Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual case decision.
à the end of the meeting, as described, "has he handed out to the state secretary a paper in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file again."
Finally, let's remember that the minds are heated with regard to WikiLeaks' website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely standing consultant, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "turned".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for renewal of lighting
The UN has proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan for renewal of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW) which corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction to be realized in order to stabilise the Earth climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction obligations in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of FCKWs issued on the ground due to lighting, if the white-glowing pears, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, by luminous diodes (LED).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fluorescent park.
Last year, in Copenhagen, the major exhaust issuers such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, this balance sheet would have to be deducted from 5 Gt to stabilise climate rise by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 to prevent it from being controlled.
In the white glowing pears, 95% of the energy in the form of heat disappears, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice.
The compact bulbs keep between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those which the manufacturer Philips has marketed this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white glowing bulb, which provides an improvement in the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely novel bulbs donate very little heat, they can also function with a regular resistance.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light fuel berries have reserves, as they contain mercury and that they must be disposed of as a special waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except the producers provide an acceptance site.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, does not constitute the compact luminous berne, but rather the coal power plants that emit much more mercury to produce the electricity waste from the white glowing pears.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury each year.
The report presents the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars annually in purchasing electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion Indonesia.
Ivory Coast expects an excitement of the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "uncompromising" publication of the results of the presidential election of the ivory coast directly after their expiry of time.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent election commission to receive their work and to disclose the provisional results without further delay," said a press speaker of the UN Chief.
"He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove their responsibility and to include each initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exercised by certain foreign governments, the Election Commission had expired the Deadline, which was set at midnight on Wednesday, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CEI on television had confirmed that the Commission would "continuously continue with the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have become loud, the CEI may finally call the name of the winner of the second round of election under the Laurent Gbagbo and its opposer Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo-Lager expects the cancellation of "deceptive" voting fees in the north through the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failure of the coupling in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the FN-practised manoeuvres to intimidate the electors in the north of the country had deterred the president's followers to go to the election.
The entire choice could be canceled if the complaints imposed by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contradictions are now more of the opinion that the highest court of the country is not neutral, as it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north who disagrees any connection with the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in proclaiming the results of the election as "unreliable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to demand the victory.
His alliance partners reaffirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results, as he knows that he has lost; and submit a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Election Commission from publishing the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the association and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the politicians of the ivory coast that they could be held responsible for them in the event of possible excesses.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is 9.3% (including overseas departments at 9.7%) within the meaning of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, according to the provisional, seasonally adjusted information published by the Federal Statistical Office Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The figures of the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In detail, 3.4 million employees of the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wished to find a job, including whether they were employable every two weeks or not or whether they were seeking or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the young people between 15 and 24 years were unemployed according to the IAA.
On the other hand, the seniors have a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of the over 50-year-old people, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion on its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee has no longer published monthly unemployment numbers since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union's Statistical Office, continues in this method and announced a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) on Tuesday, compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the Board of Directors of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), was initiated a investigation procedure and he was sent to the prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of a investigation procedure on the public and fraud-proven markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of being dismissed by society, contaminating general goods, healing, medication in corruption, unauthorized bribery and arms ownership, so his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini fights ready and is ready to express himself on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him instead of spreading the brains."
"It is easy to submit to him a number of offences, another thing is to prove it," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Press) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (parti socialist) in the department, had devoted attention to allowing the judge to a memorial for his justification before he heard his lawyer.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than keeping his deposit he had to lead.
He would never have known the business area or the target location of the associated fund, as Simon said.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Balling Area, was also accused of undermining and compatibility on Wednesday, but then relocated under the presidency of keeping away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to give explanations to the facts that were accused of him."
"The executive prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were accused and were released from the prison at the night from Tuesday on Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, said the Deputy Supreme Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted by "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two government officials of the Aubagne Balling Area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier were also arrested, which, due to the title "Relief and Contribution of General Goods by a Public Service Officer", was also arrested.
The lifemate of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of the "hoaling and undercutting of society's assets".
Among the people who were confronted with Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned because of a similar affair of fraudulent acts from public hand that affected Corsica.
The flagrs suspected his society to contribute to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X is carried out in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letter in the documents of several open investigation procedures for the award of public contracts, particularly in the field of disposal.
According to close research sources, the investigation focuses particularly on the conditions of surcharge and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the area of Aubagne, as well as to certain cities of Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde rice: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediate function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran for spionage, held the French public in breath, placed diplomacy in alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
This is all under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and viewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some backgrounds to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to Americans his strategy to give these advice to deal with their own crisis of "spirits" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French controllers tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and by American justice due to trade with material in favour of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible to believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of clotile rice, in a grilled light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram, which was edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostages".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategy issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised the Americans to put everything in order to return their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
"May noise," they said, "articulated loudly and clearly and without undercutting" the words "Ground Human Rights", "innocence", "fortunate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which respects his image very sensitive.
"Take this more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do that."
Because "silence doesn't solve anything," passing the discussions on unattractive ways, the Iranians are "masters in rebellion manoeuvres".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common, Iranian tactic": "Frequence for political expression".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reis from the prison (which was to come on August 16th, on the day she fled into the French Embassy) "demand for the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230,000 Euro deposit).
And he makes pronounceable that Elysée anticipes further hostages, a phenomenon that will "sarse itself."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotile rice was released 12 days ago, but is still held in Iran.
An information has been brought into circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery demands the United States for illegal trade with sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from prison after a judge in Paris decided.
The American message, like many other observers, poses questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France purchased a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
During a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "full surprised by the judge's decision", but also attempted to reject it.
"There has been a real exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "strong" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant selects a telephone number, sets up again, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "is currently located in the buildings guided by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During Clotilde Reis' preservation in Iran, the Elysée does not save his efforts to believe by means of announcements and media organized "flight attempts", the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating from 25 August 2009 summons "the media flash of the French authorities".
On the basis of so much "thankful witnessing" to Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy wonders.
"Too much of their statements full of praise confess the French authorities in secret that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then addresses the reasons why the Elysée has made this fiction fall.
He analyses the intensive communication efforts "to confirm Sarkozy's open-up policy towards Syria".
A policy launched in 2008, which was then "as early and unprecedented by numerous criticisms in France and abroad".
"The Syrian role builds up" is trying to lead Paris "Syria in mind what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sown twist between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier had trusted her: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians did whatever."
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion with the Iranians."
Clotile rice returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanks the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countryman".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Ashenbrödel", which will forbid the youth to play online games after midnight by sparing them access, so government responsible.
A draft law to call on the online game operators to refuse access to these games for young people under 16 years after midnight, will be presented to Parliament in December, painted representatives of cult and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulties in learning at school and also in conducting a normal life throughout the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this draft law-making ministerial officer of the French press agency Agence France Press.
The online games are again available from 6 a.m. onwards.
The producer companies would have a year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, so he clarified.
The government also intends to ask the manufacturers to cut down the time limit given daily for access to these games to the young people whose parents ask for it, the controller added.
He will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events connected with intensive Internet use.
The country is also inappropriate championship in global online game competitions.
In November South Korea had achieved four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: the FIFA appoints the founder country
In bright excitement due to corruption suspicion, the Executive Committee of the FIFA amends the educators of the World Championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which the ranking for influence and lobbying threatens to impress the technical criteria.
One thing, however, is certain: the 2018 edition of the FIFA's Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional Highburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 issue will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes that after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, new territories (Catar, Australia) will be able to win for themselves, or continue to pursue its branches in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Soocrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the measure of the economic and political use of a World Championship.
So the machinations behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to create a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) file offer more arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, with the launch of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the expulsions, could also have ruined the chances for their own country, Wiege of the Football, which only one time allowed the World Championship, namely 1966.
On Monday, the BBC had again given the nutritional floor by broadcasting a documentary report, which took three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to angry the FIFA and put the English responsible people embarrassed who, primarily with David Cameron, had intense lobbying in these last weeks.
The head of the government is hoping for a new edition of the chess train succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intense use suffice to re-evaluate the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe, because the Duo Spain-Portugal does not lack trumpets with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shades of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible repressals against the English as well as doubts about the solvance of Spain and Portugal allow Russia to rise, despite its gaps in the dossier (Stadien, Hotels, Transport) to a weighty outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, decided to plead the unquestioned protest on the notices of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"You throw her with dirty, you're trying to compromise her," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA principal sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages compared to Japan and South Korea, which separately set up a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidates seem to be early for two countries who had participated in the competition in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA's hot-looking approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which causes Asian chances to fall down on 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled all the registers with the expectation of futuristic stages, FIFA pursues its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, for certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, may have suffered the sensitive nerve of the FIFA, under the weakness of television rights accrued by the European countries.
Second mandate: openness
The Gaulle had really been cut.
In the middle of the world he had to believe he was stubborn.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in Elysée calls the next one.
The current Head of State will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But openness is not the side of the mystery, which is liable to the presidency function.
So you have to do as if the doubt stands fortan.
In the one, as well as in the other sense.
In 2006, the adherents Jacques Chiracs suggested that a third mandate should not be excluded without having to believe in it itself.
On November 15, Nicolas assured Sarkozy in serious tone to make his decision "in the autumn of 2011".
That on Tuesday evening in Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians, he would have made the perspective of "two mandates" a little fever liability.
Was that the official announcement of his candidateship?
Far missing.
The President merely reminded that the constitutional change in 2008 limits the number of five years of official periods to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't think about the phase after that."
His words of yesterday do not make him a candidate more than the previous day; but also not less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidature with the PS on one side.
It is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy is trying to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidate in 2012, which advises many members of the PS early than adopted for the fighting anniversary.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the electors of the right would prefer a candidate of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions about it with the UMP," responded immediately and carefully to the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he would be a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin informed.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has found himself out with openness.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its purchases of State papers
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should offer opportunities to show how to get out of the crisis or at least announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy to come to their conclusion at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European State debt obliges that the Central Bank in Frankfurt cannot afford to do so, even today's more than anxious situation in the European bond markets, so that they do not create their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, welcomed yesterday at a press conference the active role taken by the ECB in resolving Europe's government debt.
It did not dare to say whether it was the opinion that the Central Bank could do more, for example by stimulating its programme of purchasing State bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, was not very speaking about his projects, but was rather pleased to point out that the programme of purchasing State papers on the secondary market would "develop" and that we will be "seeing the decision-makings at the meeting on Thursday".
Only certainty: The ECB will leave its headline rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the Treasury were doubled from the ECB to approximately EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And according to indiscretions of some dealers, she should have done new purchases on Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Under the dealers, the anti-zipulation of the purchasing rate is not doubted at all (see page 29).
People's farmers are not expecting a remarkable change in courses.
If the bonds of over three months will already have disappeared from the ECB's Arsenal, the latter will create themselves in a free manner at the full reserves of funds, over a period of one week to three months.
The farmers are already committed to extending this measure for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme."
"Otherly, she would risk provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, Volkswirt der Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," is anticipated by Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions on the state debt market, "the ECB has to maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that are occupied by the market", Norbert Bräms adds.
In view of the relevance of the exponential position of European banks on the euro area markets, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must take place on the market at any price to the stewards of the lack of investors and act in such a way as to prevent the premature enthusiasm of the yields paid to the weakest countries," said a major bond holder yesterday.
Because if the interest rates are to be fixed, the states would even more be prevented from reducing their debt or also stabilizing it.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi government is going to cover Italy
After an alarming weekly beginning for Italy, the situation has been somewhat relaxed yesterday with the decline in the quarterly interest rate to 10 years.
A return to deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional chairman Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indispensable" and had expected to hear it with an "unpredictable" weekend, but the person immediately demented.
On Tuesday, however, the Schere with the German interest rates would have reached its 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy were increased to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain's disparity with the German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "heartedly worried" of the "market turbulences" and a potential risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at the Hudson Institute.
It is clear that its problem is the absenteement of economic growth and the associated, susceptible tax revenues that threaten the state to no longer cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected... although the Senate budget is estimated at 1.3% or 2% for examining.
Under these conditions, according to the EU Commission, the budget deficit will continue to be 4.3% of GDP in the next year (other than 3.9% foreseen by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (but 2.7%).
Therefore, the retirement of a new budget collective, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new savings must be taken," says economic auditor Olli Rehn.
At the hour, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The fundamental festivals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have already repeated for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian faithful of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, neither in the short-term, nor in the long-term perspective, as Italy demands less stabilisation progress than other countries, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.", notes Pier Carlo Padoan, CEO of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be faced with a request for suspicion from the Chamber of Members, as a result of which the elections in question could already be organised at the end of March.
It is therefore a little favourable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of anticrisis measures
Christine Lagarde had explicitly highlighted it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think you have proved it on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: the Europeans are clearly keeping together, willing and committed to defending their currency and their monetary area."
Although completely relative - yesterday's deduction in the interest rates of the European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to talk about a start of normalisation.
The Rating Agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt note, probably the most effective target of speculants today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, particularly in the banking systems," said the people's farmers of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially, "the political time is going much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger that is hidden in it, intensify the discussions on strengthening the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned financial ministers and, in a further sense, with their counterparts of the G20 go well.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroups and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan is designed to cover the unconventional measures to strengthen the eurozone countries in the cross-section of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, Klaus Regling has already started its Asian tour on Tuesday in Singapour to inform the investors in the Far East about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit Fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain to do so.
The first advertising paper expenditure on the EU Stability Fund is planned for the next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of Reuters Agency had trusted, the United States supported a possible increase in the mobilised fund by the additional, direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are sending themselves to take over structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisations.
Reforms, which are to be added to saving measures, should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other, at any price, is to avoid the need to ask for international assistance before setting up their own budget corrective and decideing on inadequate structural reforms that will give them long-term confidence.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of the markets of State bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on the passover in Paris on 24 November, had first raised the idea that if the EUR 750 mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to retake its own bag.
Barclay's Capital's peoples, with regard to the market of European government debt, judged that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, preferably, in the form of a direct liquidity syringe.
This means: the European mechanism of dotting financial stability, which is currently EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board with all the opportunities to be carefully examined in the European main cities.

Snow and Glatteis: 24 Departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow episodes are still taking into account traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threatening to affect various economic activities.
Four-en-twinty departments are now in alarm level orange due to the threatening snow and glactic risks.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in Orange Alarm Level; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers tangle the north of Gironde and the Charentes, it sneaks easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, as well as from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is striking enough to cause traffic disabilities and affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are locked for heavy transport of over 7.5 tonnes, including the traffic axis Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The transport situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police who are not advised to use their own vehicle only in emergency cases, and the use of some TER buses has been deleted all day long.
In the Picardie, school traffic was revoked for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "demands the drivers to be careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested the airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Roissy Airport in Paris on Thursday and 10% of the flights from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in southern London as well as the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are locked until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy in the Ile-de-France has been in full progress, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, we recall the 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead the construction of the SGP into the paths, the State has issued a capital dotation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to grant a part of the financial sum to its twofold in the markets.
Today it has finally come to first bills.
The 2010 supplementary budget, through the financial commission of the National Assembly, sets out the measures for the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax for the establishment and higher taxation of offices at Ile-de France.
First, according to Article 15 of the draft law, "for the benefit of the public-legislative Société du Grand Paris".
This figure is: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
Secondly, it is a reorganization of the already existing company taxation: "To modernise this product to increase its resulting product and to convey this increase of Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
A mystery.
This sum is not counted in the text.
From the 4 billion you are far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital dotation that are put up by the State and that the Société du Grand Paris is gradually made for the project," the explaining explanation is to be found.
The SGP does not find this system inconsistency at all.
"Since the moment when you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projection for three years and then only create from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is notified in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 billion promised one will be able to look for for a long time, is a risk of calling for a rather moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Racky hacker and emsige spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double significance.
On one side, she has come out as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is just a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy, which rules the relationships between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a prepayment to the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead of the row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file, created by a secret service, is exclusively composed of newspaper cuts.
The "external", American unveilings about the sexual habits of Berlusconis are nothing more than throwing away what you could read in every x-loving journal for months (except those whose owners are Berlusconi), and the alarming caricatured profile Gaddafis has been offering cabaret artists for their squeaks for a long time.
The rule, after which the secret dossiers may only consist of already known news, is essential for the dynamics of secret services, not until this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will recognize that every work (via the Gral, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chatteau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzlers) has been repeated exactly what was already written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (but not only that he did not know where to find news about the non-existing), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Just like the secret records.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (other than he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Decree, were the same as those who had published Newsweek the week before.
So why was such a lifting for the uncovering of these dossiers made?
On one side, these say what any educated person already knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the Heads of Government have been able to call each other or take a plane to meet at dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have turned into spionage centres, with the exception of some small representation tasks.
Every spectator of investigative films knows this very accurately, and it does not happen from hypocrisy that one does so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is publicly repeated violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-popular hacker can tackle the most secrets of the most powerful country in the world is the significant blow against the prestige of the State decree.
In addition, the scandal brings the victims less than the "crackers" in distress.
But we devote ourselves to the profound nature of what happened.
Once, at Orwell's time, all power could be bundled like a Big Brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have proved to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, any transaction, the visited hotel, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizens would become a total victim of the eye of power.
However, if one considers what is going on today, that even the secret cripts of the power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control process stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as a robber of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
How, though, can a power that is no longer able to preserve their own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real mystery is an empty secret (and an empty mystery can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free of secretism, since it gives the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this distress that has been added to such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that the states will not put any reserved information online in the future - that would be similar to an excerpt on the road.
But it is also obvious that it is forgotten with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier to find out if and when a Head of State moved away in a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
In the future, how could private and only for certain ears have certain relationships?
I know very well that at the moment my prediction sounds to science fiction and romance, but I see that I am needed to imagine the government agents, in a secret way moving on uncontrollable march routes, not carrying their communications with themselves anywhere but in the mere memory, and also concealing the few written information they have received in the shoeset.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, the spying test of Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer today, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionated communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephonic) wire.
The (analogians) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for band by spranging from the back to the front and ventilating all the secrets of assembly, while the (numerical) CDs today are not able to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
With the high speed trains you drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while it takes three and a half hours by plane including the climb.
It is therefore not exceptional that policy and communication technology come back on car and horse.
A last observation.
In ancient times, the press tried to understand what secrets were smed between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks his financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the rapidly dissolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or early financing) that the developing countries have realized.
And already the rough French beautiful talks have been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1,26 billion euros (e.g. 420 million a year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn all registers to convince its partners of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed action report of its Member States, press conference, large side events, brochure distribution.
Operation transparency is noteworthy and high for its actual value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see it if all the developed countries did the same at the same precision level.
The EU announces that in 2010 it has released 2.2 billion euros, which brings them to the right way to respect for its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional use has been introduced, without being disadvantaged by public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what means "new and additional".
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone selects the correct value that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a target value for those in 2009: international financing will be maintained and will give 150 million in the framework of the Financing of "Fast-Start" for three years.
Other countries have chosen similar target values, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at public development aid.
In return, France felt that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no targets in the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total French support for developing countries can remain stable (or also decrease) - France suggests that its commitment to "new and additional" finances be respected.
Another, crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule on this, and everyone selects his calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 borrowed € as equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is only difficult to understand: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments can be justified (often linked to the emission reduction) projects based on the most effective technology, it is fraudulent to present the euro, which is included as equivalent for a donated euro, and only the costs of the loan for the capital investor country should be charged as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by recording 91.5% loans (€389.8 million) and spending 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince themselves of it.
France is the only country of the EU that is largely using loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (e.g.) follow their commitments to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the majority of the European Union spends 1€ in fulfilling its obligations, France just gives 10 cents and understands similar use.
Beautiful hocuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: to a part with further development of the action over time and to the other part with the reality of financial use.
France manages to believe that it spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (which seems to have been Bercy who has carried out the Arbitrage) could lead to a double negative effect; once EU-internal (why do the other Member States continue to borrow if they are enough) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of early financing only a small question for relatively short time compared to the overall discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much the drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is indispensable to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its type of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equality with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward discussions on the dispute of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently discussed subject): the question of "reliability" or the type of accounting of its loans is not addressed.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as to the disputes as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, which will meet in Cancun the next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "religibility" and the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes over the day 81 different chemicals, a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of rights and respect of generations coming).
The association, which explains that their results "are not statistically significant, given the small number of analysed samples, but represent illustration character of the treated problem," between July and September, the usually bought within four, from a approximately ten-year-old child to the meal-consumed food plus an interim meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined as well as wetries of laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemicals, including 42 considered potentially or likely cancer-influential and five classified as safe carciogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine distortion factor, according to studies of several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in the nearing total of cases, the legal limits are not exceeded for any chemical, individually consumed substance, this survey is very well taken out that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancer or substances with endocrine distortion factor is anxious", notes the association.
Even at breakfast, the butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially cancerous residues and three safely as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as a interim meal for the study, shows traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study identified traces of insecticides which are strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna from the bush, even the Baguette and the gum of pesticides and other chemicals were spitted.
The analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was at the "richest", and even the plastic plates used to warm up the meal in the microwave were not unloaded.
The ultimate risk of this "damage cocktail" for consumers is "probably under-evaluated", said the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has, on the other hand, proposed "in the light of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "accession of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
