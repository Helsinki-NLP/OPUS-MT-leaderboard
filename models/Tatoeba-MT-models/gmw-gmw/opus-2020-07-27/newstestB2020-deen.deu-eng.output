Brand deleted in French chemistry
The large fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been deleted. This shared the prefecture of the Normandie on Friday. The fire was broken out on Thursday at night. Nobody was injured at the incident. The fire gun was in use with about 200 clearing vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Annexers were called not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and children's gardens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemistry work on the bank of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-Milliardary Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict security requirements.
In the work, around 400 people work. The chemical factory already provided for headlines in the past - for example, when the gas methanthiol was removed by a leak in 2013 and the surroundings were widely smoked by faint eggs. In 2015, after an operation accident, some 2,000 litres of mineral oil fled into the city's wastewater system.
Woman announces her job to search for 57 days of her disappeared dog
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her disappeared dog - and announced her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie was cut off from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days from the dog lacked any trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was horrible. I got bad," said Carole King to the "Dayly Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to the dinner. Then when they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal but without success.
Donner had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says: "She has traveled about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King remembers "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately out. A loud thunder probably had put the dog in panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But from days there were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postman to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flourished"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man reported himself and said that Katie was found in his courtyard. But when King arrived there, Katie was already disappeared. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her hendin under a tree. "I just embraced her. I wouldn't let her go," recalled King, "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears were fled. People stopped in their vehicles, rose out and embraced us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found them."
Loss of the Federal Army: Machine guns disappear spurlessly
Friday 27 September 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Federal Army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases the residual is unclear. The opposition speaks of a "angering" extent.
In the Federal Army, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them so far spurless. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has reported the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons parts and almost 20,000 shot ammunition. This is the result of a listing of the Federal Defense Ministry, which the German editorial network reports.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, a weapon part and 3474 shot ammunition have appeared again. The still disappeared weapons and weapon parts include six machine guns of type MG3, eleven guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns and two pistols of type P8. In addition, 30 arms tubes of type MG3 are missing.
The amount of weapons and ammunition losses in the Federal Army was "angering," said the Left-Bundestag Deputy Martina Renner. This was all the more, since in the course of investigations there was hardly anything found again. The Left-Politiker spoke of a "difficulty balance". Renner criticized that in the listing it was not possible to recognise whether under the disappeared ammunition the one who was also found in connection with the investigations against the German army officer Franco A. "And that even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for the possession of this ammunition," Renner said.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on this Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitive showed, the tanker was moving and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was given as a destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian government on Monday, but at first he remained in Iranian waters. The shipowner said that they wanted to wait for an official decision from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" had been accused of violating security rules by the Iranian revolutionary gardens in the Hormuz sea street on 19 July. However, it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tank before Gibraltar belonging to the United Kingdom.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea streets in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have been intensified in recent months. The trade shipship was taken into the conflict between the USA and Iran. It has come to several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of humans in the Fruitful Revolution
Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel cherished the commitment of people in the GDR, who had gone to the street 30 years ago in the Fruitful Revolution. In autumn 1989, courageous citizens would have made the DDR regime weak, Merkel said at a festival act of the Thüringer CDU-Fraktion on the upcoming day of German Unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor reminded of the occupation of the Stasi-Zentrale. "The state security was taken the horr," she said.
Musk seeks delivery record
Teslas quarter may keep records ready. Despite delivery tree, there were last losses in the electric car group.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given strong boost to his electric car group with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100.000 deliveries," wrote Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the "Electrek" industry blog.
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musks newsletter. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customership. Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
investors liked this: Teslas shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. So strongly the course has not been due for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs record in order to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be made in the current and next quarter of the year. The most affordable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the margins of profit are low. Despite the tree there were last losses.
Solved puzzles: That's why we can't tie ourselves
A kind of brake in the big hirn prevents people from being able to cushion themselves. This found scientists from the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Also progress had been made at the question why children are so strongly opposed to the kitzels, just to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the approach of a cementing hand triggers laughing before touching. This was lying on a low layer in the big shirt, which already triggers laughing at the expectation of the kitzeln.
According to the information, previous research showed that rats respond with "lach" in the ultrasound area when they are kitted by humans. This "lach" is conveyed by the part of the large herrrind, which serves as the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-infection
So far, it has been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-contact and touch by others - so people cannot be able to cushion themselves.Berlin's researchers now found in the experiments at the rats that laughing as well as the activity of the area of the major brain rings in question were suppressed during a self-contact. This was also the case if life creatures were cleaning themselves. During the foreign touch and the kitzeln by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse were increased.
However, if the self-contact and touching by others at the same time, the laughter also suppressed. This suggests that the rat’s brain could not differ between self-contact and touch by others. The new insights suggested that humans cannot calm themselves because self-contribution activates a brake in the large brain.
The rats had also been trained to occupy themselves. Thus, they sometimes broke this initiation in the experiment, showed escape behavior or horror. This ambition was similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the kitzeln is a behavioral reaction that was equal in rats and humans.
Dismissed disaster: Great fire in French chemistry deleted
The large fire in a particularly dangerous chemistry in the northern French city of Rouen has been deleted. This told the prefecture of the standard andies of the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire was broken out on Thursday at night.
According to the authorities, no health-threatening substances are supposed to have occurred. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. Nobody was injured during the incident. The firefire was in use with about 200 clearing vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Inhabitants were called not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in Parliament after the withdrawal of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country without agreements from the EU on 31 October, should not allow Brussels to comply with its demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement. However, as he wants to achieve this, it is unclear.
About Cox, who had been employed for the United Kingdom's stay in the European Union, said the Prime Minister: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memorial and to re-establish this country would have been to execute the EU's exit." Cox was murdered by a legal extremist during the referendum election in 2016.
Mahnmal to attacks by Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths in Norway on Saturday, the monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Eisenroses) consists of about 1,000 iron roses. They remember the roses that had been deposited by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in Oslo before the Dome.
At the same place, the project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be unveiled - the roses have been smed by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Among other crown prince Haakon and crown princess Mette-Marit are expected to open.
On July 22, 2011, the legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first shot a car bomb in the government district of Oslo, and afterwards on the island of Utöya dozen participants of the youth camp of the social-democratic working party. In total, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate brought no solution in the Iran conflict. But now there is a less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could get back to the lake. It could be a puzzle piece in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid July is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as Stena Bulk told.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now travel for medical investigations to Dubai, said Reederei Chief Erik Hånell. By noon, the ship left the Iranian waters. "Because it's over," he said to the Swedish television station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain shipship and international law," said a communication on Friday.
On 19 July the Iranian revolutionary warfare had made the tanker in charge of disregarding the rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released early in September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well accordingly, said Hånell. They had been professional in the face of the difficult and uprising situation over the past ten weeks. The shipowner is now working to bring them together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected that after the fixing of the "Stena Impero" a similar incident in British Gibraltar, there was a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposedly intended for Syria, to be placed on the chain. According to the delivery, the authorities were dismissed against EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The reference to the ship had received the British from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Admonitions, it was a exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" free from London.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea streets in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have been intensified in recent months. The trade shipfare has been brought into the conflict between the USA and Iran. It has come to several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Teheran and Washington, the nuclear battle of both countries, the Americans are proposing the Iranian leaders to want to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the U.S. had departed from the international nuclear agreement, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and, at the same time, end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put the leadership in Teheran with massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure in order to force a more strict and in other areas enlarged agreement. Iran is resisting the pressure to date.
Due to the dispute about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the USA are working on a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the street of Hormus at the UN Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without any foreign protection powers, wants to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestinated to the "war gainer". Given the penalty duties imposed by American President Donald Trump against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to rediscover. Financial Chiefs of Asian companies who consider to transfer their production from China to another country call India in a UBS survey as one of the preferred alternatives. This has not only to do with the inconveniences of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers as well as a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to play a more important role in the global widespread production chain.
But now India itself has been concentrated in Trump's focus. From the hood in the White House depreciated as "Colon of Customs", America has withdrawn the trade advantages for 2000 products to the emerging country in early June. The United States prohibits India and demands a better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the tyrants with India are freely an adjacent scene. In addition, America also views the world's largest democracy through the security-policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combines the concern of China's power claims in the South Indian Ocean. In this context an American prison sentence against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term, is likely to weigh in safety.
However, the problem lies in another place: The empirically hardened theses that open markets accelerate economic development has a severe state in the Socialist Republic of India. His reform endeavour mainly aimed at the bureaucratic insanity, which has sucked all too long business spirits in the multi-popular state. Companies now receive faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more pronounced insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions to liquidate seemot companies with high debts faster.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic optics in India, in the first five modes years, much has been used to be better. However, in the trade policy, this does not apply.Thereby, the national conservative government even set up new barriers to protect internationally little competitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, modes of the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews its country. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister only knows too well what vocabulary Western managers like. In the core, the "India First" advokat never turned away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to unpaid anachronistic processes and thus fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive through the destruction of their industries are among the root selectors of fashionist Bharatiya Janata Party and complain of these short-sighted policies.
Adopted by Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to former French president Jacques Chirac, a report will be submitted in Paris in the next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at Montparnasse cemetery in the southern part of the French capital, reports the AFP news agency under appeal to the Chiracs family. The burial will take place in the close family circle. A public funeral celebration was held in the Pariser Invalidendom for Sunday, as media reported.
The competitors were led to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the light-athletic WM
The world point has already been in the goal of the cheating Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swim dangerously. He could hardly keep himself 300 meters in front of the destination almost on the legs, ran in an unhealthful attitude when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly interrupted him and supported him the last half stage round of the goal. However, the forces were still enough to stop the running watch after the destination. As if the scene would not have been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the gathered journalists. He only refused to be ashamed, he didn't want to talk about his hero act at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time, and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only a sufferer. And at least he would be proud of representing his country, which was invited to the World Association. Under normal circumstances, he would not have even be allowed to start. "That is why I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this on the evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he would have thought of it. For this hero act will remain in memory. For Dabo even let his competitors busby take the lead and voluntarily take over the last place - by the way well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega who won this predecessor. At the end, it had nothing to do, because the busby came into the goal was just disqualified at the end of the World Light Athletic Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, had entered to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, it was at 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes." However, only in training, the best times do not count.
Million Mash: Egyptians are equipped for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible government criticisms. In the centre of Cairo, a stronger police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir square were locked.
In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls and partially searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for messages and photos related to protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opposers of Al-Sisi
During the past weekend, it had come to protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They were against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the criticist corruption and misconduct. For years, an open protest against the political leadership had not been made in Egypt. The Egyptian exile entrepreneur and actor Mohammed Ali, who played the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook for today's Friday, called for a "million marsh" at central places in the country. Ali calls for a "Volksrevolution". The man is also not "Guter" for most young Egyptians because he was a subcontractor for the army millions, but his messages came to.
The number of arrests related to the protests, according to two observers' groups, continued. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1.570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures were not confirmed at first. The government also did not comment on the figures.
Arbitration of arrests
Many people were "approximately arrested" "only because they were 'in the wrong place' at the wrong time," HRW told arresters under appeal on lawyers. The accusations against the arrests are sufficient, according to their lawyers, from "proliferation of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces surveyed and searched in Uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW claims, also arbitrary passengers.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Retailers: Dispatch dealers should be able to spend returns easier
For online dealers, many packets sent back are lost. Some 20 million returnes land on the waste. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown an online dealer like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate back-send products instead of destroy them.
Although the companies could not be excluded from the turnover tax on cheque donations, the Ministry stated that a question of the Green-Bundestag fracture, which the newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday, was so low that the dealers could put the market value of the unaccompanied returns that they would not have to pay any or little turnover tax.
Scientists from Bamberg University have found that the German citizens return every sixth package on orders on the Internet. About four percent of the goods – around 20 million products – then landed in the waste. They would spend the companies in addition to money after current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate cheque donations like a turnover that then falls on sales tax.
Green-Fraktionschef Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that businesses can assess non-coffee products accordingly and donate freely to non-profit organisations. The companies would have to rely on not being punished for donations. This was not only valid for online trade, but also for other businesses from fashion shop to construction market.
Banksy Art to Auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underscores "the rehabilitation of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic holdings of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting at Sotheby's in the British capital will be exhibited until it is to be auctioned on October 3, it is estimated to be 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of Great Britain in 2009, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exposed the painting – simultaneously with the original Brexit date on March 29th. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Fragestunde", was renamed to "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million.
Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered a tough drop-off with the opposition on Wednesday at the first meeting of the Subhause after the cancellation of a forced break by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to execute the Brexit, which had already been moved twice on 31 October, even without agreements with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, intervenes in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a mile. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when they enter the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "spaziering in the park"
The violent verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy was a "spaziergang in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy this. We are going out (from the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had hardly attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past days and, among other things, accused them of "treason" to the people. Annoying that he could threaten the Members, for example, because they could become a target of murder threats, he acted as "Humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to return to rest was if the Members would finally respect the British decision to withdraw from the EU. It is not surprising that people were disturbed about the fact that the UK had still not withdrawn from the EU for three years after the referendum.
In view of the enlarged mood on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for retention. "We should speak with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should listen."
Pakistan’s Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan again asked the United Nations to take action in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the Uno Voll Assembly.
Otherwise, a war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely to be again, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. "If this is bad, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial domination in 1947, two of them around the shared Kaschmir region. Both nuclear powers have each dominated a part of Kaschmir, another part belonging to China. In early August India had withdrawn the Indian Kaschmir region autonomy status and thus significantly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the fall of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government responds with a hard hand. With sharp ammunition shooting the population, more than 2000 prisoners were seized in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who were already sitting there. Protesting was never harmful in Egypt. However, since the power of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state device is doing everything to avoid a scenario, like at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspectivelessness and the feeling of being sucked by its own government pushed millions to the road. And this is a problem that also does not control the regime of el-Sisi, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third in Egypt lives under the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for suppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stages, produces food and much more. This was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, it will always be when many people have difficult to make themselves a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No "Showstopper" more for capital airport
Two months have been checked whether the complicated system is working in BER-Brand Protection in the interplay. The operators are satisfied with the course. But the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
Following large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is safe, said Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful test, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have a lot of detailed topics, but we don't have a real show stopper." He assured that the schedule was still buffered until the operation.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The application for construction is now to be submitted to the building office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year it was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies of power cables are still to be remedyed; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "To create the conditions for the inclusion of the flight operation, we must continue to work intensively on the processing of the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there is lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dubbles on which the cable terraces hang. The airport chief expects it to be available until the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not work satisfactory. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking barriers that run down at a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They are too far down. 36 engines must be exchanged. Then there will be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree angels as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. It was originally expected to go into operation in 2011. The costs increased from two billion from the beginning of 2006 to around EUR 6.5 billion for opening the next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has risen significantly since then, the controllers are planning to expand the airport. Therefore, it is intended to go in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the President Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial Chief Heike Fölster switches to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Staff Chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on solid feet.
Chemnitz: Automates for Drug - Police arrests man
He needed money for drugs - and hunted several automates in the Chemnitz city area! Now the offender is finally in prison!
Over the last two years, the number of cigarettes and cars in Chemnitz and the region had risen strongly. It was a million damage!
After two detonations, the police caught a 33-year-old German at the end of May on the civil road and on the further road in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations on the introduction of explosions in explosion of explosions in activity with a particularly heavy case of the theft led by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, it was not only this suspicion against the 33-year-olds".
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now stood eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the protein he apparently financed his drug dependence."Only four times the bomber had sprinkled park card machines on the civil road between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The overall damage is at least EUR 60 000!
The automotive boss is now investigating. Police investigations against him continue to run.
It seems that he was also responsible for further automation in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group embraces its strategy for the Vienna airport. In the midst of the prize struggle with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa daughter AUA "takes the commercial control of all Eurowing flights from Vienna", a press speaker of Austrian Airlines confirmed on Friday to the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" reported about it.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa-Flyer Eurowings is de facto dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. The AUA takes over from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed, which are intended to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines for holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be transferred from Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings Base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA-Dreh Cross and the network planning, explains the speaker. The flight times should be tailored to connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the turning cross of Vienna and to develop decentralised traffic from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna should only be used as a "Production Company" for the Group Sister AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight guides would be from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights launched under AUA are no longer completed in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced that the fleet in Vienna next summer would increase to 16 airplanes. The Irish cheap flyer will send four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the trade union criticized as a contour to the collective contract.
Ryanair-Chef Michael O'Leary, who will have taken over the AUA in five years, agreed on Friday AUA board Andreas Otto: "We stay the number one at the location, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) should have stopped at the beginning of the month in Italy, with his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31), which announced the palace on Thursday.
"We are delighted to be able to announce our engagement. We both are so pleased to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be actually married," said the couple, which has been together in British media reports since October 2018, in the official communication.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us very much in the coming years of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published on her Instagram account.
A royal festival
The wedding is expected to take place in 2020. More information about the date, location and everything else will be announced to the palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne sequence and the real estate mogul becomes a similar big feast as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or an attack? Hamburg researchers want to look closely at the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to get the causes of cardiovascular diseases more detailed.
The research project is the largest of this type in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation promotes the project with EUR 12.5 million. From Switzerland the Davos High Mountain Hospital belonging to the Foundation and the Zurich University Hospital.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the essential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only inadequately known, it is said. Now, the scientists want to compare the complete inheritance of 8000 healthy people with the 1,000 former patients of the Universitary Heart and Vessel Center at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4000 of the around 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-related changes in DNA - so-called mutations - from the clinic. Each year about 200 were added.
According to the five-year project, it is the objective of the initiators to develop new options such as precaution, detection and treatment of heart rate disorders, heart weaknesses and heart attacks. The data could also benefit from the research of other people's diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University of Heart and Cathedral Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney and cancer are possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong will to use the data for researching other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos has been treating allergies. Now, at the medical camp, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine was to be established and a professor for bioinformatics was created. To explain his commitment, the Swiss logistics entrepreneur said that he was operating in the open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The biological samples of healthy participants come from Hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 volunteers, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world. During the equity encryption strictly respected the protection of the anonymousized data, the scientists insured. It is a petabyte (1000 Terabyte) on data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the inheritance of a person can be decrypted within 24 hours today. The pure cost of this is 1300 euros. The first gene sequence worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study should start on 1 October, all 9000 samples are expected to be analysed at the end of 2020. In the following year, the first results are expected.
Nigerian police liberated hundreds of maltreated boys
In Nigeria, the police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a coran school. According to inhabitants, security forces searched the school in Kaduna (Northernian City) and discovered the victims, for part, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo told. "The victims were abused. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught and "better" in the Koran. Indeed, the guardians had been held by their teachers under "deserving and most inhumane conditions", Sabo said. Some hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran school had been in the past for about ten years. Inhabitants would have made the authorities aware of repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran School, Sabo said. They hadn't thought of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In most Muslim northern Nigeria there are many private coran schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed bands. According to the UN refugee aid, more than 40,000 people fled over the border to the neighbouring state of Niger over the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police freed 400 children from school
Policemen in a school in northern Nigeria have freed almost 400 students from disgusting conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that pointed to torture," said police speaker Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after an indication in a Islamic school. The conditions there were "human invaluable" and the officials took the head of the school and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were kept as slaves at their school and were placed on chains. Some were sexually abused. TV images showed deared and injured students in an apparently poor health condition.
World Football Choice: Further accusations of Messi and Klopps Short
Football "Signature Not Valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent
With a Gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa features the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he never voted in the World Football election, from other countries accusations come to the Fifa. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
Much of the Fifa has proved to be appealing in recent years: the WM grants, dubiosis plans of her president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt functionaries. However, the Fifa World Football election has not been suspected to be inevitable - if one does not look at the fact that the voted national trainers and national team captains of the member associations often voted more after sympathy than after objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconveniences now occur: Egypt complaints that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly understandable polling overview.
The Fifa apologizes in such a way that "the signatures were handed over to the electoral forms in capital letters and therefore were not valid". One had contacted the Egyptian association several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's Trainer also surprised
Even from Sudan, there is a revelation about the choice. While the situation in Egypt's case is perceiveable, the Sudanese association indicates that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote was taken as well, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanic Association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera also raised accusations: "Don't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
From the association came the message on Friday now: Stimmt, but of course it was not intention. The full election documents were "irreally" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, was imposed in a communication of the association. However, actually the second captain Manuel Rosas chose. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," said the message. Both Rosas and team trainer Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "as it stands in the official list of the FIFA".
The other cases now allow the Fifa to examine in an investigation, but stressed that the election process was supervised externally by the consultative company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi stays unconfident winner of the World Football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine affair: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two ranked Republicans have expressed themselves openly for an official investigation against the US presidents and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the US State of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this is carried out from here, the facts that are identified are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affairs before measures are taken. An impedment procedure can lead to the suspension of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the disclosures, which showed that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the democratic presidency candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden observed "since years".
The Republicans have been relieved with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, few have shown discomfort for this. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned several times against Trump's policy, for example against the halting of environmental protection regulations and the intensification of immigration rules.
As another ranked Republicaner, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the convention is now to examine the matter and to go to the ground."
Scott and Baker, as Governor of the United States, have formally no consent in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided by the Congress. Their statements are especially symbolic. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also criticized the situation. In the middle of Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". U.S. media also report that among the Republicans are taking up the internal first cracks.
The affairs could in the introduction of an official settlement procedure against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, and they are proposing power abuse for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political advantages.
There is no exact timetable for the procedure to be sent to the Office. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impediment. However, the decision on an actual official settlement fell in the Senate, where Trumps Republicans have the majority. The prospects of success of such a procedure are therefore low. To date, no US President has yet been dismissed by an impedment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Sicily, they were supposed to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 lybian refugees on board unauthorized the port of Lampedusa. After severe protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was revoked by an Italian judge after a few days.
Now new serious accusations of rackets are being loud. So three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been captured in a recording camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had re-enacted their peiners in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not even have any certain information about it," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer der Deutschen Presseagentur.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured, and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically shaken and harassed - by repeated and constant physical violence," said the message then.
NGO and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They're coming without passports," said Neugebauer. Torment is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. Therefore, it is quite likely that they are also perpetrators on the ships. "It's therefore very important that this will be followed."
Italy's former minister Matteo Salvini asked Rackete, who is still found in Italy for aid to illegal immigration, to apologize immediately.
Musk seeks delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock exchange with the view to new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100.000 deliveries," wrote Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the "Electrek" industry blog.
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks newsletter. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customership. Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
investors liked this: Teslas shares went out of trade with a plus of over six percent. So strongly the course has not been allocated for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95,000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to reach its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be made in the current and next quarter of the year. The most affordable Tesla Model 3 is demanded, but here the margins of profit are low. Despite the tree there were last losses.
US Budgetstreit: Once again only a bridge financing
The new financial year will start in the USA on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate has followed the Representative House on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump have agreed to increase the expenditure ceilings for the financial year 2020 and 2021 in August, the United States are once again without any plans before the new financial year starting on 1 October. The Senate has followed the Representative House on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, a shutdown would be made on Monday at midnight, a part of the Federal Administration. President Trump has yet to put the decision into force.
Shutdown turned off
The Federal Administration will now be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year of Monday to the end of 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 expenditure laws which are allocated to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the budgetary frameworks extended for the new financial year from 1.3 Bio. to 1.4.$.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the expenditure laws reflect priorities of the Democrats, which have little chances in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. The Senate has also reversed ten of the twelve expenditure plans more or less ready, which are barely multiplicable.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to try to force $12 billion for the construction of walls, one of the great priorities of President Trump. The Democrats disturbed the construction plans and their financing, which is intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute about the construction of walls was already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The spirits are separated in the wall construction
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue, and more likely than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of transitional financing beyond the 21st of November.
Against the background of the persistent inability of the convention to agree in time on the twelve expenditure laws, and the risk of shutdown gains ideas to automate the process of popularity. Template S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the Federal Government's financing would automatically continue at the previous year's level, stop the journey activities of parliamentarians and keep their wages back until the new annual expenditure plans are presented.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is intended to be open to single women and lesbians in the future. The National Assembly of Paris voted with a large majority for the government's law template, which allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous donations of seeds.
The presentation still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that many "children without father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which defenses health minister Agnès Buzyn as a "Chance" for society. It represents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to their idea, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women should be borne by social insurance.
Befruitment with sperm of dead husband continues to be prohibited
On the other hand, with a scarce majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which would allow widows to access the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial fertilization "post-mortem" is allowed. In Germany, in the past, there were cases in which women were in vain complaining of the release of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the ancestors in Paris argued that such azeuged child would then bear a "specially heavy fate".
Many Members of the Government Party La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and opposition members, on the other hand, had expressed themselves for artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They emphasized that a widow would be imposed on a "double grief" if the death of her husband remained unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment think it is unjust that a widow can be fruited with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner in the future.
Until now, artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heteroseksuele couples that cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had announced in summer that the body motherhood would continue to remain banned.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - yet it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation payment for the climate: calls for flight surcharge for Unis become louder
This is why the country wants to make a climate deduction there in the future. The scientists say they don't have any money for it, but now they are also under pressure.
The universities should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion on a climate debt on flights from universities and universities is again in progress before the summer break. After the national recruitment conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding pretext from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint declaration, doctorans from six bathing-wortebergian universities and a pedagogic university for a compensation of service flights, at the same time, have been called for a broad debate on the avoidability of flights. The government decision originally planned in July is still on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia takes a new festival of North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the arrested were supposed to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a change of shot between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fishermen later suffered his serious injuries. But this time there was no injured, it was said.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food deficiency. Accordingly, the North Korean fishermen were on the way in Russian high-quality waters. The coastline of Russia travels according to its own information on the protection of their sea biological resources patrols.
30,000 ink fish confiscated
During the re-checks, 30,000 ink fish were discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, the information was confiscated by three fishermen and two motor boats and brought to Nanodka and Posjet at Wladivostok.
Russia's fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year after claims from native entrepreneurs. According to thousands of fishermen from North Korea, media have already been arrested in this year.
The Chief of the Association of Russian Fishing Enterprises in the Far Eastern Region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. With these, small living creatures were also taken from the sea. Furthermore, the networks would simply be disposed of in the sea where they consumed 200 years to be destroyed.
In future only 18,000 more: USA lower asylum limits
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is disposing of seekers of protection: As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington confirms, the ceiling for the legal accession of refugees is further lowered. In future, asylum is intended to receive threatened believers and Iraqi asylum.
However, the US government wants to reduce the historically low limit for the reception of new refugees once again. In the marketing year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be left to the country, as the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained. In the economic year that is now almost expired, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to seek protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, far higher limits had been set.
The ceiling of 18,000 refugees was the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee programme in 1980. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the US as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly reminds the language use of the official US president.
A "responsible association" with refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, said Trump. For his hard course in migration policy he receives a lot of consent from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A big point of dispute is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to lock off. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a timely link between the current measure and the current internal policy developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially threatening procedure.
The U.S. government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thereby in danger, as is shown in the State Declaration of the Foreign Ministry. However, in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees should be taken up.
The US wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "northful triangle" of Central America in other countries request asylum. In this context, the United States have only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to impede the immigration at the US southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
A Orang-Utan-Weibchen has been transferred to a recording station in the United States on request of the Argentine justice from Buenos Aires’ former zoo. The "Sandra" who was born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986 was assigned to the rights of a "non-human person", so it was forced to release. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight, but not as a passenger, but in the freight room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human effece is not able to adapt to the lives in the wilderness, it is intended to live in the outskirts of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more orang-outans and 31 sjimpans, among them "Bubbles", formerly the pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before the entry in Florida, "Sandra" has to continue an about 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" in 2014 by animal guardians has contributed to the conversion of the zoo from Buenos Aires to an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education site is intended to develop to preserve the variety of species.
Record for Swiss extreme mountain climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountain climber Dani Arnold is a new Husar Ride in the Italian Alps at the almost 3,000 meters high.
Without net, double soil or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Tinne in a new record time.
Clothed with Jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness freedom, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise. So he underbaded the old bestmark by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder at the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
In spite of the trade conflict with China, the US sports producer Nike has booked a significant profitplus. The net profit increased to 1.4 billion dollars in the past quarter (knapp 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous period, as the Group reported on Tuesday. The main reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor turns directly to its customers online.
The sales increased to 10.7 billion dollars during the three-month period until the end of August. The most strongly increased the Nike sales figures with a plus of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to direct consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People's Republic.
Financial Chief Andy Campion announced that with strategic investment, Nike would continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. The investors responded to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has banned a lifelong stadium against a fan. The defendant from Brazil had been sworn by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Stolz to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has played at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on late Thursday. He reported the fan's account at Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma adherents can never visit the club's game again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in the Italian football. Regularly Italian fans scann racist insults against black players rivalling teams. "We can't have a racism in society or sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw out of the stages," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The occasion of the statement were racist songs at the firstliga party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on the previous Sunday.
However, there were also discussions about Juventus Turin's followers. The Italian authorities have now placed 38 rumor fans of record champion Juventus Turin banned. Four of them are supposed to no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed. Thus, for the rest, prohibitions of four to seven years.
The fans are in conjunction with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-favoured groups in the surroundings of Juventus. Among other things, the twelve are provoked to severe expression, money laundering and private violence. The club had rolled the investigations with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are supposed to sit behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "controlled militaryly" the ticket trade for the fankurve and should have pushed Juventus employees to get on cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennials are narcistic, the generation Z is political - all of the years are covered with tangible names. If you look more precisely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" On September 21, this call officially launched the crab catch at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also launched the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as the Department of Public Work of the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee announced.
Gaochun, which forms the southern runner of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China, and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions in ecological terms with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
People in Gaochun have already started crab farming in the early 1990s. In the course of the time, the crab industry has developed into a prominent industry that has provided high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively worked for a large, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding and technology-supported crab breeding. And the city has taken care of the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years Gaochun has progressed a reform on the distribution of power, optimization of the administration and of authorities' services, and has carefully developed the service network for "accessions under a roof, a team for criminal prosecution, a network of services, a platform for credit grants", with a view to optimizing the environment for authorisations, services and development.
Gaochun fully exploits the local benefits of connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as exhibitors to place intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedicine and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health industries, as well as companies for ecological agriculture leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time Gaochun has promoted the development of a national, comprehensive tourism area and tourist resorts of national importance. The ecological and cultural resources of the landscape of Gaochun have been integrated, the state of buildings for civil service and public service are fully improved, the areas of "Tourism +" and "+ tourism" and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level. It is rewarded to welcome the future of Gaun.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of the sanctions - Trump contradicts
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer from the United States to abolish sanctions. The United States, in return to talks with the Teheran leadership, had put an end to all sanctions, Ruhani explained on its official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian colleague on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift up the sanctions imposed against him so that there could be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had urged a meeting to take place. "And America says that I lift the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of criminal measures that should be taken to the end had been debated. "And they clearly said that we lift all sanctions up."
However, this prejudge was not in an acceptable manner, Ruhani criticized. In view of the current penalties and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure" no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquakes near Istanbul - Almost 200 postbursts
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the predecessor's occupation there have been almost 200 postpounds, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This increases the concern of a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shocked the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the million metropolis. Now the government wanted to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for trespasses, says Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself the late danger is always ignored. Every year, badly built homes crash - among other things made by the many smaller earthquakes that Istanbul regularly shake.
For years, city planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have warned that large open areas registered in the centre as refugees have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük-Bebens in August the Istanbul construction chamber had warned that an estimated million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proofed.
The epicentre of the dawn from Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the District of Silivri and in about seven kilometres of depth, as the Afad Civil Protection Authority reported. A little bit later, an even larger panic was on the streets.
The Istanbulian mayor Ekrem Imamoglu told on Twitter that there were no injuries or damages. The State Sender TRT showed people who ran out of the houses panic. Students were brought out of the buildings for security reasons in the District Silivri. Some students wept as seen in images.
Istanbul is considered particularly vulnerable. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called Northanatolic disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth Plate. Turkey is shaken again and again by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake might threaten 7,1 to 7,4. But when the earthquake comes, it is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday, it already met the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have packed so-called go-bags with all the need to stand next to home doors, and schools teach children as they have to take themselves when the earth wanders. When the next big trunk comes, be unclear.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slightly damage. The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments from the Istanbul Coordinating Centre (Akom). According to its information, two minarettes of Moscheen fell into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warnings for survival in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of panic report. Buildings wake up. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It had been stronger than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Clinic, warned from retirement via Twitter. He called the people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official information, the date of the occupation is given at 13.59 p.m. (local time). Just a few minutes after the first occupation, according to CNN Turkey, there was a post-birth given with a strength of 4.0 on the scale of judges.
It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of strength 4.6 had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to feel until Istanbul. Its epicentre was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the Afad disaster protection authority announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that provided for headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan too was hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tektonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually escape and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more probable, he said to CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to sender. "From now or later, the great tremble will come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the quake also triggered great concerns in Istanbul. In Albania there had been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also this year, the earth had been trembling this year.
Parliament: New pollutant in Ukraine
Two brilliant documents provide for new ignorants in Ukraine for possible use of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official survey procedure, the US Democrats are strengthened: The complaint submitted by an anonymous notifier on Trump and its controversial phoneat with the Ukrainian president has been awarded important evidence for investigations against the President. Trump himself sees itself once more as a victim of a "hexen hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines flight passenger locked in Toilet - Flyer redirected
Because a passenger had been imprisoned in the board toilet, a flight was redirected by United Airlines. The WC door had been blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the 1554 flight, the airline informed according to US media.
During an extra-plannary intermediate landing on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the close cabin. About an hour she had been imprisoned in it, U.S. media wrote to other passengers under appeal. To continue flight towards San Francisco, passengers had to switch the machine.
In an Internet-wide video, which is supposed to come from flight 1554, it is to see how several people try to free the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, Ma'am. We will soon get you out, okay?" says a man. The airline has apologized to all passengers. Open was first if the woman received compensation.
The Kakerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit-Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is invisible.
Inspired by Franz Kafkas famous narrative "The Transformation" wrote British success author Ian McEwan (71) a book about the Brexit Chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "The Cakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenee Verlag (Zurich) shared it. In this it is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now at once the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people and is wildly determined to let nothing and nobody stop.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment when Ministers lie unhamelessly as once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers in high positions borrowed the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only an answer to it: write." By McEwan was only appeared on artificial intelligence in the spring of the novel "Maschinen like I".
In 1915, Kafkas was published for the first time by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "to a tremendous disgusting man" and is gradually excluded from family and society and finally defeated. "Ian McEwan despises against Kafka to describe a world that stands in the head," said the Diogene Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whistle brakes to reduce noise load through freight trains. In addition, sections of railway connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna's new town and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this is to make travels more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.The funds are from the EU Infrastructure Top "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels canceled until 31.October
A day after his insolvency, the German travel organizer Thomas Cook has canceled all the journeys until 31 October 2019. Travel could "not be taken out of insolvency reasons," the company informed on Thursday evening.
This also involves bookings of Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen und Air Marin, which have already been paid or paid completely. As it is about travelling starting from 1 November 2019, the company opened. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further approach was examined.
Thomas Cook in Germany had been consulted in the sog of the plea of the British Mother Group and had submitted insolvency posts on Wednesday. The company, among other things Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Bucher travels, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer hotels immediately again
On the other hand, from this Friday onwards, hotels from abroad, which still host Thomas-Cook holidays, will receive money from the Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that vacationers are no longer required to pay extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without the submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and subject to the condition that Thomas-Cook-Reisende from these hotels will not be promptly requested or otherwise required for individual payment of hotel accounts," spokesperson Bernd Engelien continued.
The insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own information, had been forced to pay their local accommodations. Some therefore had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had strongly criticized this.
As many hotels are affected, on Friday the insolvent traveller will be voted, the insurance speaker said. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschalurlauber were travelling from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured holidays and return to the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels through the Zurich insurance only help the travellers who are still on the trip. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly until the holiday, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company informed that all travels would be canceled until 31 October. This also applies to such bookings that have already been paid.
As it is about travelling with start from 1 November 2019, the company opened up. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said. In principle, the insurance of Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and apply their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys Sprengmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued the engagement of Lady Diana. In Africa he is now walking directly on the tracks of his mother.
Clothed with a blue splitter protection west, the British Prince Harry in Angola has burned and destroyed a sponge.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trusts at the town of Dirico, he made the ignorant circle on Friday morning before running TV cameras. On a safe distance, the sprinklers exploded in the savanna countryside without any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100.000 relics of the decades of blood conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mines that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explosive champion, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to leave the way she was then going. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious mine field in 1997 had passed around the world. She also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip in the South African tourist metropolitan capital since Monday.
Staying Brexit negotiations: The risk of no-deal remains acute
In fact, Premier Boris Johnson has clearly decided: with him there will be no guarantee of a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are already in the polarising British of eternal life. The latest judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain will be canceled as a damoklesheart over the Blondschopf. His suspension of the Parliament, in order to continue its Brexit course until the date of departure, has been canceled at the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament obliges Johnson to bring a renewal of bilateral talks to the EU until 31 October.
Boris Johnson still thinks Deal is possible
But it seems that the pressure does not seem to pass by Johnson. In the meantime, when visiting a hospital, he made evidence that in the event of a non-announcement, he supported the extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we'll follow the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I am carefully optimistic that it works.
And time slowly runs Brexit handles in Brussels. The EU and the British sub-dealers still have time to prevent the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union without agreements. However, the recent talks have not reached a breakthrough again. An agreement is now more difficult to imagine by the end of October. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a re-establishment of the date of withdrawal will be in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words. She fears that Johnson may actually be able to execute Brexit in the case of a no-deal.
US Authority: Other deaths due to e-cygarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cygarettes in the USA has increased to twelve. In addition, 805 were confirmed and likely injured in this context, the US Health Authority informed CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 affected, some 500 of them confirmed. The cause of pneumonia damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in pulmonary damage has been known until now. The complaints appear to be limited to users in the USA.
The fear of new protests grows in Egypt
Millions of times Mohammed Ali's videos were divided into online networks. The Spanish builders and actors call for a "Volksrevolution". For today's Friday, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military to which criticisms of corruption and misconduct. Ali hopes for mass demonstrations with a million participants in central squares of the country.
In any case the security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Cairo, a stronger police presence was already observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets were locked around the central Tahrir square. In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls and partially searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for messages and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir square.
During the past weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. According to the security forces responded hardly. According to the Human Rights Organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were arrested by arbitrarily - just because they were "at wrong time in the wrong place", HRW shared arresters in charge of lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general ruled the country since 2013 after crashing the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Greenland Expedition back
Arved Fuchs has returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. He was welcomed at his arrival in the Hamburg port, among other things by Skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg with the race hunt "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had examined and documented the consequences of the heating on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. For years he waited for the young generation to speak. For decades, you have known that the earth is warming. Nevertheless, many were as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often happening under public exclusion," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of the heating and the irrigation of the seas. Among other things, the expedition had been measured with a drone of Greenland glaciers and was fished with networks to microplastics.
For his "Fight for Sustainable and Respectful Use of the World Seas" the Polar Researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the context of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For us all who are at the heart of the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann in the prize. "He is a witness of the changes that have occurred in the Arctics in recent decades."
Teure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for nuts 430 Euro
430 Euro for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Englishburg in Rome: that seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. Although the 80 euro drinking money was paid by the two women, they posted the payout on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Solche cases harm the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to ask whether this is a fraud," asked a spokesman of Federagit, the association of the guide in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (freeday edition).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women would not only have ordered Spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not to be taken from the invoice. Also a drink of up to 20 percent of the invoice is normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could actually have been confronted with an official survey procedure after the turbulent disclosures of the past days, the Democrats want to examine it with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is about weeks until a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phoneat with Ukrainian president Wolodymy Selenskyj is supposed to stand. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who has brought the discussion for concern for national security and for US democracy with its complaint, is demonstrative: the President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election. He has depressively exploited Ukraine's dependence and so forced them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also included in the now published co-scription of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not render the full text. However, the phone record of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the centre next to Trump is primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes its start from view of the public in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis reports travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly chosen president Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very precisely that his intentions are delicate. "We don't mix into a choice, we're mixing into an investigation of what we have the right," he says to the newspaper. You might think it's inappropriate, but "then's nothing illegal." Giuliani wants to be pursued in Ukraine investigations for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information will be very helpful for my clients and can prove to be helpful for my government."
The lawyer and former Mayor of New York seemed to have infected with right conspiracy fantasia, fixed on Trump's counter-kandidatin at the election in 2016: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at that time to construct an occasion for Russia's releases in the USA. However, this accusation was never to take seriously.
It is precisely about the investigation that Trump will speak so prominently to Selenskyj on the phone in July. The version Giulianis and the president is: The former Vice-President and currently challenging candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has pushed as a Ukrainian officer of the Obama government for the release of the former Ukrainian general prosecutor Wiktor Schokin. And, to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible by him, his son Hunter Biden was acting in its supervisory council. Biden senior has pushed Ukraine financially to conceal the corrupt powers of his family.
In fact, when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian general prosecutor should go, the investigation against the gas company was already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Schokin was also provoked deeply corrupt gestures, the US government was far from the only Western partner who urged his release. By the way, the Obama government also specifically supported the investigations against the company.
Disturbances with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances with Instagram and Facebook. Thus, mainly Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. On the website all disturbances.de users report that Facebook has not been inviting again and again since 15.30 p.m. Instagram also gives an error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disorder, although not yet in the same range.
Instagram and co. often affected by disorders
It is not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, the services had been out of place for several hours. And as in previous cases, users also take this time mainly on Twitter to make their anxiety air.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been saved from the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were travelling with a hose boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in trouble - less than an hour the Chilean rescue scrub for the storage.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean air brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m., we received the message, to get started a short time ago, and we were good 20 minutes spàter over the hose boat."
Poland has been working on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station , 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NOT charged wireless
Practical but harmful
Although inductive technology via Qi-standard is extremely practical, it should not be used yet.
Since several new smartphones have come to the market, which support wireless charging and selling themselves very well - all of them before the new iPhone 11 models, we want to call again a study of early July. Although the wireless store of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Increased temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless store of smartphones. This is, according to the findings of the University of Warwick, extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the much greater heating development. If you load a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. During the wireless loading, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees in perfect orientation of the smartphone on the charging path. If the cell phone is a bit next to the spine, the temperature is even higher. Furthermore, the watt strength of the charging pads also increases, which continues to drive power consumption to the height.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for battery durability is a decisive factor. Every single degree plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery does not only affect capacity, but it does not keep as long as a whole. So the life span is less. Therefore, the researchers recommend that the smartphone is always charged with cables. Since a battery exchange is always connected with high costs in modern smartphones, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of battery exchange even once again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is very comfortable:Simply put the device on a corresponding charging path - these are now already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is loaded without a harsh cable salad and a tiresome connector fumey. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) has a global standard, which makes it possible even to Apple, there are little restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest stove photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
According to its own information, a Nepalese climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and has thus set up a record, his expedition organizer informed.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international headlines: from him a photo of mountain climbers that are on Mount Everest Snake in the spring comes from it.
The image of the mass rank triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 metres high mountain and the highest peak of the earth. In May, 11 climbers died in the order.
A problem for Purja could become the excitement of the 14th eight thousand: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet. For example, it is called bad weather. In the early week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to enable him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a trunky elephant cow, a police speaker informed on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police speaker, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to identify the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers in whose country the animals had kept themselves harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed each year by elephants. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. The death penalty is theory of their killing.
Continuing British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas for more than two months after its arrest by Iran. According to the news agency IRNA, the Irish revolutionary warrants had been accused of disregarding rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf on 19 July.
Management of Thomas Cook in Criticism
The competent economic committee of the sub-house wants to examine the pledge of the traveler Thomas Cook. It is intended to deal with the salary packages of the board as well as with the question why the British government could not contribute financially to the surviving company. "Our interest in the company as well as the control of external auditors," said the committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "Of course we have to do so with a bad example of management desire".
According to experts, genes are overestimated intestinal cancer risk
The role of the genes in the family increased risk of intestinal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Accordingly, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) in a current study are more likely to consider the risk factors such as family diet habits. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of intestinal cancer, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) from the "Electrek" industry blog. The demand is strong so that Tesla could book 110'000 orders, but it would continue in Musks newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customership. Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
investors enjoyed the information: Teslas shares went out of the trade with a plus of over six percent. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95'000 cars and thus reached its current best value.
Musk needs records to reach its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be made in the current and next quarter of the year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
Will British government handle Brexit law? Johnson retaining
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he is looking for an unruly Brexit on the basis of the possibility of circumvention of the last law adopted by Parliament. On a corresponding question, he said only on Friday before journalists that his government would comply with the applicable right.
The law provides for the government to apply for a postponement of the date of withdrawal, no agreement with the EU should be reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a 'capitulation law' which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspicion on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political arbitration" to transpose the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that shifts the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said that he is pursuing a Treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the agreement."
Iran apparently drives uranium enrichment high
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on European contracting partners in the fight against the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "The European States show inability or lack of willingness to do with concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference at the edge of the UN Assembly in New York. In case they were not voting for their promises, he set aside "more steps" from the agreements of the intimately negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict around the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, as a counter-performance, provided the commitment to Teheran to normalise economic relations. In 2018, the United States alone rose out of the agreement to force Iran with "maximal pressure" to change the course in the aggressive Nahost policy. The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with harder conditions and now renews to severe sanctions against Teheran. Iran responded to it with a re-establishment of the uranium enrichment restricted in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used the installed centrifuges with uranium or at least prepared for use. According to IAEA statements, Iran also prepares the construction of more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore let the Iranians with the cost and load of U.S. sanctions alone, suspected Rohani. However, there will still be further discussions that hopefully have a solution.
Rohani continues Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in the mid-September, the quantity has changed: Germany, France and Great Britain followed on Monday the US estimate that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels in Yemen supported by Iran had known themselves for the attack, which was considered false by the USA. "We have nothing to do with it," said Rohani on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such accusations must provide evidence of this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders in the discussions with him during the UN General Debate did not know that the rebels in Yemen couldn't carry out such an attack as that. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past days.
Before possible discussions with U.S. President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration would first have to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He asked the government in Washington to change a policy of dialogue and reason.
Comes from other star crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the depths of the world. This has only succeeded once before. The comet allows connections to other solar systems.
At first, what was only a suspicion is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has awakened the interest of astronomers throughout the world.
On August 30, the widest comet was discovered by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeter diameter. Observations of different observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not come from our solar system.
2I/Borisov, after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017, is the second interstellal object that was seen on a passing through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get out of the vicinity of insight into a foreign solar system before it disappears to never again. First observations show that the interstellal comet is similar to that of our own systems, as the astrophysical Institute of Canary Islands reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that are around the sun," said Davide Farnocchia, for example, from the U.S. racing Authority Nasa in a communication.
According to the analytics on a so-called hyperbel track that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomic Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discovery, the interstellar sliding star, which was first led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was the name 2I/Borisov, showing the first part of the name that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers have lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has been seen in flight. Thus, the researchers remain many months for investigations. "The object will reach the largest brightness in the middle of December and then be seen with medium size telescopes by April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "Then it will only be seen with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already taken the visitors into sight. A team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, set the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometres in a first investigation. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear slip of the comet.
Researchers of the astrophysical Institute of Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar sliding star, which offers a type of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles such as comets of our solar system, and that points out that their composition must be similar," reports IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form by similar processes as in our, complemented the León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of the same two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates that, according to the IAU, these objects could open a new way to research certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such tipviss are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors might catch a planned satellite mission from the European Space Agency Esa.
The Agency wants to station the three-part "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example comet catch hunters) on a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres away from the earth. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is intended to listen to either an unaffected, fresh comet from our own solar system, or to an interstellal visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijings new Mega-Airport Daxing
Interestingly before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic, the new Mega Airport in the south of the Chinese capital is a first passenger machine of China United Airlines, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are expected to be completed annually at the new airport, in 2025 it is expected to be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s latest prestige project is also called "Sestern" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four starting and landing trains to be extended later to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to the city centre of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
During the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly declared that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany - and significantly smaller - since 2006 in the construction of Germany has been shifted again and again. In Beijing, however, a first passenger machine had landed after four years.
New oversonic plane is intended to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the UK Space Agency dreams of it. It is possible to make this flight that was flying in the oversonic period for the 2030s (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire developed, the US-Sender CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely achieve it," said Agent Graham Turnock to the broadcaster. "We speak of the 2030s for the operation, and the work has already been very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to cooperate more closely with Australians. A flight from the British capital to Australian metropolis takes about 20 hours. As so far, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the stop of its operation in 2003 and took three to three and a half hours to do so. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 inmates were killed. Last year, the US aircraft builder Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop an oversonic aircraft, which was the "X Plan". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on its homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enable the "nearest generation of truly reusable rumors".
Revocation in Washington: Trump wants to find anonymous typifiers in Ukraine affairs
Donald Trump wants to discover possible ugly places in the White House in Ukraine for possible use of power from the US president.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday before employees of the United Nations Society at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and in the past one was "a little different" than today.
This was evaluated as an intimidation attempt against tipmakers. The event was actually not public. However, several US media spread audio media from the talk on Friday. Democrats responded indignantly to the President's statement.
The Democrats in the US Representative House had announced on Tuesday preparations for an official appeal proceedings against Trump. Their accusations were mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service staff who raised severe accusations against Trump and its government centre. On large public pressure the notices of the notifier were published on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government staff that the US President "uses the power of his office" in order to achieve that another country is involved in the U.S. election in its favour of 2020.
In the centre of the accusation is a controversial phoneat between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It is about former transactions by Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his spouse from Ukrainian justice. Bids is in the race about the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with regard to the Ukraine telephonate also of the custody: executive government staff would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been made. However, after the discussion, it had been removed from a database provided for in the White House, instead of being stored in a specially protected system. To date, only a gross conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the notifier is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it should be a employees of CIA's foreign secret service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, among other things, the President wrote that the "so-called Whistleblower" had distributed information from second hand which had proved to be inappropriate. Therefore, there may not be any tippers or spies.
However, as Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have played information to the Whistleblower, rebelled. The Chairman of the US Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, responded and complained, Trump's statement underwent once more the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations against Trump and its surroundings have been carried out in several committees for months. In view of Ukraine's preambles, the Democrats are now leading up investigations with new weight in order to initiate a possible procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a schedule for our investigation," said the Chief of the Secret Service Committee at the Representative House, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, prescribed him a false presentation of things and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly shrinked ship and had asked for its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government staff from the security and external policy sector, which were mostly operating under democratic but also under Republican presidents, were present in a declaration published on Friday on the basis of the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible censorship procedure. If the accusations were true, the "scrupulous abuse of power" by Trump would be, it said.
There is no exact timetable for the further process. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual expulsion took place in the Senate where Trumps Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of success of such a procedure are low. To date, no US President has yet been uncovered by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Operations Council: Jobs are "slipping"
The VW's plans to further reduce the cost in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concerns the company council of the Autobauer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros, which are intended to save 500 million euros this year.
The "Court Pact" negotiated between companies and the Working Council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14.000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be dismantled with the autobuilder if it is demonstrated that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment assurance applies until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from business councils, jobs in production, which are not actually disposed, are "slipping" over a different way - so that they are passing off the official course. Thus, free regular jobs would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the Board of Appeal has no way to force the re-establishment. In the meantime, in many places, staff are missing to increase labour pockets, the concerns of a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would be greater. Thus, the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. By VW, it was only said: "A adjustment of the employment volume is as agreed socially contractively along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and control new projects centrally. This also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus increase competitiveness. Production board Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "In uncertain times, from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crysfest".
In this way, there are already successes: for example, this year since 2013, production costs per vehicle would be reduced in comparison to the previous year. Before journalists said that the production time for the Gulf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures for the production duration do not call VW, according to our newspaper's information it is at the Gulf 7 round
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works of Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufactured components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the rule that 800,000 cars have to be built there each year to ensure that the work is satisfactory. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only about 700.000 vehicles - conditioned by the falling Diesel demand and the problems in the conversion to the new consumption and exhaust gas test procedure WLTP.
However, as production leader Tostmann announced last year, in Wolfsburg a million cars should roll "perspectively" from the band. This is intended to make the bundling of the golf production in the tribal work possible - because Zwickau's work, through the renovation to the location for the e-auto production, makes the golf exploration possible.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales of Gulf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Gulf 8. It is intended to remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburger, despite all the efforts to build e-mobility.
Forced with Voodoo to prostitution: Human dealers condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn, swept into the Ruhr area and have been forced to prostitution. Six suspects of human dealers have to be imprisoned.
Six presumptuous people dealers from Nigeria were sentenced in Bochum on Friday to penalty for up to eight years and three months. The accused women from Nigeria had been swept into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the exilant Nigerians had had to put a ritual swore in the home before a Voodoo Priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old, with the help of libyschen Schleusers in hose boats across the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they were distributed to various boardelles in order to deal with the alleged cost of an average of 25 000 euros.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on boardel in the process. "The work made it difficult to create women physically and psychically," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the proclamation. "Some were properly infringed".
The judgments are based on commercial and tyre-inclusions of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, salaries and heavy force prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the Ufo Air Conductor Company has again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiation table, the trade union will "notify on 14 October about the labour struggle measures in the LH Group", Ufo-Triff Chairman Daniel Flohr informed on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have for months refused to conduct tariff negotiations with Ufo. It also concerns whether the trade union has legally abandoned collective agreements at Lufthansa.
On this point, after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court, Ufo is now strengthened. Lufthansa wanted to find that the collective contracts were not canceled. The Court rejected the requests. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal. "That a second court sees the matter completely different, I think unlikely," said Ufo Board Floor.
In August Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt to let Ufo's status as a trade union check.The company argued that the union had not been employed by a representative board for months and was thus unable to complete its role as a collective partner.
Previously, a strong leadership dispute in the Spartenwerk, during which numerous members of the board and the advisory board have resigned, including the long-standing trade union chief Nicoly Baublies. Ufo had been exposed to a preamble about strikes of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July because of the doubts about their leadership.
Enlightened entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is supposed to change now. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa destinations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia intends to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030 the number of international and local visitors to increase to 100 million a year, the Tourism Commission informed.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is one-historic moment for our country," said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult to access tourists. Visa is usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrims or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the erzconservative kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. After its own mission, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September several missiles and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery of the country in Abkaik as well as the Churais oil field. In the Folge national oil production drastically broke up, the oil price shoots in the height. It is likely to take several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom again reaches its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparations for wedding festival
Sänger Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for her wedding festival. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in her Instagram Stories several party photos on which she can be seen in the white wedding view.

The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. In the search there was also a military hub screwrive. The cause of unfortunateness has still to be determined. The crash site is about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European trees are threatened by extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, remote species, non-sustainable wooden beatings and the growth of cities are the causes of the threat, the IUCN World Protection Union reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them are no other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent were threatened. 66 are already at the highest risk level and thus for extinction.
The IUCN shares vulnerable species in six categories: from "potentially vulnerable" to "risk", "strongly threatened", "threatened from extinction" and "destroyed in nature" to "destroy out". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as threatened.
Eberesh and wild rhoscany threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) was threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, the German press agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by transforming or weakening their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild common roscastania. They have been considered "angered" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scala. The largest threat is the Balkan mine moth in addition to a mushroom. It has spread from southeastern Europe over the whole continent since the 1980s and has little natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild roscastania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and alone.
Slopes and moose also in danger
The IUCN scientists simultaneously created new European red lists for molluscs, bouquets and moose. More than one fifth of the molluscs and moose and almost half of all straws were threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, farming practices and climate change. Weights like snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the ground and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation for many overlooked and underestimated species is precarious, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the Europe Office. "We have to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species priority."
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 Injuries reported
The recent earthquake in Turkey has caused 34 people to be injured. Deads have not been reported. Thousands of people have had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have thus been damaged. Since the occupation of the day before, there have been almost 200 postpounds. On Thursday, the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shocked the marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the million metropolis.
Now, the government wanted to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced that Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for trespasses over the past 20 years, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly earthquake threatened. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called Northanatolic disorder marking the border between the Eurasian and the anatolic earth plate.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the strengths 7,6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicentre was at the time in Gölcük southeastern Istanbuls. More than 17 000 people died.

Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the mid-term show
The Latin Pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will run the mid-term show of the next American football fanals Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers at Twitter. "It's not bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. It's angry to stand on the super bowl bus. It's going to be in Miami on February 2, 2020.
Jennifer Lopez explained that since 1996 she dreamed of getting up at the Super Bowl - then she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the mid-term show. "Now it's more special because the NFL exists 100 years and I will perform with another Latina". She could hardly expect to show what we can do on the largest stage of the world.
Shakira pointed out in an explanation that she felt honored to stand on one of the largest stages around the world, representing Latinos and Latinas from the United States and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it is the first time that the two "Kinges" stand together on a stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents came from Puerto Rico.
Fight against lower spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American Football season. The game and the mid-term show are among the most viewed TV transfers in the USA. Even if you have recently dropped spectacle numbers: In this February, the spectacle in the USA attracted the least viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people in the meantime.
Around the mid-term show of the past Super Bowl, there had been a rebellion: In the conflict of dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 introduced the mid-term show - the criticisms were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then Quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had been on the knee during the 2016/17 season in front of NFL games in the national hymn of protests against police violence and racism. With his protest, Caepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took the gesture. This made great excitement, US president Donald Trump attacked the most of the Afro-American football stars. Caepernick itself has been unentrusted since March 2017 and has no more disputed NFL party. He prescribed the clubs not to call him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to be charged with the pledge of the traveller Thomas Cook, according to a press report. High depreciations on outstanding bonds and loans are threatened. This also affects Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in their release of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisses would probably have to make a total depreciation of up to 1.8 billion UK pounds (about 2 billion euros), according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to pay depreciation from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and buy creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually depreciated should be more likely to be at the top of the bandwidth, said an expert to the sheet.
The losses of the creditors will actually be great at the end, will show itself after the insolvency process. One of the people close to this process did not spray too much hope. For example, the 40 aircraft from Thomas Cook in Great Britain were "old" and many of the real estates were in bad situations. Most of the money could be picked out with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it continued.
Rackete is supposed to have brought suspicious killers to Italy
The Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have tortured and killed in Libya. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have any certain information about it," said the speaker of the Refugee Organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of rape, torture, and death in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the host camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They are coming without passports."
Carola Rackete had taken illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29, while a ship of the Italian financial police was ramped. On the day the three suspects were supposed to have arrived there. Against the captain, investigations are carried out for aid to illegal immigration.
United States warns Bundesregierung vor Huawei
The Chief of the U.S. Internet Authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the Federal Government against trusting the Chinese network equipmenter Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large," said Pai the "Handelsblatt" with a view to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which requires each company "under Chinese law" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The applicable right also prohibits the company from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC CEO continues, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to ask suppliers for a "declaration of trustworthiness".
At first Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "Handelsblatt" reports on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of code that change with time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "irrespective of where, it would be possible to check every single update in real time to detect safety risks," the FCC CEO continues.
He presents close contacts to the Chinese company Huawei:
The ownership relationships are transparent. The employees' company, which is supposed to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai the "Handelsblatt".
The United States suggests findings that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for discussions in Berlin to recruit for the position of the US.
Chemistry factory in North France burnt: schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemistry factory. The fire has been deleted after hours - but the cleaning can now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the north-French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's crabs remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the institutions would not open precautionally on Friday, informed the competent prefecture. The Ministry of Interior had invited the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to suspend the smoke. Injured was not there. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals in, to protect their feed and to stop harvesting first.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the removal of the smell, the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 police and gendarmen were in use at the fireplace.
A gigantic black smoke column had previously risen from the Chemistry factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of Lubricol, the additive for oil repairs. The production plant is just a few kilometres from the city centre.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations, which are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident had occurred in the Italian Seveso near Milan.
The prefection of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news sender BFMTV that there was no "high toxicity" in samples at first. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dams were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early morning at 02.40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause was first unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany has to invest now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, called on Germany to increase investments in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest and now, the earlier, the better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the euro area is weakened, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation becomes worse in order to make the necessary decisions."
The countries that would have a budgetary room for more investment would have to act, said Le Maire, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these gaps, added the minister and pointed to the high government debt of his country. This is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French government debt must be "stabilized" and "sented", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to make more public investments in order to experience the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly asked France to manage his budgetary deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides tax reductions of more than EUR nine billion for households.
The French government, among other things, responds to the protests of the Yellow West movement. The new debt is expected to decrease to 2.2 percent, as expected 3.1 percent this year.
Does he still try to trick?: Johnson wipes the question about Brexit-Tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson criticises the "capitulation law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribed to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a slippery hole. However, the Tory politician deviates on this possibility.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he wants to carry out an irregular Brexit - despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which is to prevent exactly that.On a corresponding question, Johnson just said before journalists that his government will comply with the applicable right.
The law provides for the government to apply for a postponement of the date of withdrawal, no agreement with the EU should have been reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a 'capitulation law' which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspicion on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political arbitration" in order to avoid the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure to move the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he strives to a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is that with an agreement."
Johnson's Chief Advisor Dominic Cummings said, however, that he feels the political disputes about Brexit as a "spaziergang in the park" and was confident that the desired EU exit was still attained: "We will enjoy this, we will win, we will get out of the EU, we will not worry (Announced Red: from the EU),” said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit Campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign in front of the EU referendum in 2016, now acts as a headquarters in Downing Street, British government seat. It is intended to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister to a very unforgettable situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood before the camera of Linda McCartney, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) deeply dives into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda's death in 1998 from 1969 to 1998, was proud and proud when he presented the band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrative guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Friend Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting view of the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration to the legacy of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of polaroids made it, some hundred of them are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, silent life, landscapes, several hamsters, one sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the heart: your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him.
He dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, calls in the bathrobe with a bag on the head or wears unshaped moon boats. Surely, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the light of light on her farm in southern England or Scotland also had a very normal life. According to BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had been sleeping as a baby in a bed that her father had blasted from old potato boxes. And it was not always cleared at the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera starts the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family daybook, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the decision Click: You need to recognize when a great photo happens before you, and then you have to cut it at exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you know two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift of getting the right moment always. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in Eshun-Essay.
There, the light, composition, image cutting and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only a entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to all anecdotics, is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also work as abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly laid Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was just 50 years ago.
"We will continue buying oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country despite the US sanctions imposed against Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not break oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey has problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies "retreated because of the U.S. threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will continue our relations with Iran in particular in this matter and in many other matters," said the Turkish President who repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States have been following a "maximal pressure" policy against the Islamic Republic since its exit from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran has followed a nuclear program in secret and does not follow the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran's oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have intensified significantly.
U.S. government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically reduce the inclusion of refugees. On Thursday, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that the annual ceiling of a relocation programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees at present.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the US would continue to see the support of refugees obliged, but the most important task is to protect US citizens and serve them, and the US immigration system is currently overloaded.
The US government will continue to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thereby in danger, as is shown by the State Declaration of the Foreign Ministry. However, in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, there is a maximum of 1500 refugees to be included.
With the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected throughout the world and relocated in the USA. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the currently applicable ceiling of 30,000 is a lowest. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was almost 85,000.
Assistants responded to the announced reduction of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the Chief of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would continue to damage their leading role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump tries to strictly limit immigration to the US - legally and illegally. The US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the next budget year. These numbers are separated from the relocation programme.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a tipl"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused noteers in the Whistleblower affair of spying. Anyone who has given to the informant who takes power abuse to him, "come close to a tip," said Trump, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. It reports several US media consistently.
So Trump spoke in front of American UN mission staff. When he was asked for the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial processes in the White House, he replied: "That comes close to a tip." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayed, we were doing a little different than we did now."
Observers evaluated the latter remark on a possible claim to death penalty. The Democrats exercised strong criticism of Trump’s statements and proposed him intimidation of witnesses. It is also a attempt to hinder a convention investigation into a possible procedure of office inquiry against him, the Chairman of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisor in the Representative House wrote.
The Whistleblower is proposing to the President in a now published complaint to have abused his office in order to ask for another country to enter the U.S. election of 2020. It is, among other things, about his controversial phoneat with his Ukrainian colleague, Wolodymyr Selenskyj in summer: In the conversation, Trump urged him to initiate investigations against his possible democratic publisher Joe Bide and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contests any misconduct.
However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower should be an analyst of CIA's foreign secret service.
Refugee boat known: Babies and small children drowned in Aegean
People are repeatedly trying to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece, often knowing the many too small boats. During the fall of a hose boat, seven migrants have now died, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants have died during the fall of a hose boat. Among the death victims there were also a baby and four other children, the Greek coastline reported. Four children, three women and five men could thus be saved from the flood of the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants were broken out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
From which countries the migrants originate, it is not yet known. Currently hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the East of Aegean, mostly in a lot of small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNHCR) 174 people died.
The Who Breaks Concert
A U.S. concert of the Rockband The Who has found a savage end because of an inadequacy of Leadsänger Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the appearance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston his voice failed the service. At the eighth song, Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it is still running."
Lead-Gitarrist Pete Townsend asked for apologize and supplemented that Daltrey could "not speak at all." The audience promised Townsend to come to his expense at a reconciliation concert. However, an appointment is not yet established.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who said that they should be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band colleague Townsend are the only founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Suddenly stop rental: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
WeWork is the largest office owner in New York.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from the small startup to the driving force on the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in the crisis. Renters have to fear billions of revenue.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork threatens to disturb the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had stopped founder Adam Neumann a few days ago as the boss, moved the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the leaders to win financial playroom for the coming weeks and months. Among other things, the British "Financial Times", WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect, among other things, in New York and London, the largest tenant of office areas is suddenly off the market.
WeWork rents large office surfaces in the long term and rents them in partly small units to members. This can be individual free professionals, small startups or whole departments of large companies. WeWork burns money with this business in breathtaking speed. Last year, the company launched a loss of $1.6 billion in sales of $1.8 billion. In this year alone, the rental costs are expected to have increased to be 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new business leadership is now supposed to pull the emergency brake and stop renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now completed rental contracts with up to 15 years of maturity, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could be a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for all real estate markets.
According to the economist Dan Alpert's calculations of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months almost 300,000 square meters of office space. WeWork's new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly marketed areas. Without WeWork's expansion, the office space in the U.S. metropolis would have increased at this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". Similarly, in London, WeWork is now in the best position for several dozen office locations.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could be veiled without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main landlord, last year in a office house purchased by the Sparkassen-Fondsanter Deka for almost 100 million euros in the centre of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their real estate for WeWork's requirements with high investments. WeWork does not make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would have to write down some of the expected billion revenues. Access to the WeWork's reserves, however scarce, do not, despite the long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by extra-founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only in close limits.
Russia again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken place against North Korean fishermen. Over the past days, a total of 262 wildlifers who had been illegally fishing in the waters have been arrested, the Russian domestic secret service FSB reported to the Interfax Agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested, before the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it was said. The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were thus on the way in Russian high-quality waters. The coastline of Russia travels according to its own information on the protection of their marine biological resources. During the further checks, 30,000 ink fish have been discovered. In addition, the information according to three fishermen and two motor boats has been confiscated and brought to Narodka and Posjet at Wladivostok. According to the Agency Ria Nowosti, the Coast Guard Station in 2018 has established more than 8,000 violations.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans after claims from native entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there in 2019.
The Chief of the Association of Russian Fishing Enterprises in the Far Eastern Region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. With them, small living creatures would also be taken from the sea. Furthermore, the networks would simply be disposed of in the sea where they used 200 years to be crushed. Also, the ships themselves do not represent the hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow's three members of the Russian Coast Guards were injured during the arrests in the previous week. According to the FSB, a wounded North Korean later died of his injuries. On that September 17, Russian border guards first fixed a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened the fire.
United States ban on entry against ex-President Castro
The United States has opposed former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children's entry bans. The American Ministry of Foreign Affairs founded in a communication on Thursday with Castros participation in "great violations of human rights". As head of the Caribbean Caribbean Party, he was presenting a system where thousands of Cubans would be arrested randomly and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As Chairman of the Armed Forces, Fidel Castro, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader, was also guilty of human rights violations by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crisiss on Cuba and in Venezuela", the American foreign minister Mike Pompeo twittered.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had banned entry, among others, against members of the Venezolan government and the military. In Venezuela, a bitter force between the government and the opposition has been tormented for months. The US has imposed a number of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him into the knee and help the opposition leader and self-represented interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of dispatched doctors. According to the US and the Venezolan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government to oppress government opponents.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go on the road for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the movement of Fridays for Future plans to re-establish actions and explosions in dozens of countries around the world. The beginning is expected to be New Zealand and Australia, before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large demonstration in Canadian Montreal. Also before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather.
The size of the worldwide commitment on this Friday after the recording of the pre-week will be relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people have stretched for the climate. This Friday we make it once again!" she wrote on Twitter. To date, in the framework of the strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
A good third of all world demonstrators - around 1.4 million - were involved in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates of Fridays for Future. This time, a list of the movement has been planned in at least 65 cities. Among them, in Metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go to the road for the climate.
At the age of 15 at that time, Thunberg had been in front of the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 in order to call for the politicians of their country to make a stronger use of climate protection.In a short time, the Friday-for-Future movement was created. In particular, students and students participated in climate protests, but also scientists and other adults are increasingly involved.
Together, they demand more ambitiousness from politics in the fight against heating and the threatening climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming has to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial time.
Thunberg had arrived just a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tournament with a high-sea racing yacht in New York, where she had recently participated in the United Nations climate protests and summits. On Monday she held an emotional speech with the UN, in which she was persuaded to the heads of state and government of the earth. In her hometown Stockholm she was addressed on Wednesday for her efforts to protect the alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation for climate protection.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman of the Department of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow to the Agency Tass. The ban is intended to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who still smokes must therefore expect a penalty of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should dispose of a fire, then the penalty will fall higher. According to the ban, the Ministry also has burning candles. Also to grill meat spit on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Schlag gegen cybercriminelle - Detectives lifting servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time lifted a large server provider for illegal businesses in Darknet.
A total of 13 offenders are suspicious of hosting numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel, using the internationally acting criminals.
This was notified by the General Prosecutor in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested in a large action on Thursday evening. The Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Among other things, customers of the suspects are to have been the operators of the world's second largest darknet marketplace for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which had been cut off by the agents in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million Telekom router at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the cyberbunker, according to the general government attorney.
Such a host had been lifted out in Germany for the first time. A web host provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and in neighbouring abroad. It has been the result of nearly five years of investigation. In the afternoon, the investigators want to inform more details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go on the streets for more climate protection.
In order to conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement re-established actions and explosions in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland in Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large demonstration in Canadian Montreal.
Climate-protest ← Who are Thunberg's back men?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. As surprisingly, a 16-year-old girl will keep the humans of power from the nose. But what is behind? Is it helpful or wise to market a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg moves the masses and brings young people to raise up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man can gain a gathering of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt awesome to use for a fairer world. At that time, he has also been able to win a schar of young people for himself and persuades to cross the sea to reach the praised country, similar to Greta Thunberg has recently made himself on the journey to America with a sailboat.
But there is a shadow side in this regard?Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? Furthermore, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. Besides, her mother has published a book that has sold far-reachingly thanks to the daughter standing in the Rampenlight. Also old-written followers of Greta Thunberg were a little distrusted over the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too big. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into the media worldwide very well and it flows much money thanks to the imposing action.
Here, the spirits are now separated: Is it morally right to enrich financially in the world's betting? Is it still authentic if some people circles work together during the world's rescue action with stock exchange agents? No matter what position is ultimately involved, a critical and reflected point of view is always more important in a democraticly shaped society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. That is why it can also make sense to question seemingly tough projects from certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The astronomers' suspicions have confirmed: A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment - he is only the second of his kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in the Crimea
The said body was discovered by a amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of his kind that was seen during the passion.
The great chance for astronomers is now to have some insights into a foreign solar system from the vicinity. Obviously, the comet resembles our own system, as reported by the astrophysical Institute of Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomic Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellary origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic track that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before approach - and can be observed several months
But before it is so far, the astronomers can observe him in detail. In contrast to its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be examined from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the largest brightness in the middle of December and then be seen with medium size telescopes by April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Authority Nasa. "Then it will be only with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First Insights on Comet 2I/Borisov Awakens Hopes in Science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be like our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the swap star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves through similar processes as in our, complemented the Leóns colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two of these objects have already been discovered within only two years, may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids repeatedly employed the researchers. Just recently a giant asteroid ran by the earth and came dangerously near her.
"Absolutely disgusting": Rachel Johnson disgusted by brother
To Boris Johnson it becomes lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister pests with clear words the warrior language of the Prime Minister as "delicious". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson stands under pressure and continues to equip - at least verbally. At the questionnaire in the underhouse on this Wednesday, this was a massive embarrassment of the opposition, and now more critics have reported themselves: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author said to the sender Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, long-drawn, four-partyed, deceived, and fed". They think that this is quite disgusting. She does not recognize her brother's version again, said Rachel Johnsons, who had joined the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit "Change UK".
Especially, her brother Jo Cox mentioned, an EU-friendly sub-house member who had been murdered a few days before the exit referendum in 2016 by a Neonazi. The best thing to do is to honor her thought by passing through Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the underhouse. "It is very tasty to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," he criticized Johnson's sister. The offender was obviously coming from the right-hand extraordinary camp that "this kind of language" strengthens. For all those who mourned about them, it would be very tasteless.
The widow of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used so," he twittered. The best way to honor them was, if you were passionately and determined for what one believes - no matter what view you are. But never should you "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in the attacks had become more probable.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had laid down his office as a state secretary and his mandate as a Tory member. "I had been broken between loyalty to the family and national interest in the past months - it is an insoluble tension," said Jo Johnson.
Johnson's language was also in the Church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and Archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that "this country is not worthy of" was not acceptable. In a common statement they said: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside the Parliament, was not acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear at the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: In the mid-term show of the next Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear. They promise "a explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the next finale of the US Football-Liga NFL, which announced the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira told in a video.
The final of the American football liga, which celebrates its 100th birthday in the next year, takes place on 2 February in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is parito-rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had been migrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as a actress and is seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November to November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She created her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first two-speaking album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the mid-term guests is expected every time in the USA with tension. This year many are also selected as a political gesture. Finally, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and Rolling Stones provide for Furore. Usually, the NFL finances look widely over 100 million television viewers, it is now very popular in Germany.
Last year, there was political controversy. The reason for the conflict about the Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused from protest against police violence against Blacks to raise himself in the playback of the national hymn and, among other things, had been attacked by US President Donald Trump. From solidarity with Caepernick, some musicians had rejected a super-bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The rock group Maroon 5 was finally criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber add Egypt's ruler: First, Mohamed Ali is staying abroad.
The two men who have influenced the flow of blood on the streets of Egypt have spent the last week both abroad. One of them went back to Cairo Airport on Friday. State President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former General, who in 2013 praised the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected Head of State of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: the US president Donald Trump had pledged Sisis action against political Islam and no silbe of human rights violations on the Nile – in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they dared to protest against the presidents. He had "no reason to worry," said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of the state reputation. "The Egyptians are not allowed to go into the errors."
The President of the other man, who is currently devising the events on the streets, is trying to lead to a mistake. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he withdraws from the access of the security forces that would immediately arrest him when he tried to enter Egyptian soil. weeks ago, the 45-year-old as actor was known only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tonninous voice that controls the political discourse in the cafés, the living rooms and the teestubs of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Mysteries", Ali calls his landmen to raise up against Sisi.
He goes directly and in quite rustic language to the head of the state. While the people hunger, the president swells in luxury and let her build new palaces, it says. The army leadership, on which Sisi is based his rule, provokes Ali corruption and enrichment. Because he has been in his second profession as an entrepreneur for 15 years with exactly these masters, he seems to know quite precisely what he is talking about - that is at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the rightly exploding click numbers show.
After the first week Sisis Griff had demonstrated thousands of people against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested for this Friday, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. That really so many people would wage on the streets was unlikely. But there were to separate smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the town of Kina at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests whose participants claimed corruption and demanded their exit. In these protests, the police also introduced teargas and rubber shots. These videos were not independent.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrators last week ran banner with the president's portrait, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the outbreak streets. In Cairo several subway stations in the city were closed for maintenance work in the city, most streets around the Tahrirplatz, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on the Rabaa square, on which in 2013 followers of the crashed Muslim brother Mursi, until the army took them fire and killed them up to 800 people, another measure should prevent dissatisfaction: Sisis future party wanted to hold out here a large announcement for the president.
Mohamed Ali caused these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us get in touch with police officers." However, as a withdrawal, it is not to understand: "Great Egypt is the Tahrirplatz".
When the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than the provider, there are various testing options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not need to blindly trust the provider's speed specifications. Customers can, in case of accidents, verify how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, explains consumer central Bavaria.
If the connection seems to be much slower than the provider, there are different testing options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"The providers' tests, however, are carried out according to specific requirements and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," states consumer central Bavaria on their side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days to the provider in order to make the promised performance. This is the best in writing by means of a subscription.
If this does not affect anything after multiple requests, customers can cancel and may also demand damage. However, in the end of success, only the way of action helps.
First ranked Republican for Investigation
As the first ranked Republicaner, the Governor of Vermont has expressed himself for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it is carried out from here, is determined by the facts that are identified," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the Whistleblower affairs before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the suspension of the President.
Scott said that he wasn't surprised by revealing that Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions from the democratic presidency candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. For Trump observed bids "since years".
Republicans have been relieved with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have been disapprovaled for this. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy several times, for example, against the cessation of environmental protection regulations and the intensification of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man remains in MCU: Next Marvel-Movie
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate paths in the future. Tom Hollands Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers"-Universum. Completely unclear how it should continue with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives a further final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home", which reports several US media consistently. Accordingly, the cinema start is to be established: the film will start in the USA from 16 July 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am glad that Spideys' way will continue in the MCU. I and all at the Marvel studies are very pleased that we can continue working on it ... He is the only super hero with the ability to play in different universities, since Sony continues to work on his Spidey version. You never know what the future will bring."
But what happens to the sudden good news? Sony Marvel should have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the group Disney, to which Marvel also belongs, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
So Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finals
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the United States has now reached the large finale. In the last episode, there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been involved in the series for many years, was invoked in a charming manner. Attention, the following sections include spoilers to the series finals.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives again showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of failure and the happy wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his detention.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned at the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just went to the Altar to marry his promised Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a plenty of remarks about his suit. Whether he really has overwhelmed a walk, Harvey wants to know of the bridegroom, just to notice: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
Egeis: Baby and four more children drown at boat crash
At the end of a refugee boat in the Aegean, a baby and four more children were drunk. Overall, in the accident seven people died, as the Greek Coast Guard said on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat dropped near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey have passed over to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNHCR) 174 people have died. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that both countries want to visit.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wanted to inform in Turkey about "the situation of refugees," said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens to help cope.
On Friday, a spokesman of the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip Seehofers with the EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister of Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people were transferred to the Greek islands, said by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The rising figures have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come illegally across Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for any Syrian who is disfellowshipped.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult for the lack of staff on Greek sides. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, are at least 29 400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: In a camp with capacity for 650 people, there are currently 5200 migrants.
It has never been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, reports the State Radio.

Especially, people with heart cycle diseases, older people and diabetics are affected.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photography
The Chief of Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, was manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multiway cup in hand on a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It's quite unnoticed - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw has never held hand on Elizabeth May, the head of Canadian greens. On the party's website, she was seen on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also spread to the media - and there was still a cup (Papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green chef has to be responsible for photopanne
The National Post then proposed May manipulation and that the Party of Fake News produces in order to appear more credible in the subject of "Environment Protection", and that in the middle of a election campaign to the sub-house election, where Trudeau also has increasingly difficulty because of a bribe scandal.
The photo was viral in the social media and took the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a contrast of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their cups".
May was shocked and regretted on her blog to have nothing to know of this action. To underline this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she put it right, she was from Bambus. She always did it. A spokesman of the party said that it was only about putting the logo of the party in the image, and not to hide something. From the photo is only a cut out on the website.
May writes, it's her suffering for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said to the Guardian, and at the same time asked something about her exaggerated team: "If they want to do a picture again, they couldn't do something with my face, so that I look younger?"
The German greens have also been shot because of their use of aweg plastic or flight trips in Shitstorms - but their pictures were not photographed. Thus, the chief of Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, eats on vacation ice with plastic slippers, as note.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It was said that Jaqueline Ng had been assured by Cathay Pacific via mail, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to fly on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan gets an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they have luck, and the employees at check-in offer a change from the Economy Class free of charge.
However, this case shows how to not do it: A self-declared influencerin has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Instagram follow Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she fled back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the flight, the employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although she showed an e-mail in which their Cathay Pacific claimed to have upgraded. The letter wants to have received the influencerin from a marketing co-worker of the airline. On the other hand, the airline accuses Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried to get an upgrade for the longitudinal flight. This time, the woman should have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they hacked at the central. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail is supposed to come, the mail contact with Jaqueline had disagreed. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the Influencerin turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencerin fraud has committed, it remains blocked for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also say that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to satisfy it - and now turn on an attorney.
Oil prices according to the report on the ceasefire in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Lastly a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea range Brent 61.83 US dollars - approximately 1.4 percent less than in the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
A report from the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia was supposed to have approved a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had caused five percent of the global oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels in Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had declared the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia is responsible for Iran as the US government.
If an agreement is actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand care, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Material Strategy Department at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices continue to move down in the past days. One week ago a barrel WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Lastly, Bloomberg, under appeal on Insider, reported that repairs in oil plants in Saudi Arabia are progressing faster after the attack in mid-September than planned. Thus, the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and move back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there were several press releases under appeal on Insider, which report from rapid progress of the Saudi Aramco State Oil Group in repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to plan a stock exchange and avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, a bit of relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries suggested: The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently released release on the way to leave the harbour. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship was further in front of Anker, told editor Erik Hånell to the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the United States announced to move defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian Architecture enemy to Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and Great Britain had temporarily driven oil prices to the height in the past weeks.
Protests against Trump intensify
In the affairs of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, there have been no doubts of custody against the White House. Several leaders of government have tried to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a conflicting phoneat between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. That said an anonymous notor. The spokesman of the Representative House, Democratic Nancy Pelosi, explicitly foressed the White House of Confusion. Trump spoke of an "hexenjagd".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim as questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that there will soon be a third summit of power officers Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and success prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said Spitzendiplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA Agency.
So far, the US had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, the consultant of the North Korean Foreign Ministry said. He also criticized US sanctions and the US and South Korea's common military maneuver. He hoped for a "wise" and "mutige" Trumps decision to bring it back to an approach.
On Monday, Trump said that he wanted to know what a third summit should bring with Kim before he was ready to explain. The negotiations on a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been in Hanoi since the failure of the second summit of Trump and Kim in February. In June, both of them met in the demilitariated zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the discussions but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers are supposed to help mine cleaning
With a blue splitter protective west, the British Prince Harry in Angola symbolically exploded and destroyed a sponge. Near a camp of the British Halo Trusts at Dirico site he made the ignition circle. On a safe distance, the exploring body exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola free from mines until 2025, he later asked for running TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but have not helped to make up for help."
Pounds under pressure - interest reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In view of a short-term interest reduction, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations to a short-term interest reduction of the Bank of England (BoE) add to the pound of Sterling. The UK currency was billed by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The sales triggers were statements by the note banker Michael Saunders. This brought a lower interest rate to the discussion, even if a chaotic brexit could be turned off, since the insurance would affect the British economics at an absurd time. This statement is surprising, since Saunders had been defended by a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens for the economy through the Brexit Hickhack without signaling direct interest reductions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson would also want to lead his country without a divorce agreement from the EU on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has received a high risk, but it could pay out for him, says commercial magazine editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity of the Light Athletic World Association.
As a result of the light-athletic WM, new details about the Doping Scandal in Russia are presented - and they destroy the few of the credibility of what Russian sports had recovered at the beginning of the year and also used. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: they were falsified.
In December 2014, a systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sports. The Wada had blocked the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During that time Russian sportsmen were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee reads about 270 athletes of the country under neutral flag at the 2016 summer games in Rio, 168 Russian sportsmen and athletes were at the start of the winter games in February 2018. Also in the World Cups in the various sports games, they were allowed to participate in the summer of Russia, even the football WM with the host.
Missing Positive Found
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada bann again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should give information about the extent of the intuition of Doping cases in the state doping. They should help to punish athletes and athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Light Athletic World Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping Data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory have been manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurt General Zeitung" of Friday. "We have found a lot of discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a Whistleblower, and those who received it from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing in the McLaren report.
The WM does not affect
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Light Athletic Association holds as the only organization at the Bann of Russia. At the WM in Doha 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, Wada had already put manipulations into the room and requested Russia to answer the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the re-locking of Rusada and in the worst case also exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
