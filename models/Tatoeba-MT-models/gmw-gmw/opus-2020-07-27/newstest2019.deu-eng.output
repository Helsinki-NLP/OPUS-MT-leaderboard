DFB-Chef Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question, of course, depends on the fact that one gets to talk to him about why he seemed to have felt this as it was laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung".
Despite the now monthly debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had played further for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be so up to some time," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had explained his resignation from the DFB team in July and also reasoned that Grindel had not defended him against racist oppositions during the WM.
The DFB-Chef repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from the soccer so that if "one leaves a team or switches a association that one talks about it with his coach and I find it awkward that this conversation has not been achieved so far".
Linz: Garden cottage burned in Schrebergartensiedlung
At 14.13 p.m. Linz was alarmed for a fire in the Angerhofweg.
Because a high voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergart settlement, danger was in delay.
The occupational firefighter went out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be practically removed from the gins and cleared fire bulbs in the absolutely necessary size.
According to the owners of the burning garden house, he had mounted a battery to store at noon.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, the charger, according to fire gun, was in the area of the largest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined, as well as the cause of fire.
However, he is likely to be significant because the owner had many collectors in his garden house.
Angry mother fights: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open streets
What only led Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to attract the children to a alleged refugee family.

When the family flee from the actress, Lohan persecutes the parents and their children.
It refuses adults to trade in children.
For all this, she doesn't give any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this right," Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently she tries to separate the children from her parents.
However, sometime the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan misses an ear fig.
Under tears, the actress regrets how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently totally unclear.

"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meant Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood is divided into the country.

Audi: "Dieselgate" workout lasts longer than planned
"The Diesel-Taskforce is still there," said the development board Peter Mertens on the "Autoweek".
In December 2017, the Audi Chief Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/drive combinations were expected to be tested," he said at that time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage goal in the process of this crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the Dieselcandal at the Audi-Mutter Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car builder has made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal never again occurs.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and would like to continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities propose that the Audi Chief have approved the sale of diesel cars with false exit values after the notification of the gas fraud.
He knew of the manipulations or consciously ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot, Sales Officer, is headed by the company as Commissioner Chief.
Because of the conversion to the new standard of exhaust and consumption checking WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schott the "Heilbronner voice".
Basically, he sees a decline in demand for limousins such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot is putting on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives to re-election - Lahm is supposed to be in the DFB presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the WM-Aus und Özil-Affäre, wants to again be a DFB president for the office next year.
"I'm doing my work and trying to do it as well as it's going," said Grindel as a guest on the early Sunday morning at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio".
You have to try again and again, I'll do that.
And then you have to look at whether the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association finds it "notic" if he would not have "joy to cooperate in the future project" after the grant for the EM 2024.
Grindel has been Head of Association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach crashed over the summer fair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for the first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held on 27 September 2019 at the DFB-Bundestag.
According to Grindel, the future EM Chief Organisator Philipp Lahm is to cooperate in the DFB presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that in this role he will also be advised in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, warmly invited to provide his experience in sports matters," said Grindel.
In speculations, whether Lahm could become his successor as a DFB chef, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that a national player without migration background should become DFB's integration messenger.
Currently, this office of the born Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person without migration is clearly involved in society and football and says, "the topic is important, we have to take care of," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the spot where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Correct decrease with semi-wise scale
I have a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight but also the body fat content.
Muscle and bone mass can also show it.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is rather for the worst.
He doesn't tell anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscles.

Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened thisib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Earlier, Erdoğan had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day visit.
Criticism to Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver live members of the Gülen movement in Germany and to deal with Kurdish Separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathisants of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.

Several thousand policemen were in use - among them also sharpeners.
The Islamic Association Ditib stands in the criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and horror
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have acquired more commitment to fighting poverty and disease at a joint concert in the New York Central Park.
"Engage you wherever you can only," said Mendes at the festival at the evening on Sunday, about 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm silent, but it's okay, because I'm here and willing to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and Assistants were also shown in the multi-hour spectacle on stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a horror when many spectators thought the noise of an umfallend metal locking for shots, got anxiety and tried to flee.
In short, panic developed, people ran across each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York Police and the musician Chris Martin then calm down the people from the stage.
"Nobody's trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all in security.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" group were available free of charge every year on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to kill had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were jubels and applause calls for the Republican senator Jeff Flake, on the other hand.
Although he spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons at the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had expressed himself in the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of board Kavanaugh as judge at the Supreme Court and thus pushed many women off the head.
At least three women have raised abuse prerogatives to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which rejects it.
Flake called for a FBI investigation of the accusations after two women who have experienced their own indications themselves faced sexual attacks on the way to the committee meeting in a elevator.
"You can also enjoy meeting in a elevator with me at any time," Flake said at the New York concert for a spectator.
Press Freedom: Federal Government defends the journalist's raid
Government speaker Steffen Seibert has defended a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom of Journalists" and went to the first row.
The T-shirt, hadn't been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the expiry of the press conference.
The reporter's action has caused a strong disturbance, which is not acceptable.
That's why he caused human guards to bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor Office.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, numerous journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or fethullah wave movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failure of the coup on July 15, 2016.
Some of the protested journalists threaten several decades of imprisonment.
Also foreign journalists are not safe in front of the Turkish authorities: First in the beginning of September, Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had provided attention.
Although they came free and could return to Germany, they still run processes against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-looking his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look there twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for moisture conversations at the Theke of the Hamburg port kneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller stirs with her guests on some beer, some wine or also more high-percentage beverages to lure the mood and tongues.
Not a few promis also drink courage for compulsory vocals.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Greatest Day".
The Münchner did not get the excursion to the high north at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely screwed on it, the eyes only two little slits.
The bed-selfie shows a completely lauded florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he has only a powerful cater.
To his fans, he posted some - not quite seriously common - insights that he has now won: "Reel one: NOT go to Inas night.
Rule two: Don't drink the black sauce.
And syringe.
And the round of egglicor, which ina melts around half three, let's go.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the retirement.
They ranged from instant breeze, fish breeze or - probably the most targeting - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the usually attractive cinema.
As Ina Müller has survived the nightly surgery, it is not yet known.
Since she has moderated the TV-spacing at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and unrat
The entrance to the 36 kilometres long railway route in the Red Cageland in Treysa presents itself hardly found and wasted.
Recipes against grassing vandalism are searched, but solutions are hardly different.
Shears, cigarette chickens, waste and unrat, demolished trash and now disassembled signs - so since longer time the entrance has been presented with the seating group to the cycling path on the hate hook in Treysa.
For the showing object railway route in the red cageland a more than awkward sight.
The topic has been employed by members of the AFFC local group Schwalmstadt, but also by others, according to the cycling officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Council on cycling.
There isn't a solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the movement of the seat group to the regular disposal of the waste tanks and cleaning of the area at the starting point.
"I think the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Desertnhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic was also included in the local council.
Not only the waste drives cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting point on weekends for celebration.
It is not only a lot of loudness, but in the layers it is also destroyed: pissed out of the earth, trash demolished, shields collapsed, seating furniture smashed.
Volunteers had already been cleaning up more often, tells ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the pronounced drops on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the Rastplatz on the Radweg in Treysa is a meeting point for sailing.
"Belonging the entire cycling path, here at the Hate Hill is clearly the focus," the cycling officer confirms, who now also cares for the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same destiny, it'll be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "The threshold may be significantly higher to understand common goods.
However, this would presume that a police strife will pass soon.
Basically, desertnhagen wishes to develop the hate hill.
It has to be more attractive.
The frequency of the cycling path so far could be very satisfied.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bicycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says the AFFC members.
As an extremely critical hazard station, ADFC member Susanne Klipper estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turtle on the hate hooks.
In the case of rainy traffic, it may happen that cyclists have to wait on the street between both sides of transport," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music-Contest at the Cultural Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music competition was a success, creative and in co-operation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district-offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Competition for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A competition "with eyedrinkers in the sympathic Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family membership with coffee and cakes from the honorary officials of the Cultural Railway Station.
Seven formations arrived, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-life albatcher living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper star colors", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the children's garden Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Blackies.
This contest, according to District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't experienced this in other parts of the city yet.
What were the texts related to?
In the villages the Hiltrup lake and the market halls were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig shortened the mere in his sleeve-like song to the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Cultural Railway Station was also recognized.
Again and again it was about the experience of fellowship in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke experienced the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the artists or instructions on their creation.
That's how one learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitars.
From the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has, in the meantime, placed everything on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltrup gastronomy.
For the jury's favorites there was something special - so others can also hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Himig with his Hiltrup camp, who particularly impressed Frank with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "A very nice appearance" with ten children and two tutors on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children came to the final again - and even without electronic support sounded "just well", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, inaccessibility of the melody and recognizable.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the District Office.
The district offensive had launched the event from the occasion of their ten years of existence.
She valued the event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams sitting opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen screen, in which four cards with keywords that can be deciphered - the old trick with the red slide - only when you put it in.
Thus, it is ensured that the opposite is not able to read anything from a mistake.
On the cards, for example, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd cubes.
4th festival.
These are the terms that it is now to encrypt.
Because it is not to be advised here the terms, but codes.
A different player per team is the encryptioner.
He gets a code card on which might be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" it is to be advised, not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: In this order and in this example, he should describe the terms "worm", "fest" and "window" in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team isn't as possible; because that is why the game wins when he manages to knack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads loudly: "Whip" for the cubes, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; of course, here would also be something like "Party" possible and "Prag" because he has watched in the school and knows the window tower there.
This is how it goes for rounds, team for teams.
Although you don't know the terms of the opposite, it can get together with any indication that the encryptor gives there better.
It may be mysterious, but not too dismantled, so the descriptions should be so, otherwise it is unnecessary to make it hard to his team.
The most cryptic to "decrypto" is unfortunately the regulator.
The competitors probably have to study it quite long and extensively until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But the one who has once released will be fascinated with how much feeling is in this seeming game.
Overall, however, "decrypto" is not as lussy as predecessor and Genre-primus "codenames", which also has a agent theme to play less words, but much better to play in small groups.
And whoever is consulting and not about victory points, he can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harasses guests in the Kneipe
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday as double.
He first showed the Hitler Greeting in the Upper City of a passing police tire, and later he also fell in the Upper City in a kneipe when he harassed other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized the place reference given by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection of Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In the nervous state, it must also be responsible for the use of signs of non-constitutional organisations in criminal law.
Company Pressig was home to the Schublocks
For decades, the train station in Pressig was the turnslide in the Frankenwald.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffer kneeled at buffer, it was heard in all pressy," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the railway station.
That didn't give up anybody.
Then the brakes also quieted and knattered the cars.
That was pure railroad.
Pronunciative statements for Dinkel's homeland are pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald a place was characterized by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep-rampe mountain track to the north, which has its shit point in Steinbach on the forest after an increase of about 220 metres.
To handle this, former train and shoe blocks were needed that had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a train station with 21 locoups, teaching workshop, driving and railway championship.
"The heartpiece was the film that had a 18-meter diameter after a reconstruction in 1899," explains Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historians and 47-year-old professional trainers.
The train station (BW) Pressig, which was built in 1968, also operated locounts for the subways of Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - north.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported about a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electricization of the route 1939 has already minimised the need for train and shoe blocks.
From 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weighs were ranked a month.
In 1982, parts of the company were canceled, 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not taken a better use of the site, even in the transport of goods."
Even on Pentecost 1989, the Railway Directorate Nuremberg celebrated the anniversary "50 years of electricityification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" a pumpy station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic viewers here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
It's a little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the ranking station Pressig was history.
"The ranks and shoesmen made the most difficult work in train traffic," thinkel recalls.
Every mistreatment would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen Train Station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with upset success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbleddon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against Francis Kristina Mladenovic.

The swab now gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened in the context of the series "Art and Genuss".
With great relief registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoors of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It will take place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Rund um Walberla" in the series "Art and Genuss".
It opened its gates in the 15th year.
A great visitor's appeal showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as a major organizer and artist.
Something surprisingly, but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven, young hands with good future perspective.
In the past, both have already actively participated in the selection of artists and have contributed to Flyer.
This year too, on the occasion of Art & Genuss, there is again a 70-cent special brand designed by them, available at every art station.
There, too, this year's poster can be purchased for eight euros "betzn out" by Volker Hahn.
Hahn was pleased with the great consent of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler could be won from Nuremberg for the musical renaissance.
When walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windplay Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playful.
They are made of metal or ceramics, often equipped with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stamp, brightened in color, playful with 20 wind wheels, 24 hips and 24 alu tubes as a sound piece.
With the lightning sun in the background through the bushing work, the object works fairly and invites you to stay.
From Eckental, Barbara wash neck comes, which is preferred in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years of K&G.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
On half a route, Siegrid Frey from Eckental issued her work "The Wind the heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, people of Hahn show his colorful imagination of cement, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windplay Performance" for the slumber through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albanians: singers celebrate 50th birthday festively
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also made their distress air at that time.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to find out partout that after the resolution of the Church's choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more Sanges life in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albanians from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated great in the "house of meeting".
"It's going to be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep justice.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albanian singers.
They had renewed the foundation festival for the anniversary.
For years it was tradition, then there was only a break.
The festival of tradition was positive to the 50-year-old.
An elegant ball was asked for festive clothing before.

Fullyball: 3. Liga Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The riser is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the control of Axel Büring is right in Liga three.
No trace of shit or fracks, the Independents make their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee quite good.
"That wasn't glass clear, but we have already left impression," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately joined this: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We're not satisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a post-birth festival of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good to cut off the game.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a setball.
"If they're bringing the goal, such a game can kick once," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with his routine forces and brought the full exploitation into the goal.
"All of us are aware who stands on the other side in such a Derby.
That doesn't break us the neck.
I saw the right full-eyball phase," Annacker did not hesitate with the 0:3 - and went to the agenda immediately.
Where the journey is going for the Independents, after just three days of play does not seem to be predictable.
"For this it's just too early," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3. league has an incredibly good level.
With Regionalliga Volleyball, this is not almost comparable.In the fourth League, they do not want to turn their view down.
If the West will not be defiled in the next weeks, they will have to look up.
But a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday it's just going to Emlichheim.
Aasee takes place in Essen on October 14th.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Traumschiff" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly talks about that the series could have had a co-debt in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of the Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018 she went forever off board.
The series she made to become the star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason too.
Because I was grown up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues perceived me at the height of the eye," Keller recalls in conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
At first, she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "Traumschiff".
Now the journalists called only at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well."
She thinks it might have been possible that her husband at that time could have been very envious, but "as many men too shy Hans talks about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be the only right one for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed myself," as she explains.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman I was never in the truth, even though I sometimes appeared freaky and courageous on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a marriage already failed to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I feared that it could go wrong a second time."
On the day before the standing wedding, I was crying in the wardrobe and wanted to refuse everything.
The marriage of Borsody also failed.
Why never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller's love at that time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not daily.
I have approached love much too naive."
The night fold, which regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ-Resort Zurich, has waged to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our feather is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the grey shine in which a green carpet is dipped on the Six Floor Square, blinds it over charge.
But it's stopping film festival, there wants more or less famous in the light of light.
So on this late Thursday evening, he twists over the place to make it easier in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
The public toilet facilities sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is a great effort to stream a luxurious ambience in the parterre of a new pavilion.
This evening, however, it stinks in the Lords-Oasis for some reasons to heaven.
So out here, over to the other side of the streets: Loaded guests who have enjoyed the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" at the best level celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey warehouse each year.
That name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown come from all of the earth.
What do you not have to do with an article about this festival to avoid falling into sleek advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The feather binds a tape around the feelings that put a good feather to him, and two bully doorsteps actually win him generously in.
Inside, the invited ones are dancing far after midnight to live music or can be suggested by DJ rhythms to which they call each other, and rinse with Cüpli exquisite chops down.
In the delicate dining shop in the souterrain, oysters are waiting for lubricating mouths, alongside the incomparable raw shining Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain sprays.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been so for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The falter studys the sign at the roller staircase: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the roller staircase."
If the two are separate instructions, he has acted in the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved life.
In the budgetary department in the upper floor, the poultry picks up a cocktail prepared with Espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not imposed on this mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been working for those brands for years, isn't here in the evening either.
However, between local prominence, cassing table and kitchen items, there is a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
That's why his main exhibitor should not be far.
And really: At the same time Viggo Mortensen walks, with nearly sixty-sixties acting as a chorknabe, through the amount.
He's not occupied, not acquainted, one shakes the highest.
Especially for this restraint, like misunderstanding as obscurity, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 win of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old trainer danceed with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as can be seen in a video published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow-coloured tricot, fired by the players.
On Saturday, the Mexican second-tligist had defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican Club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Bondsliga 1: ASV Send to Last-Minute Pipe "Destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, Coach of the Handball Association Lieutenant ASV, could hardly record it: "So a bitter defeat." His shooters were "devastated on the ground" after the unhappy 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They hadn't played badly - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - over far phases, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we've been completely sleeping", the ASV trainer was angry.
The masters of the house at 8:1 quickly led the early expiry that Bieletzki had taken, not at first fruited.
"But then suddenly a backdrop went through the team," Bieletzki summoned the second quarter hour together.
For the break, the back was only two gates.
Especially Sending Best, Marius Hintze, encountered a different time in the phase.
After the change it was even better because of visitor's view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst resembled at 15:15, then the seasonal changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the Sirene, the proclamation was still apparently calming three results (29:26).
And then?
Put the impartial into the event.
Bieletzki usually guards from looking for debt with others.
But: The 120-second period penalty, which Steffen Mühlhoff sent, was a joke.
LIT laughed well and met four more times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought greatly, they also stood well against seven men and thrown them on the empty gate again and again.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a fucking victory has to come," said the restless Bieletzki.
ASV tour: hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), of the Pol (2).
Preparation (1).
Bavaria: Missed woman for 30 years - Police carries for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof) the police are looking for the mortal remains of the woman.
At Marxgreen on Saturday, forced forces poured up a road.
This was carried out by the streets and several layers below, as police and public prosecutors were jointly informed.
According to new insights, the missing ones may not have been buried far away from their place of residence at that time.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
At that time, the investigators did not exclude a crime.
Since last year, the Court of Criminal Police has been working together with the Prosecutors the information according to the case again intensively.
Along with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators found a strike under the street near Marxgrün through a soil radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials bordered the place to a few meters.
The results of the burials should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users indicates the dangers in the network.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
Additionally, security updates, such as Windows, should be installed quickly, nor is it harmful to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening revocation as head of the milliard heavy company.
He and the US Exchange Supervisor SEC contributed an extrajudicial dispute on misleading Twitter messages, where Musk could have lost the permission to run stock noted companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay 20 million dollars each, and Musk also spends the office of the Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German Supervisory Board.
On the other hand, Chief of the Board may remain.
In the comparison, which must not be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misbehaving.
The SEC had accused the world-famous manager of Manhattan's federal court for fraud.
Musk, who is also in charge of the Space Company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writer electric car pioneers, which is now evaluated at the stock exchange with more than $50 billion.
Musk is not aware of any fault
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter adherents, he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share that the financing is secured.
Tesla would have been assessed at a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later, Musk moved back: Tesla stays on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a Chairman from outside, set up two independent board members and set up a committee that supervises Musks communication.

Eden Hazard took care of the Chelsea leadership in the 25th minute with his sixth seasonal hit.
Afterwards, the clopmanship repeatedly missed the compensation.
National player Antonio Rüdiger clarified after a solo of Liverpool's Torjager Mohamed Salah on the line (31.).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge redeemed the reds with a slenter into the angle.
Record champion Manchester United has been sliding more and more deeply into the crisis after the worst season start since 1989.
The team of controversial trainers José Mourinho lost at West Ham United with 1:3 (0:2) and stays with ten points after seven play days only in the table center field.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League hit on Tuesday against the FC Valencia.
The former Leverkusen-Torhüter Bernd Leno came to his first prime-league approach after a violation of Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won by Tore of Raheem Sterling (29.) and Sergio Agüero (65.) 2:0 against Brighton&Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1:0, Ilkay Gündogan did not use the new top ride.

Survey: 46 percent don't want Merkel until 2021 as Chancellor
After the crossings of the past weeks, the GroKo collects several survey targets.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has brought over the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD adds a counter to 17 percent, which SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If on Sunday Bundestagswahl, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes together, according to Emnid.
Thus, the large coalition has now lost the majority of the Sunday question at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties are constantly up to 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allenbach: 51 percent).
At the 2017 Bundestags election, they received 53.4 percent together.
The bandwidth is also large among the other parties: the AfD, in several surveys, is the second largest party, to 15 to 18 percent.
The greens reach votes from 12.5 to 17 percent.
Left is an average of 10 percent, FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent to the top and downward, depending on the proportion of votes.
But also the restraint for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestags election.
At present only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the office of Chancellor, as the Emnid survey revealed on behalf of the BamS.
According to the survey, only every second (50 percent) wishes that the large coalition holds up to the next regular federal day election in three years, 41 percent are for a new choice.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, there were significant losses of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should again be a candidate for the CDU presidency in December.
47 percent, according to Emnid, are 44 percent.
In the Union's adherents, 64 percent therefore wish a candidate, 35 percent do not.
Exhibition at Aldi: Prices reduced to love
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of tiger there are no more romantic knowledge-making stories - that should be talking about poultry meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of the digital "Fastfood Datings" by Tiger and Co., the supermarket as a know-how location for the great love almost is an anachronistic romantic.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced coat meat, boxer short snippets on the Willet table or the favorite pending is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tiger is calling to be less a contact, but rather a tight stock.
We have dared the test: how do women react to talk about the hot breeze in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood-Lovestory-Potenzial then has it when the gap of love precedes an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-recovered plane.
If the guy is still reporting on his advertisements under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, this sounds very much to Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this Annonce in an unknown Aldi-Filialise that she will also find her dreamer, with whom she has shortly talked about the "30 percent reduced bio-poot meat".
For the belief in the magic of analogue learning, she deserves at least her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Bilderbeck: 500 covers for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri school has participated in the action "Deckel gegen Polio - 500 Deckels für ein Leben ohne Kinderlähmung".
Polio is the abbreviation of polyomyelitis, a disease caused by polyovir.
The disease referred to as child paralysis in German leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered extinct, but there are still three countries worldwide in which the disease occurs.
The cause of polyomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be impeded by vaccinations, as it is said in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand tranquility for gods
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB-Sport Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus called for an end to the public discussion on form and fitness of Mario Götze.

That's not good to the boy.

Football: District Liga: Researchers The VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this young season, then Alois Fetsch went into the court with His hardness.
He gave himself, the coach of VfL Wolbeck's soccer districtist VfL, to return (interior) to make sense of the lack of performance willingness on the green.
All history.
Meanwhile it's on the Brandhoveweg again.
The 1st day of the Sunday, the Taufrischer Beleg is against the SC Altenrheine, just scraped by the ascension during the past season.
Yeah, I'm very satisfied with the appearance.
"We have made the rooms tight and pressured on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and sought each individual for the game to simply say "Danke" for so much anti-protection against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system conversion after 26 minutes.
After the violation of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamless into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes was waiting in front of balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more play shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs in front of his outskirts (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th), missed the leadership.
Almost it would have been prevailed when the SCA in Minute 41 was the same two times in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer in the cloudbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his professional.
After the break, the VfL frequently took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes re-establishment.
With the variation of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left left missed another fresh cell curve.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was 18 meters in front of the guest case an indirect free movement for the placeholders.
The folded one attacked himself and demonstrated his risk at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right sleeve hit at the bottom left from the view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes left that should be damn long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the criminal room unhappy to hand.
Arbitration judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not escape the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase before Geske had the winner on the pocket in the 87th minute of 12 meters.
Could have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that was not enough for trainer Adi Hütter.
At Hanover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to take care of the first home victory.
Stürmer Ante Rebic, who was first in the start elevator after an injury, should help.

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in business boards
Only 8 percent of the boards were female on September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday and the German Press Agency presented.
"The companies will have to be different, otherwise the international competitors pass over them," said Stiftungs-Arbeitsführer Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male leaderships - with a few exceptions - have been no longer imaginable.
The residue makes German competitors less versatile, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's another business culture.
The small increase in women's share of the German stock exchange companies was also due only to positive impulses in the enterprises of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
However, according to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - over the past years, the women's share has been stagned.
Last, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again in the next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increase the share of "null percent".
Another picture comes from the Supervisory Boards: On September 1, the proportion of women was 30,5 percent - 45 women and 68 males less than a year ago.
"As many women were recruited for the boards each year, a share of 40 percent would be reached in 2023," says the report.
Some even make Miese: Luxury cars: Which manufacturer deserves most per car?
It's best for Ferrari.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each selling Ferrari and make 69,000 euros operating.
Large cars, great profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers pay per car that they sell?
This question has been addressed by "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros in the first half of the year with every sold car - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley are putting strongly on it even with each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros before interest and taxes EBIT.

A 27-year-old passant has been fatally injured in the collision of the operating vehicle with a taxi.
If emergency doctors are called, they're supposed to help - save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in Bonn at the collision of a emergency doctor's car with a taxi.
The taxi driver, the notary and their drivers were seriously injured, as the police told.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had crossed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then met on a crossing with the taxi that traveled with green.
After the collision, the physician car slipped against an ampelmast and a tree.
He recorded the passant who died at the site of the accident.
Driver of the emergency doctor and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency doctor were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from forces.
The severely injured 29-year-old notary could free himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called note doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were brought to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonner Prosecutorship, determines who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we uncomfortable
After the blamable exit in the Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU 1:3 is subject. The way the defeat is still to speak.
The scene in the 74th minute, in which the regenesed Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back to play.
Since they suspected an offside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all the defense players of Manchester stood, and Arnautovic read all the time in the world to pass the ball by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative highlight of a previous long distance of inadequate performance.
It is very different at United's City Rivale Manchester City.
The Citizens trained by Mourinhos large competitors against Brighton & Hove Albion came to a 2.0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through for the home team for the first time the defenses of the Aussenseniter.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former gate protector, provided the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for jumping to the table tip.
Liverpool no longer Table Leader
Three days after the 1:2 deposit in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Like the Cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoner.
The 27-year-old hit in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only match of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his slenzer.
So after the reds were started with a flawless balance in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the Remis in the Liga, the Blues Liverpool also crashed from the table tip.
Like City, the two London clubs of Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (in contrast to Watford) celebrated 2:0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, with Granit Xhaka, had to wait against the surprise team from the Hertfordshire county until the 81th minute for a success message.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford Defender Craig Cathcart buried an unhappy entry of Alex Iwobi into his own gate, just two minutes later, Mesut Özil, with his third seasonal hit, made the decision.
Thanks to the fifth victory, Arsenal passed by Watford and is newly behind the great Rival Todtenham on Rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave uprising Wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
The Wolves stayed at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in succession and lay the 8th place.
VW brand missing: Paris automotive salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris car salon takes place every two years in the change with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic, but all present: The Dieselcandal and the ringing of driving bans and retrospectives should not leave the German car corporations at the Paris industry meeting.
During the 2018 automobile salon, they show their novelties from the next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel actually doesn't play a major role in that.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the Government in Berlin, should be an important issue at least behind the glossy scenes of the trade fair stands.
A great name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and include their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the ingol cities is supposed to be marketed at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
However, both of them were officially presented.
The iNext of BMW should start until 2021.
The new 3er is at the heart of Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years in the change with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors arrived.
During the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Thousands are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injuries.
The island was shocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, there are enormous damages.
After the quake, the Tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims is still significantly high.
The figures are only from Palu until now.
However, many other communities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
Some 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle passor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final godship service for motorcycle drivers in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdohl - The place before the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcycle drivers on Sunday.
After all, the final goddess service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor passor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the mental concerns of the PS-star two-cycle drivers.
Between April and September always on last Sunday of one month, the traditional motorbike service (MoGo) takes place at the house of Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, on Sunday, about 150 bikers had gathered in order to do anything other than ordinary worship.
At 10 a.m., the Boliden were rearranged before the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker-freshoot was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a thick curry worst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were included.
The preaching held during the biker service of priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The Singer songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical undermaling.
"Although the bikers prefer the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill rather attacks poetic-calm sounds," says Pfarr Frank Schröder.
This was certainly a Novum in the history of the motorcycle goddess service yesterday.
Furder home club celebrates great festival: After the apple the milk comes
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pants.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also raised great interest.
He had his apple press in the luggage and demonstrated his astonishing spectators step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-nemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big thirst.
With a little muscle force, the apples became a fine cutting mass.
Not much of the children were still able to imagine how this should once become a tasteful drink.
But they could also look at this important step of work on this late Friday afternoon.
In shapes packed and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-nemerg stacked the a little like hackselware looking apple pieces layer for layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice went on and on into a large vessel.
But the foether farmer had already completed specialities.
So he opened his "shatted box" and presented the newest feather white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchorf" was accordingly large.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-in hupfburg for themselves.
Also active of the feuchtor comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the framework of the festival and invited some stations to short-term games.
Also in the next year, the home association will offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, will not be the home house in the heart of the Spargeldorf the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: Finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with the fourth seasonal plea: "Bishishishing situation"
Frankfurt/Main Following the fourth federalliga defeat, Trainer André Breitenreiiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around themselves and spoke courage to them.
However, there were many positives before at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shit situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-Football profi Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after, "That's, of course, disappointing, because you always take a lot."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86) joined, stands down with two counters and are a descending candidate in their current constitution.
On the other hand, Frankfurt, led by the superb Ante Rebic, celebrated the first season heim victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) achieved the gates for the DFB pocal winner, who, after the successful general test for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome, took seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's Vize world champion Rebic was involved in almost any dangerous offensive action of the Hessen and never to be handled by Hannover's defense.
The storms that have been hit after the WM showed with his pace and perseverance, why it is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, Brasilian Allan, who was borrowed by the FC Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurter, which began swinging.
Lucas Torró's headball, which was defeated on the gate network (17th), was in danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped at the last moment by the 96 defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (backs).
The leadership for the householders was almost compulsory and deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a defensive corner in the penitentiary room, Haller extended by head before the gate, where Ndicka only needed the foot.
It was the first Bundesligatre for the AJ Auxerre defense player in the summer.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time, Haller fitted his storm partner Rebic, who was able to drown through and did not leave a chance of 96-Torwart Michael Esser.
In the mid-term, Hanover-Coach responded to the weak idea of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxony played a little more courageous forward, flamming ideas remained until the end of the year, when the tracking hit still succeeded.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a little hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who only had to move the ball into the empty gate.
The rest of it was only for the Frankfurter against exaggerated guests, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes the partymeile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, good mood existed at the October festival in the city center.
The Oberbürgermeister Dieter Reiter in Munich created it in the opening of the 185th anniversary.
Munich's Wies'n last week with two strokes.
Geisings: Geisinger Christian celebrates Holy-Kreuz-Fest
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cruise Festival on 14 September or on Sunday afterwards.
The festival service takes place in the city church, then is a procession to the Holy Church with the final elevator.
The Holy Church houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year war, on whom the legend should have shot after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flows out of the shoe wound.
From this, a great pilgrimage developed to the shot Christ, which also led to the construction of the Holy Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar room stands, the lack of long house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, priest Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort, and life.
Despite the significance of the Geising parish, worship was badly attended.
After the service, the procession took place to the Church of the Holy Church and ended with the concluding side of the Church of the Crusade.
For many years, the Catholic church chor has then invited to the Catholic parish to the worldly part of the festival.
The choir members supplied visitors with hearty foods as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish community still offered tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to façade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will still move to the next year.
After the gear has already been set for some time, the damages could be more accurately identified and the individual tenders were more concretely prepared.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existed a few years ago has increased, but it has also been found more, which was only possible by the inauguration by means of gear.
The baseworks are completed, before the winter will be started with the natural stone work, and it is hoped that we will be able to complete the half of these work this year.
Inauguration: New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Danube-Iller life aid opens a new home for disabled people in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" will be handed over to his destination - all those present at the date of inauguration agreed.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers already living in the home of the Danube Illegian life aid have been dependent on the special architecture of the new construction.
Larger entrances, hallways and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas has taken into account architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans started about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer's building was placed on the test stand for the residents with mobile cap: "The house had come into the years and no longer timely in the equipment," said Bader retrospecting.
In 2016, the excavators hit to cut off the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life aid Danube-Iller opens new home
About 4.6 million euros invested life aid in the new construction.
The free state taxed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to Architect Bader, the buildings have remained in the planned framework - timely and financially.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Life Assistance, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagate between a barrier-free and simultaneously fire-proof construction had not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without any other help.
The head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said similarly: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents who need tools to be mobile."
Kreutmayer said that the living and functionality had been well combined.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real lucky case, because it is no longer in today's situation."
Overall, the new home in the Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three residential groups at almost 1500 square metres.
Stolz is life aid guide Heinz to the eleven full-time workers who are all employed by tariff.
Germany: Sweety complains of differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unit, the deputy SPD board chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all countrymen not to find themselves with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain unit after almost 30 years.
We cannot satisfy these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on the "day level on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create the same conditions of life throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked in the meantime longer than the people in West Germany, but 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German unit," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this malicious dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan-Jagdhund is intended to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In pursuit of a relaxation of relations with Seoul, Pjöngjang gave the South Korean president Moon Jae In two North Korean pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two of them reached their receiver on Thursday about one year old dogs.
So they passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the animals' "comfort".
The dogs with the thick white fur, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural estate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship had announced to the north at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean captain Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pjöngjang.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and join in applying for the broadcasting of the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual approximation, Kim also agreed to close the test plant To Bunggg Ri for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history mirrored by 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months, numerous new books have appeared that mostly answer this question in view of the past hundred years.
In a different way, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive, set up Austria in the magnificent "Bilderbuch", which will appear on October 1st.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to Sacharbeit - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition that starts today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not recently conjured the "return to work" mantra-like.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cassians and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and work, but it's here.
If the Federal Government is now ready to re-establish its mission - to govern - then it should not be discouraged with denomination.
Whether Union and SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and bubbles in the last weeks, may already show Monday.
In the evening, the summits of the government parties come together to the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to raise conflicts early; a teaching from all the disputes.
First of all, however, conflicting issues are on the agenda with the Diesel renewal and the Professional Immigration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to leave the car companies with exchange premiums gently away, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to re-equippe older diesel technically.
During the weekend of this crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned professional immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for refused asylum seekers who work or make training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "spure change" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be again dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equally and equally with GroKo, but three partners with partly very different societies and priorities.
Arguing is good.
Without a dispute, a society that is so diverse, sometimes contradictory, does not go ahead.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be rebuilt for party tactical reasons on the question of being or nothing.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD are to fight, but always have the human life-effectiveness in mind.
What is feasible and helps many?
This key issue can clarify both the diesel and the trace change question pragmaticly - and thus recover confidence.
In particular, the People's Partys have to fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister for Fisheries
Does the Minister of Labour infringe the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Effectly day and night" her legislators would have worked on social security reform, reported an overwhelming social minister in presenting the same two weeks ago.
In the case of list Pilz Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprised - it now brings the matter into Parliament via request.
She assumes that "the minister was only trying to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and never to announce violations of applicable service law before running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to free Har tinger from any suspicion.
Police sweeps a street looking for women's corpse
Marxgree - The police did not want to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been buried.
The route is locked in the area of Marxgreen until Monday.
The investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old men, could finally confine the relevant place to a few meters along with his leader in several applications.
In addition, a soil anomalty was discovered together with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the said road.
For more than a year, the Court of Justice and the Criminal Police has been working the misfortune.
At Marxgreen a cycle path was closed again and examined with sonar devices because the authors suspect that in the course of the new construction of the state street, Heike's body could have been reinforced 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Crowds in Barcelona before Catalon-year-old
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is the first time.
But it's already happening to crowns before.
The Separatists have not forgotten police use from autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence Report on 1 October 2017, there have been conflicts between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence advocates, among other things, with color powders when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 police officers of Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who had been employed in the election locations last year.
At that time, when attempting to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also come.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of Separatists and the central state security forces separately, Spanish media reported.
Some of the about 6,000 separatists would then have tried to break through the police chain with violence, and the officials were thrown with color bags and eggs, among others.
Six persons had been arrested that 24 others had been easily injured, it was called upon the authorities.
On Monday, for the first time, the independence referendum is yearned.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to terminate the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The former regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also retired abroad.
On the other hand, several Ministers of the regional government and other activists of the Separatist Movement are still in U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the entry into force of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra is based on the "right on self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected Ratelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-white pale continues to take place.
Also at the FC Gütersloh there was only one 0:0 distinction.
The final light and the third last pupped them in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium as assembled irregularity.
The first half was overlookable from the entertainment factor.
For this reason, those who would prefer to pick up a beer or a bratwurst could do this without concern.
There was not the risk of missing a torchance because there was practically no one.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (unharmless) torch of the entire party, goodsslohs Nick Flock was responsible in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle also true - option had the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes with a shot from the criminal area border to a parade.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged injuries, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel, from 18 meters, barely over the housing, and after one hour, the goods lovers appeared for the first time openly.
After a ball conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
Sinan Aygün's "crowded" Nick Flock (62.) with a but-let shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.), they followed a cornerball of the ex-aller Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahlener did not achieve.
Only in the 91nd minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but also it didn't bring anything.
Angelo Daut strived to draw out the positive: "I liked that we played zero," but unfortunately, the zero also stood ahead.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as against wooden wickede and that even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim trainer.
Offensive, "smoothing everything so a bit" against a team, "who just wanted to defend.
I didn't have the feeling that we could get a countertor," said Daut.
To his suffering, however, one as a spectator did not feel as if his team could shoot a gate.
For that, the idea was too short.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
This is delighted by Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table edition for which these donations are intended.
The honourables assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
In opening, the sky was radiant blue, but the place was still a little empty, but it was still to change during the day.
For, "Here it's so nice, so we're here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the Fest Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent Prise Humor.
For the couple of Brockmann, which was to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creamers.
And the "substitute" could not take it to talk between musically the ever-increasing visitors.
This came so well that some folk songs were sung in later hours.
"Only great," Marcel Kreimer was pleased.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is delighted with the many active people with their stands, among them mainly associations.
"Especially there should not be something like a table at all," he thanked himself for the action of the men's chore.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all who were in use at the stables and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful touch - here's something.
Then the Maikrans was taken from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the firearm and brought to the winter quarter.
At many stages, it was worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heartfelt everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who lives in Reckenfeld for a year, was creative at his decopier saw.
Furnierarbeiten, beetle cover with rackfields motifs and a lot more he had in offer.
A specialty offered three rackfields of Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wederhoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has another specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so well the cake tasted.
The gathering is it that the visitors allowed to stay long to the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Smearing with local political message: No successful advertising for skating plants
In Lengerich, unknowns have hardly been designated for the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are similar lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne of the City Administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been punished for damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" were called on signs at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, Manager of the Halle, reports that after the professional election fair on 19 September, a corresponding letter was discovered on the advertisement sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message of his time was apparently "only" left with an ed, it could easily be removed.
"But a few days later it was back, this time sprayed up," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the appropriate advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note gets this case just by calling several large companies from Lengerich on the table.
If the skate plant is built, its realisation is to be possible through sponsors.
Assignments are already available, Jörg Hesselmann explains from the urban field of school, sport and culture, without name.
Well possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies standing on the shamed table.
For years local policy and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate plant.
After the old was cut off at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
The Council finally voted in majority for the fire-protection park.
However, this idea was not transposed - too many factors seemed to have spoken against a construction at this point.
At the end of June there was a turn.
Members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says to the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word is the city council.
He goes out of a decision this year, so that it could be built in a positive vote in 2019.
Engpass for air security becomes worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European aviation shot in summer, the German aviation engines do not see signs of an improvement in the next year.
"In this year we had wind, we will have strong winds in 2019 and then the storm will come," said the Chief of the Flight Assurance Trade union, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency in front of the Aviation Summit on October 5th in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-term notion of staff in the European airlines, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market was empty for fully trained lots.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized that various air traffic unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hansestadt, representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany, the countries, air security, airlines and airports meet on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work pockets and overtime, this will not go without us," said the Chief of the GdF, who has many members in the German air insurance company.
Maas again made the EU Commission responsible for the Lotsen-Misere.
The transport forecasts for the regulatory period running by 2019 have been much too low.
The resulting costs and personnel savings in the national air security sector are now fully covered by the operating business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) in Brussels for regulations that "do not continue to cut air" the air.
At present, EU standards would be harmonised by 2024 and further intensifications would be feared.
The EU was subject to constant lobby printing by the Airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now harvest exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
It hopes that the high delay costs would be reconciled by the airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German Aviation Assurance (DFS) offers a "unanimous training and future pact", said Maas.
The so far announced recording of 120 lottery students per year over the next five years is rich just to balance the old-related exits.

Barcelona: Violence in demos by policemen and Catalan independence advocates.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent conflicts with many injuries.
According to the city administration, some 3000 policemen from all over Spain were gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 advocates of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests away from each other with a great opposition.
However, according to the forces, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security lock.
You would have attacked the officials with color and gun shots.
According to the information, rankings were also made between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told you there were six arrests.
Better salaries and assessment of colleagues
The police had wanted to appreciate their demonstration to the colleagues who had done almost exactly a year ago against the Spanish Central Government's banned independence referendum in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil feel it unjust that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators emphasized it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Only to provoke and celebrate the fact that they have distorted us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands who wanted to give his name only with Daniel rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: defending the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there for implementing our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a large European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not come to provoke," the police assured.

Football: Juve trainer commends for top party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star storm played "in this evening the best game along with the half an hour of Valencia," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) - victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the expensively purchased star was also without its own gate of the decisive man in the important party against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and makes it good," said Allegri.
Even though we started tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to the three tower templates of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early retirement through the hit of Dries Mertens (10. minute) and depended on the worst persecutors in the first place.
The Torschäger, cherished by Real Madrid, first opened the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who provided the leadership with a double pack (26/49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner of the headball, also made the pre-joining to the hit of defense chef Leonardo Bonucci (76).
"He gives many templates," praised the trainer.
But of course, Allegri wants to see gates of the attacker who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese National Team of Record Tower Protectors.
"We need to become even better in serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve-Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than EUR 100 million, the overpower of Juventus seems to be even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the makelless series in series A. At 21 points, the master of the seven years behind has already had six counters jump on Naples.
The two tables trained by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti were not chanceless against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to get too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the place.
"We played well against a good Naple," commented the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel.
The German national player has worked with Juve.
The professional from the FC Liverpool was in use at all seven leagues.
The middle field actor also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, who said Allegri with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flying from the square at the 2:0 victory of the Turins and was locked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
With a particularly sharp appearance, Rapper Kanye West took care of the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume ensured fore-runs and questionnaires with the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change in the publication of his new album.
You can only call him "Ye", so the musician.
"The being known earlier as the Kanye West," he twittered to the dead singer Prince when he left his artist's name.
However, the pseudonym is not a news.
Already the tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRL, the artist explained that "Ye" has a religious significance for him.
"I believe "Yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "du", says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Made!
Hutmar's trainer Averhage made no hole from his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simpler, we put him in trouble as well as never. Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar's capabilities is thin.
Grade two torchances in 90 minutes, so you can only rarely make games positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sending horst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first pass, but the first Maik Krause used from a sharp angle to the early tour (7.).
In the 43th minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after a great pre-working of crows, he was standing free.
The hosts had only a double possibility when Moritz Höne first failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and also found his master at the Sendenhorster Keeper in the poster Jan Blome.
After the break, the guests became more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69,) all gave.
A tradefmeter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the gateline and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stochered the ball over the line, the party was decided (81.).
"We had criticized ourselves before, that was then different today than in the last few weeks," was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sending horst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Tores: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectakelball in Albania: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about it," he ran by words.
"We don't have access to them," he thought to have the wing singing with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites that seemed with collective offensive urgency.
Still, he could laugh, "A dirty victory," he said, twinkered frech and pulled from then his players, however, was the relief that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of them, namely, to play the championship and the other, Albersloh, fight to maintain the class.
Understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back to the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was our best season performance at a distance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2, how we hold across the time of the game against one of the top teams of the Liga, that was really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you now have to drive home with empty hands.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12th season tournament (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side musterful for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take it out completely.
"That was already mad what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent indecently.
Shortly before the change of the page, his own eleven managed to compensate: McGill's release from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe into the long torque (45.).
After the change of the page it was McGill, who achieved the compensation (59.).
Afterwards, it went and back.
It was a cracky, action-loaded game.
Nebel again shocked Albanians (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann resembled (69.).
Despite surplus, Albersloh no longer managed to compete the last Concordia counter (80.) again.
We now have to focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against sheep, that's what we have to win," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbucker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow red: Atalan (74/Albachten).

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent Guests and New Offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Thus, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: he was not at Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and afterwards, Wulf was a guest there.
In this way, academy director Udo Hahn remarked when he proudly said: "All German presidents and Chancellors were already with us."The fact that at the Academy at Tutzing Castle, he repeatedly appeared prominents, was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer Constantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on September 29, Frido Mann is writer at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President of State Emmanuel Macron has also promised: He wants to receive the "tolerance prize" given to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which also receives TV moderator Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The around 80 meetings by mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not sure!" is in a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And at a meeting on Syria: "Barbarei without limit".
Deals of weapons, destruction, torture, death - the war deprives every human idea."
From structural racism in society through the screams between arm and rich to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academy director Hahn convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions."
At a meeting on 200.
Birthday of Karl Marx in the near future, the more visitors are expecting the direction of capitalism criticism, the others rather a tendency "from left outside to center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Landeskirche," said professor Dr. Ulrike Haendenl, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret testimony, the gender understanding prevailed, not only with humor and heartwarming for the (sensitive) woman and the (sensitive) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar set it in and also mastered her violin.
Ben sat on the wing.
This is one of the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: so congenial harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have desired a solo.
It was also there, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, as it fitted to the red thread of the evening.
There, Teubner had played a paradoxon: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but he doesn't open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates self-employed: What would be the result of Mozart's composer, "the nannerl" would have opened the door hopelessly?
So Süverkrüp glids over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head full of blood and wounds" into the "Lied of Death", and from Mozart g-Moll symphony into a playful dance.
There were great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers handed Karlheinz Klein, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But the Chairman Heidemarie brandbeck could not take additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the Duo one in Wolbeck in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Ladies-Landesliga: Ahlener SG retains against TV Wattenscheid almost the white West
The Ahlene women had problems mainly with the third-liga player Carolin Stallmann, who only marked ten matches.
"Especially I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many gates.
We haven't managed them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry with the many outdated opportunities.
The concentration in the end missed his team this time.
Therefore, the ASG ran a backrest almost until the end, at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.) behind.
At the end, the broader bank of the hosts made it decisive to be noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put back space Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extrem clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschketter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), p. Fitzek.
Fullyball: 3. Liga Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the full-eyball women of the BSV Ostbevern have re-established in the top group of the 3. Liga West.
At the second-tliga VC allbau dinner, the blue-whites won with 3:1.
"That was a great step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked out this," Trainer Dominik Münch welcomed his team's almost inadequate performance at the crashed table leader.
The first passover dominated the guests almost by popularity.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice champion of the previous year with 25:15.
Food has been accepted in the two row, but hasn't come into the game.
We've done it well.
Our opponent has shot up with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Ess has converted the acceptance to three bars.
We couldn't keep the impact pressure.
Food has varied, and we have let ourselves go a little," Münch continues.
At 18:17, the full-eyball women from the Ruhr region had the nose for the first time.
Although East Bevern refused four sentence balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found his goal.
"The game was now a class better," the exercise manager was at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the use of the BSV in the third section of 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and quietly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the blue-white passage brought four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught a fine day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) criticized the way in which the great Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left a scorpion in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be converted effortfully," said the president of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network of Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance of a common, reconciling appearance.
"As side by side with German top politicians underlined the belonging of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The large outlet of the German public has "enhancing many reservations".
Home Club Nottuln: Offer has already established
After the long summer break, Folktreff time is finally again.
On October 18th (Donnerstag) at 19.30 p.m., the Nottuln home association has already organized its fifth noodtulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Old Officer.
Almost on the day it is then a year ago that we have done a folktreff for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become a solid part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln", Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Home Association.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk crew was bled so fast in Nottuln.
Whether in January or in the heat wave, the fireplace of the Officemanei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next Folktreff is like always a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folksongs, Evergreens and old beatings," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who regularly invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer promised with his accordion for the first Folktreff "Birthday".
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the district of Steinfurt, who played music with platt-German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreffs remember the last event in summer when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten, with its international version of the song "Frees in the night", enthusiasmed the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend a happy and humorous evening again," says the home association's invitation.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to play actively is invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always fast, it is recommended to be there time enough.
The Folktreff starts at 19.30 p.m. but the entry is already at 7:00 p.m.

From pure fruit to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the district association for gardening and country care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbach Vereinshaus, the last impetus for the district association for gardening and rural care Kulmbach was set, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a large anniversary in the town hall of Kulmbach on Saturday evening.
In 1893, he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa, who was the "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land".
The purpose of the fruit-building association also differed from today’s work - it was really pure about fruit-building, flowers and gardening at that time no one thought.
"At that time, in the epoch of the information, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimpfleger Günter Dippold in his festival presentation.
Fruit trees should be swammed away roads, so-called industrial gardens were built at schools.
The fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 gardening associations in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7000 members.
But this does not make the spectrum exhausted at all.
Natural gardening, biological plant protection, village enchanting and nutrition plays a key role as well as the mediating of knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The multitude of the tasks of a garden building club showed members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwurfe" entertaining at stage.
"Youth work is urgently necessary, especially in the digital age," said the Circular Chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of life experiences in nature.
The chestnut collection was a great deal for us children, I doubt that with smartphone & co. you can gain a similar amount of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with the Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner to the anniversary.
"Where they are to stand, the Kreisverband decides," complemented Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of garden building associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many garden building associations in the district also made no doubt about the circular leader and expert consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a picture presentation through the long history of the circuit association and reported, among other things, the need for self-supply after the war.
Previously, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was invaded.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the farm garden changed to a decoration and living garden.
"The nature has survived, it was already in front of us and we have to orient ourselves to her," the expert pleaded for fruit and nuts trees.
That is why there is the encouragement for the garden building associations not to leave in order to keep our home beautiful and worth living.
In addition, the President of the Bavarian Federal Association, Wolfram Vaitl, complemented the new citizens in our associations.
"We have to stop the eclatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif closed the successful festival that was celebrated by the towers of the music club Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister delegates UN-Rede
Mexico's government wants clarity in matters of Nafta: they represent both trade partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and pushes her speech in front of the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure to ring for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland moved her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations Assembly, her speaker Adam Austen informed.
In the meantime, they concentrate on the renewal of Nafta.
On Friday, the Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo had explained that the negotiating leaders of Canada and the USA would have 48 hours to agree if Canada would actually want to join the trade agreement between its country and the USA.
In August the USA and Mexico agreed on a recast of the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The conversations about a new edition have been running for over a year.
Until Sunday evening (local time) they are now supposed to be completed, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure in the negotiations, Mexico's designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday to seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured by a trade fair attack, left the hospital.
The ex-military of the right wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro after a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo" where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will take public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked at the beginning of September during a election campaign in southern Brazil on open streets.
In the meantime, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people went to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not") women's associations called for protests against the ex-military.
In social networks, the associations against Bolsonaros also made racist and despised statements mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In Brasilian capital, the protests were mixed with a demonstration of the presidential candidates of the Brazilian Worker Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for corruption and is therefore not allowed to be convicted.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
Haddad was the former mayor of the million city of São Paulo in surveys far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has long been mixing in politics, it is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there is a string election on October 28th.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not be successful from this - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known to hate homosexuals and blacks and glorify the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He shakes again and again with verbal eliminations.
Another time he said that the trailers of Lulas should be shot.

After long disease: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
On the bed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year.
Larsen became known with the Gasolin band, which was enormously successful in the 1970s in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the resolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is the most sold album in Denmark until now.
On Sunday, the Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen honored Larsen in a statement as "Straßenjungen", which was "contrary to everything but in all the hearts".
The head of the government also reminded that the monarchy opponent Larsen had occurred in 2010 at the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock Night in the shoe factory: Volume on press air hammer level
"Here We stand here, take the bone saws and fire a concert evening with the power of a tiger."Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" include such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the citizens' center of Shoefabrik: Hardrock pur of three other friendly bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the beginning of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photograph.
There's no trace from lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and surroundings - all in the association with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly make the about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night clear.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows to convince the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces of their own spring and the CD that appears soon.
In front of the stage, the band is danced for a voting and impressive interplay.
Although "tolerance" calls are not to be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the trio "Here We Stand" the stage.
The fact that hardrock is not equal to hardrock, demonstrates guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternatives, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesizer is also used.
Not only is the desirable, almost balladen "Take Me Home" bestowed by the change of melodic passages to the guitar-lasting rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" of tonnish mammals, however, has played a special degree of knowledge since its founding in 2005.
Full agility the band presents her hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - has special stage experience, is obvious and unobscribable.
Sänger and guitarist Tim Jungmann also puts on the one covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, very own accents.
At the same time, Gitarrist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a rejoiced solo, running through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume belongs to such a hardrock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, the mixer team's three-time concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at press air hammer level, but it is still clearly below the exclusions of the "Waken-Fesitval", which refers to the "The ignition" on their website.
Earnning 120 decibels in nozzle sound strength as usual for the annual metal steal dough in the north of the Republic, the Ahlen audience does not need at this rock night.
After nearly four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuosic game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and burned a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say at the end, freely in the transmitted sense.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man at a sailing aircraft accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At the airport of Mülheim/Essen, a fatal accident has occurred.
On a parking lot at the airport of Mülheim/Essen, a sailing aircraft is crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the disaster.
Near the airport of Mülheim/Essen, a deadly accident has occurred on Sunday.
According to the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, a sailing aircraft was crashed at the trade fair park at the airport.
The pilot had died.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student had been on board alone - the flyer is supposed to be an entrepreneur.
At the time of accident, the plane was already in the landing flight.
The crash site is only close to a fixed tent on the airport site.
But a October festival has taken place since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly on the rise to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park & ride offer at large events at the trade fair Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump calls Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the US President of North Korea's powerier Kim is very well-beinged despite nuclear crisis is not a mystery.
But now Trump has made his colleague a genuine declaration of love.
She also has to do with Kim's "Wonderful Letters".
At a decent age of 72, the married US president has known himself as a new flame.
The tragedy: It's a remote relationship.
In all public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean captain Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of followers in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half so old spoil of the Ruler Dynasty from Pjöngjang, although it proves to be quite tough breaches in the rings around North Korea's atomic disarmament.
"I was knalling, he too, and between us it went and then," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote beautiful letters to me, they were great letters.
Their personal connections also brought political fruits: Trump pointed to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics behind it have seen little more than lip credences.
The fact that the affection for the "Rocket Man", as Trump's nickname for Kim, whether his martial threatening, would not be any memoryer, seemed to be well aware of the US president.
At any rate, he took the expected criticism of it when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they were in love."
How horrible, how horrible is that?
That's so unpresidial.
But he cares very little, explained Trump and then directed his point-finger to the crowd: "I always told you, it's so simple to be presidial."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people pushing into this greatly filled arena, but we'd only stand out 200 people.
October festival attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visits, calmly and above-become plundered by sunshine: Very varied and with a good shot October festive flair, Baesweiler's city center was poured out on Sunday.

Refugees saved through video from libysche prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya by using a mobile video and thus allowing their salvation.
The group had turned in her cell in the coastal city of Sawya under risk of life in July and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alarmed the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flew out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"We couldn't have returned to Nigeria without the video," said Efe Onyeka, who had taken the video, the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya when trying to reach the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he said he was in danger of life.
One of his competitors had been pleaded almost to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the imprisonment conditions were catastrophic: "They struck us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees who are strangled in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria had been sent back to their home this year by means of the program, said the IOM speaker in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now saved Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the bad imprisonment conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a phone video call.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhuman.
The North African state, which is dominated too largely by militia, is the main transit country for migrants on the road from Africa to Europe.

Laschet admonishes the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in the discussion with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to its own information, gave an admonition to the rule of law in Turkey.
The relationships between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Cologne Airport.
This concerns mainly arrest waves, press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise themselves in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for it.
Laschet, according to his own information, also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of opinion should be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The discussion of Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the aviation willingness of the Federal Defense Ministry at the Cologne Airport.
Originally, it should have been done at the Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected it from political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to open thisib Moschee in Cologne.
Laschet had arranged a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Missing confidence in the US: North Korea demands disarmament
While U.S. President Trump is not tired of emphasizing success in the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the ostasiatic regime represents the conditions more nutritious.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a meeting of Washington.
North-Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has proposed the US government at the UN General Debate to block negotiations for a nuclear weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest abstinence is therefore that the US builds on forced measures that are fatal to trust education," said Ri in New York.
A disarmament is indispensable to North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we are first to open up ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that penalties in North Korea could "force the knees" is "a dream of people who don't know us".
To build confidence, however, his country stopped his nuclear and missile tests and destroyed an atomic test system, Ri highlighted.
From the US side, however, there have been no "comprehensive reactions", the minister criticized.
Due to North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone decided three times sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have in recent days urged the United Nations to strictly respect the criminal measures.
At the same time, the US government is working on a approach.
In June, Trump had first met North Korea's captain Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is to travel to Pjöngjang again to talk about the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapon program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth staircase, the many visitors of the HoT house got nothing with: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet waiting for the guests after the harvest thankful God service.
The youngsters of the HoT had the buffet with delights from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the municipality for which the young people wanted to thank themselves for the food.
The start with the new facility was not just easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the director of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were best prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break the evil surprise came: a power failure had put the huge two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was corrupted and had to be disposed.
"Now we had to start again from the front: although we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to create it alone," says Westbuer.
And that's how everyone packed up.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Best it can't cook either," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido was served for a short time or the guests were allowed to serve at quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their legs," said parisher Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen made a lot of surprises with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board NRW the table
From frustration of criticism from its own rows, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, delivered his posts in the national association.
Sartor had become known throughout the country because the Essen table had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice-Chairman of the NRW Tafels, said Sartor the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen too many in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, Chief of the Tablen-Lande Association of NRW, expressed understanding of the decision of his long-standing alternate.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
"I can understand his step - there people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table did."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, there is nothing going on", said Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized in the "World on Sunday" again criticism of colleagues of other tablets.
You may not follow the approach, "without starving the people in the city."
It is the task of the State to ensure that people did not die.
The Essener did not participate in a convention of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"It tells me too much sweet shit," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that criticized me that way.
SF Lorch Play 2:0 Guide - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Lorch Districtliga Lost against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after rear - Bettringen strikes Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0, Lorch was already in the home game against the TV Newler - at the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Very different from the TV hypocrites: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly reached the rear meeting with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the table point, the SGB was able to reach a 3:0
Gladbach plays two times leadership - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz to the first season victory (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke has been maneuvered in the first five league games with early towers.
Now, Domenico Tedesco's team again put that strength on the day with which it had invested the first place behind the Bavaria during the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf brought the Heimequipe in the eleventh minute after strong pre-working of Jewgeni Konopljanka by head, and the hosts then preserved the mini-polster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund welcomes newly from the top of the Federal League.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated a 0:2 relapse against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half, it was still a 4-2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) were similar to a doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was switched into Favre in the 63th minute, provided with another doublette in the final phase (86./94.) for the crowning finish of the performance increase after the break.
The first victory was also the VfB Stuttgart.
Against the yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic, Werder Bremen had to fear the Stuttgarter in the meantime before the break.
Borna Sosa and the inconsistent Goalie Ron-Robert targets produced a curiose owner who helped guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a happy, but also a misleading debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher who joined the Swiss Quartet Yann Summer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a two-time tour, played 2:2 and still waited for an outward victory in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible with his second Federal Lieutenant.
Yann Summer was powerless at the 20 meters of the Aargauer flat, as was the second counterpart after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa appears in the storm of the foals as a goalgetter.
At Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from the OGC Nice came for the third time in succession and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach has the 4th place.

Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back to the game by a curiose owner (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarter's overwhelmingly acting back to the victory street.
Nuremberg decided the Duell against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereign for himself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already took the home team on course through Foulpenalty.
Macedonian votes on new national names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens today agree whether the name of their country is to be changed in northern Macedonia.
With a yes, the almost three decades of conflict with the neighbours of Greece could be solved.
Athens had been on a name change because of his northern province and blocked any approach to Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become Nato member at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrer in U-Haft.

SPD politician: John Kahrs marries his friend

They gave themselves the Jaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" timetable.
"If we marry, then right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman of the SPD-Bundestag fraction and one of the speakers of the Seeheim circle, the conservative SPD flight.
In the Bundestags debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had excited with an anger on June 30, 2017.
Thus, he had accused Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "stolpert" on the topic.
"That was your Schabowski-moment," he said in presentation on the accidental announcement of the Günter Schabowski DDR frontier opening.
Since 1 October 2017, the same sex couples can marry just as iterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, e.g. with the right to adopt.
Garden Day: 400 meters crochet cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Civil Association Children's House and the Society of Lessons.
For around 400 meters of gates around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Prunner House should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it was working for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce the costs," said the president of the Civil Association Walter Schröer.

"It's all to stay with forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner collects gold at the Kanuslalom-WM
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
On Sunday, the 29-year-old put a perfect course on the Olympia line.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympia-Bronze at three hundred-seconds.
I was well prepared, had already had enough rides here on the plant, and it has fitted everything today," said the 2012 Olympic Trip of London.
In the goal, he threw his paddle away from joy and recruited both arms victoriously to the height - well-knowledging that it would be at least for a medal.
After all, he had starting number four.
But the six still remaining launchers couldn't end up his fabel time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting indicates the first attempt to break this autumn into a family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days will be shorter - that's what breakers want to make use of them again.
So the police inspector Gauting mentioned yesterday the first attempt to break this autumn.
It is due to the alarm system when trying to stay at the one-family house on the Königswieser Straße.
It happened when the perpetrators put hand on Friday just before 20 o'clock on Friday.
The infringers knew that the inhabitants were not at home.
The alarm system, however, seemed to surprise her that she took the escape without a probe.

Pleite at Hertha: Collected by reality: Bayern demanded against Ajax
The predication is indispensable: the defeat in Berlin wants to be "not pleased" by the FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim case for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small doll under the new coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase to the larger domestic depth for the Munich.
"One week ago, one had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we got a little reality," Thomas Müller observed after the deserved 0:2 deposit at Hertha BSC and demanded a response for the Champions League-Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, he knows that this is really angry with us and that's why we're going to give us gas on Tuesday.
For the first time, for more than a year, no own gate shot out, as at the same time of the presaison two compulsory games in series without victory, the table management in the football bandesliga first lost on Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must have been warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intensive man-to-man-tactics and the Berliner through their playful needle sticks delivered the same two blue breaks within three days, as the last superpowered Bavaria must be knacked.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we'll do everything so that we'll be successful again," stressed Kovac.
However, otherwise, he and his losers in his birthtown were surprisingly gentle and moved his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first interim of his term positive before the country game break - otherwise the sound should be intensified.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second king class appearance of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which had also forced AEK Athens sovereign with 3:0.
"Now it's caught us in two games, but we'll also make our gates again," announced National Team Captain Manuel New.
As after the lost pokalfinale against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clear text.
The legal defendant appeared in the role as a Mahner.
"I don't think that this is all pech, we have to do it again, because we don't make the number of chances and make the mistakes behind," said the 23-year-old shortly before departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavaria were already with five meters behind Dortmund, which has now taken over the top again with a point of advance.
And so Kimmich, with an eyedrinker, at least appreciated positively that now the public debate on the supposedly invaluable Bavaria has ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Schusslinie: Özil-Causa: Sharp Attack by Erdogan to Grindel
With severe accusations, Turkish president Erdogan pleads an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on various stages for the deuting authority in the permanent streak theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president criticized the dealing with the ex-world championship in Germany for the opening of the major Ditib Moschee in Cologne, the DFB CEO defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, the Grindel attacked by Özil personally sharply in the Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio" announced consequences from the Causa.
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds - that is not repeating this," said the 57-year-old and wanted to win a national player with no migration background as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel re-explained that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
With sharp words, it had prejudged racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our mesut Özil and our Ilkay born in Germany.
They excluded them from this society because they were allowed to photograph with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the Domstadt.
In fact, as her president, I couldn't dignify that our two young men, who had climbed up to the German national team, were excreted.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil after the WM issue, which had taken its start by photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced to want to face players in the future.
That someone says, if I win, I'm German, when I lose, I'm migrant - that's not gonna be.
"That he has such an impression, I'm very sorry," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
He does not see a basis for a return to Özils to the national team either.
In addition to the born Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer will now be called.
"If a person without migration is clearly involved in society and football, saying, "The topic is important, we have to take care of," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the spot where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-off and the Özil-Affair, he wants to be a DFB president again in the next year.
"I do my work and try to do it as well as I do," said Grindel.
Yearlier builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police reported, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 o'clock.
First, the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady at the red lighter in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
This told the pensioner that he would have driven against her car.
However, there was no personnel exchange because the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a car driver who would come off the road and drive against a headquarters.
On that point, the man didn't want a police on site and then went away from it.
Afterwards, the Rödentaler went home.
However, the pensioner in his residence, where he has lived for decades, has processed and has framed a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a stronger impression and couldn't feel much more.
The damage is about EUR 1300.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still almost 1000 forces in use.
About four weeks after the eruption of the Moorbrand on a Federal Army site in Emsland, 980 forces are still employed with the deletion work.
That told the Federal Army on Sunday.
As the situation of a spokesman continues to develop stablely, the last 70 honourable helpers have been deducted.
A further reduction in the number of forces was planned.
In the night of Sunday, an aboveground fire was discovered and deleted.
Last week, the disaster case was lifted, which was called well a week earlier on September 21, because it was feared that the flames were threatened by wind and radio flight to adjacent forests and settlements.
Thursday it was then said that a crossing of the fire to neighbouring communities no longer was threatening.
At times, more than 1500 forces tried to control the large fire on site.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehrtestgelände at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also information flights with drones of the Federal Army.
According to the Federal Army, "Tornados" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was triggered by test missiles that had fired Airbus technicians.
The smoking fire of the Moorbrand had been moved to Bremen up to a hundred kilometres from the northwest of Germany.
On Monday, the Federal Army wants to set up a contact point that receives damage notices.
First claims for damage had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday owners.
SPD politician: John Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the politician married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician John Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
They gave themselves the Jaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" timetable.
When we get married, right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman of the SPD-Bundestag fraction and one of the speakers of the Seeheim circle, the conservative SPD flight.
In the Bundestags debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had excited with an anger on June 30, 2017.
Thus, he had accused Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "stolpert" on the topic.
"That was your Schabowski-moment," he said in presentation on the accidental announcement of the Günter Schabowski DDR frontier opening.
Since 1 October 2017, the same sex couples can marry just as iterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, e.g. with the right to adopt.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia the voluntary referendum has begun with a new name for this small Balkan state.
Around 1.8 million voters are supposed to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.

For almost three decades, Athens has blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and the Nato.
If the citizens vote with yes, they also give the start of their country's West Integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register aims to facilitate donations of organs and to reduce members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that institutions can only be removed with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland launches an electronic register for organ donors on this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donations and reduce members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in death can be registered there.
Your wishes are then available in the case of Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change that institutions, as in Germany, are allowed to continue to be taken only with explicit consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss people have a donor certificate, says Franz Immer, Director of the SwissTransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card is found at the crucial moment of possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"They must then decide deputy in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the hospital card, as the spokesman of the Federal Center for Health Information says, Marita Völker-Albert.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - pro or contra organ donation - there is no one," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken for a re-regulation of the organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would be considered an organ donor unless he or his relatives contradict.
Among other things, the Catholic Church refuses this.
14-year-old pupil is world champion in the head calculation
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in the head calculation.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper told the Science Museum Phaeno, the place of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greeting from Germany was the third place.
The latest WM participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, who was the oldest 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief divorce judge Ralf Laue said.
The computer professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes competition every two years.
Previous tasks were: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, with participants on the audience with a pocket computer.
Wenzel Greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when cracking.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Greeting was two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superhern, genius or wonder child, organizer Laue can hardly start.
"Coupling can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even computing competitions in stages.
Among the disciplines, for example, are the square root pulling from six-digit numbers.
When calculating the versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have good opportunities, said the main divorce judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often benefited because in the early childhood, head calculations are more intensive and with other effective methods being learned.

Government wants to forbid more extremistic symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans a significant expansion of the prohibition of the use of extremist symbols.

Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes her beds for the first time in the west: Polar cold air reaches Monday Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys, it can cut down up to 1,000 meters at strong intensity, it says.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, it is expected to be over 2,000 meters of 20 to 40 centimetres of new snow.
On high-level passports (Arlbergpass, Timmelblick, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the streets are therefore winterly.
Farmers may start on Monday with the annual cracking care
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers may begin on Monday with the annual cick care.
The unique "green forests" in Germany for about 200 years have represented the landscape of the poor state of the forest.
The up to five meters wide tree and trawls are "wholeset" and for many animals and plants the last withdrawal rooms.
Knicks combine as corridors distributed areas where the exchange of organisms can still work, as the Managing Director of the German Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwigowski, said.
Knicks are living tea
The Knicks were established on the basis of a command of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living tea" were not only field limitation and livestock, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and bars for their workhouses.
From that time his name is also called "Knick": By "cnicking" the branches could develop the dense, cursed delimitations.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea, some 45 000 kilometres of the slopes extend and give the picture of a helicoptery, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by about 7000 species as a replacement habitat.
In a kilometre of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and breeze up to 30 bird pairs.
However, his ecologically important function can only fulfill the knick if it is maintained in the winter accordingly.
Otherwise, he carries for a light tree series, which, besides the variety of species, also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
Cnick care may be operated only outside the gross period from October to March, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian speaks about localization
In the interview with the German editorial network (RND) the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and the tsunami:
Were you on the spot during the tsunamis?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at that time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then when I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made myself back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours of car, since the airport was closed on Palu at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid goods can also be flown into.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also been accommodating other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have ranned on surrounding hills, on which they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they do not have access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their houses, there are still postpounds.
Because many food shops and the gas stations are completely closed, people partly clue food and petrol.
The public service has been completely dissolved, the national government helps out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partly running freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island running?
At the moment, we have hand-injection, but it did not work before, and we only got information about the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people, from whom they do not know whether they live and where they stop because people were not at home during earthquakes, for example, on work.
The Tsunami warning system has not worked correctly.
Do you have information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the mistaken information that a tsunami meets the region and they were rendered to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific fire ring, prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst thing.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure is broken down, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.

Board Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in Turbotempo
The time is extremely scarce and the number of planned hearings is strongly limited.
With a FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for the controversial judges board Kavanaugh for demands.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline to Friday to clarify the more than 30 years of suspicious incidents.
The recent turn in the drama around the vocation of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After a eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, during whose course of the jurist raging tiraden against the oppositional democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the Arch Conservative Judge at the Supreme U.S. Court.

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief to Schalke is great after the first season victory.
Nevertheless, against Mainz, the factor time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - Meanwhile it is known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
This wasn't different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our criminal room," said the Sports Board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
Finally, the king's blues were still able to bring the almost 1:0 against the Rhine-hesses over time and thus the first seasonal victory under the roof and specialist.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco had given safety, Tedesco: "The first half was good, both playful and pressing.", with increasing duration of play, apparently more and more of the head played.
Actually, don't shoot a headball immortal
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give that out of their hands and therefore retreated.
And with man and mouse defending Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no essential part of it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the manship."
But at the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start pressurefully during the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we need to handle games over 90 minutes
The biggest manco in the afternoon: King's blue missed it to worry more about clear conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally, e.g. through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the Latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a trembling victory," Tedesco said, "You already felt the fear a little."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only scarf.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at the height of the eyes
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani, stands before them.
He followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild for a repeated time.
"I have made it my task to get interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association who cooperates with the "Culture Policy" alliance in the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani gets very loose into the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject understandably.
With a lot of gestures, hand-resistant numbers and some joke, he brings the listeners one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Despite successful integration, why are there increasing conflicts?
The Syrian author uses the answer to the question of a metaphor.
At one table the German society sits on the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat on the big table and now want to decide.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether one is ordaining politically on the right or on the left, but, "I am for or against an open society?" he stresses.
At first, the discussions are going to be more and more.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee tells from his perspective two teachers how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in pupils.
El-Mafaalani is available, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is on the height of the eyes.
The sociology professor does not press his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fate.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "first when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing period, he has also been a open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the Foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, more intensively discussed.

The municipality of Pliening sold the first property in the new construction area of Landsham-Süd on the free market.
This tells mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 lands that offer the municipality at cheaper conditions or prices - similar to the former local model.

According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as an affordable residential area.
A total of 16 income-oriented apartments supported by the free state.
Space for 200 people
Grob is estimated on the area of the new Landsham-South area for about 200 people.
Not only this: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start is for the rebuilding of a child day place.

So Schalkes Naldo succeeds "great sport" also on the bank
For the third time not in the start elevator: Naldo at Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco, however, thanks.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in a row, not in the Schalker Startel, but in the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the nearly two meters of Brazilians had spoken the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players, after the 1:0 victory over FSV Mainz 05, gathered as usual in the middle circle and thanked chief trainer Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old who calls all the simpleness of Naldo turned in and said, "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his re-reservist life, had no wrath.
Truscheinlích knows Naldo, who was celebrated as the best scarf in the past season, that he actually did not get to the clay of his trainer - but for good reasons gets a break.
One reason called "believed tax".
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I tell you that very honestly," said Tedesco about the moment he had told Naldo that he wasn't in the start elevator.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the association," founded Tedesco the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bavaria and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that all of you can get through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which has also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing himself to the bank as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its valleying in August compared to the euro area.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month depth.
However, Austria has the thirdmost mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands throughout Europe, the Markit Institute informed on Monday about its survey among 3,000 companies.
Unlike Austria, the PMI of the Euro zone rose by 1,1 to 45,1 points, and the index is still the 13th month following the brand of 50 counters that suggest growth.
Only Ireland's industry knacked this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The Greeks were final light (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer dropped, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level of 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened valley trip could mean that the worst thing has survived," said Markit-Ökonom Rob Dobson.
But in the third quarter, the industry remains one growth brake number.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have not fallen as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore degraded the seventh month in succession.
In China, industrial production also fell stronger than initially adopted in August.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had expected 47.8 points at first.
The shopping manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
The developments in turnovers, employment, camps and prices will be raised among other things.
