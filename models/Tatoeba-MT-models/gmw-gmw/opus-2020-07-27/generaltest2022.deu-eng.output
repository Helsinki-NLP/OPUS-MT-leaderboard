The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# Grandma and so it's not a problem for me.
Only need a number or instruction which I should attach to the package so that it can be trampled by you as a return.
I ordered #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today she costs 179€.
I really think that's very angry.
Should I cancel the order and order it again for the better price or is there another possibility of credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be devoted to adopting a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the young.
Let's look a little bit, just help, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough child for themselves, I don't see a problem there.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it's okay for him, it's good.
You're best able to determine whether this fits for your children.
It's not like he's gonna win K2 and accompany it for hours in sleeping.
Just legally, it's probably questionable.
So maybe the psychologist's statement is also coming.
For if actually something should happen like a fire, invasion, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to enter, of course, is your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a criminal / thriller a few years ago, and I can still remember almost all the action, but I don't want to notice the title partout anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story dealt with fear and therapy.
At the beginning of history, a animal nurse commits suicide by surging himself with feed and going to his robbery.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a short investigation of his therapists, is arranged to operate a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a small niece that also has a fear (for fire) and lands at this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is entrusted anonymously before every suicide to go to the place of the suicide and document and put the photos into the Internet.
In any case, this therapist finally shows that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where a chip is planted to the patient, which in the brain suppresses anxiety center and ultimately put the patients in the extreme way of fear.
(a woman jumps out of the window another is going to death intentionally)
This fear is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the gross act I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book I would be very happy.
Oh, ever, I don't have the password for the Wlan.
You need to contact my husband.
But that can take time.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it possible to withdraw the price difference?

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to advance refresh vaccination
There are always new omicron cases of politics and science in the UK.
Therefore, all qualified adults in England are expected to receive an vaccination offer until the new year.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to advance even faster in the Corona vaccination of vigilance due to rapidly rising omicron numbers than so far.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose until the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will further support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the districts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omicron variant, one is faced with an emergency, which is why the vaccination protection must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection could be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Let's get angry!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other omicron cases were registered in Great Britain, with the total number rising to 3137.
Compared to the day before, this was an increase by 65 percent.

I am for everyone to imagine with pronoms
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not a "peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I picked him up and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I don't know how to write the email now.
Can anybody help me?
** I am foreigners and don't want to stop officials from taking their feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine with pronoms.
Got a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them.
Only that one I bought today isn't going.
Obviously, the chair had an unseen deficiency on sale.
How can such a pollen damage occur after 9 months otherwise ?
Only tried on #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working since ca.
No longer 14 days.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now they are again available and I would like to add 2 chairs to the order and invoke it to me.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content warning: I'll write something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
For occupational reasons, I (21) come more often into contact with the victims (and offenders) of domestic violence.
A topic that is really naked to me and, unfortunately, it is too common that many victims do not let themselves help or think we couldn't help them.
I'm quite clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation with four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range I cannot reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's anxiety to fear revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of withdrawing the children from this.
Whatever I want to make everyone clear, partly even very close to the tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never makes it easier.
Please, remember, you're worth living without violence, that's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the series about "League of Legends"?

Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster John Patrick was abandoned.
Again nothing: For the second time within not even three months, the giant lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's trainer John Patrick had said with a look back on the Pokal deposit at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October: "We have a little wrath in the abdomen."
However, it did not lie after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) - lower position in the basketball bandesliga.
Moreover, more than the naked result was disappointed by the way in which the performance occurs.
Deputy is called a statistic that expresses the whole dilemma: The three quotes were just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 trials - more questions?
The answer was John Patrick: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife and did not implement what we had trained."
It's the ball to move.
Another thing was his counterpart about Sebastian Gleim: "To win a game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe-Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least also because of BBL topscorer T.J. Shorts, which marked 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever trained," praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team, even the players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giant prevented a total debakel and arrived up to eight points after they had already placed back 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon came at twelve points.
Fortunately, a lot of time to haven't stayed.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giant receives the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have another addresses, but I changed them.
Yeah, I've reported myself a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all guarantee claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed again, and we have written them again.
We originally reported ourselves half a year ago.
Always peeled out of the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He can enthusiasm his audience with new interpretations of strokes from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the way with the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" - if he may occur.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday at the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there's nothing about it.
The planned concert was posted in May 2022 - "on authoritative instruction" to embrace the Corona virus.
Other of the events planned at the Advent time must be seen as the singer's website, which becomes 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists then want to retrieve their dates that have already been posted in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has sang a lot and enjoyed singing.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the palace orchestra together with Kommilitonen.
Since then the bariton has established itself with its repertoire of strokes and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded a lot with prices.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his success album "For women this is no problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly knocked back and covered on labels, Max Raabe is no longer to remember from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by disability
The new Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has expressed itself against the unacceptability of large housing companies, as it was requested in Berlin in a referendum.
"With a disapproval, no new apartment is created, it only changes the owner structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sonday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent remains affordable in the next few years.
By the way, a fine mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition from SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission, how to deal with the outcome of the people's decision.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not exclude conversations with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further reinforcements in the rental law.
The coalition contract provides a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of tenants increases in tensile housing markets and the expansion of the rental level.
I'll talk to the Minister of Justice to implement it as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 dead by Tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornados have been pulled through the USA.
Only in Kentucky could be more than 100 dead to be complained.
The pictures from there remember a war zone.
In the night on Saturday, several tornados have set up severe destructions in the United States and may have demanded up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave about 320 kilometres of desolation, especially in the Member State of Kentucky.
After a visit to the disaster area, the governor Andy Beshear said that everything was gone wherever the Tornado was pierced.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He expects only in the Member State of Kentucky, with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rise hourly.
Hello, I've just seen that she's sold out Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is it still produced?
Or is she taken from the assortment?
Is there the possibility of ordering this vitrine in another country?
Until when do you report?
If the delivery cannot be done in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, just can I order the ceiling now and deliver it to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned a Artike via the contact form or gave up a return and wanted to ask if it was arrived or processed, as I had not received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for an vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are therefore on a line with the ÖGB and Economic Chambers, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising logans to vaccination - according to German example - is also intended to increase the willingness to corona implications.
He has changed to a company that he has been harassing.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year ago.
He obviously did not go to his old place and sought something else.
You can do that, too.
And he didn't think you were good at that time.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.

Assistance in first-owned campaign
Boron to the barbecue!
I just lead for a group of 4 friends the adventure About the grip pass and wants to lead my hero seamlessly into a specially written campaign for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the evil weights and their motivations written, the individual acts designed and now I am writing the entrance adventur and stolper already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that heroes should bring a flock of grain from Gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran Sea.
There the further action is to develop.
Some miles away from the village, the hero is supposed to pick up a group of Goblin's and lock it into a backdrop.
I would like to give the players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convince, act, threatening, recognise the danger early, whatever the players are.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bowls and seals
If they do not notice, the Goblin's run up the hero in a hollow path and flank to three left and on the right, the watchwork arms me, while two with spears stop the watchwork.
If it comes to the fight and the hero are subject, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are found and healed by the son of the village school, a half elevator.
Of course, the car is gone.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable just this half elevation with two of his servants and come to help the hero in the battle.
The car is still here, all right.
How fitting do you hold Deus ex Machina of solution 2?
Is the encounter as an entry into the adventure too much?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I've built the lamp out again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately it still doesn't work.
That's why I would like to send her back anyway.
Then if you can let the backlights come, I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm generated by Sky Sport F1
Hi, dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on German sky has increased, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, the transmission was canceled today in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 pre-reporting timely.
Although the delayed start and the start accident of the timetable was far behind the planning, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the mastership decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 has priority and therefore needs to limit everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, since Sky UK sent the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Blackyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then, in the F1 again, there was regular insight on the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that the tyres may be changed under a red flag.
Although there was this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that stepping can change the tyres when there were corresponding radio claims on this topic to Hamilton.
With Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for stepping.
I think that such basic rules should be known simply if you comment on the F1 on a pay-TV sender.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the issue of rules.
Generally not liked with the artistic comment style of Roos, but admit that the taste is a matter.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL.
In addition, constant alivenesses that let both simply unprofessionally work, such as the ordering of coffee in the reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of trouble in the comment that he does not seem to take this seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes overhand at Sky, in the runout is Sky the only broadcaster who goes to the advertising, how to listen to F1TV, because only the German sound track without comment has to come out right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as free TV channels.
Although you have to praise glock and tree gardeners for their work, it alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very short and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the poorest German-speaking channel that transmits the F1.
Unironic makes RTL to the advertising a better job at the four races they can still transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# Pendellight, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and I haven't got anything.
The First Lady told me it was sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the substance has a hole on the front of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent to provide an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole plants with it.
If you have a large aquarium, you can have pumps with 2 or more outputs so that you can connect several outflowers.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on model fan pumps, but also offer to put an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure trump, a shell or a similar name.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed design and thus provides low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an Auströmer o.a. by means of an air hose 4/6 mm...and it can go away.
The ventilator pump should be equal or higher than the water level and be applied outside.
If the fan pump is deeper than the water level, you should put a relapse valve between it.
Just cut through the air hose and put the valve between it.
This would prevent if once water would run back that the water runs out of the pool through the pump...
If the ventilator pump should be installed outside, you, like other air pumps, should be covered and protected from moisture
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we here in ebay specify the processing time with 3 days, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also picked up here daily.
It's all right on the way, it's very fast.
We just want to avoid a little, so that no one is voted, just because it lasted a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding of all the employees who work in the supply industry too... of course no corona does.
Please don't evaluate the same badness just because the delivery delays, that's exclusively due to the package services.
Of course, you like to be shaken about these services, even if we say at the moment... they've got it fucking hard.
This is also very different regionally.
If no one is evil, stay healthy and we all hope that there are better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can you order your legs in hell too?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to the worldall
The daughter of the first American in the world, a TV engineer and four other passengers have made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the Blue Origin company of Amazon-Gründer Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under radiant blue sky, Bezo's most personally received the freshly cursed astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were travelling ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of 1961 as a Nasa astronaut, flew Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which the blue Origin rocket system was named, and the 50-year-old TV engineer Michael Strahan were guests of the company who paid four passengers for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology businessman Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not inform.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminiscent of her father's mission after a short flight.
He had to work hard in his operations and do everything himself.
She was just like that, said the 74-year-old with a laughter.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He'd liked to return to the All once again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometres of height
The "New Shepard" missile system is largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometres above the earth, temporarily with gravity, before the reusable object braked off from large parachutes again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres above the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third man-made all-excursion of Blue Origin: At the first in July Amazon founder Bezos was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old U.S. pilot and a 18-year-old Dutch.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the vice-chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Criticians suggest Bezos and Blue Origin to promote business with space tourism largely without scientific interest in the welfare of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemia or has studied biochemia
I am currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and actually find the subject quite exciting and even in the laboratory I am not disturbed (have already the inorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I have also informed myself about professional prospects before studying, but also thought at the time that I intend to study and become until the promotion.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, particularly impressing my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck, etc) you are hearing super occupational opportunities and the job is totally searched, on the other hand you are hearing from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I would really be interested:
1) What are you currently working?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What have you studied/What training did you do?
4) Would you do this all the time?
Thank you very much for your answers!
I am currently really insecure and consider 2022 may break off the study and make a training as a professional informatist.
If you have experiences there, they also like to write times :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only a punch.
Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
As it seems, it's the day before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: last week, Mariä Himmelfahrt, which is called "rising" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week it was a long 4-day week-to-day person in the house.
So what was going last week?
Stress all over.
Lauter e-mails, which needed to go out before ascension, order here, all *unconditioned* before the long weekend.
Because... because?
Because "nearest week" sounds after so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people want to pay all serious things in a shorter week as much as in a normal?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday then, but also vigorously nervous.
What is this self - enthusiasm about holidays?
What do we have to do with holidays if we are not allowed to give them properly?!
The stress did not come from the top, the colleagues were all very independently so on it.
My question is simple: Are we just like that, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical kind?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, you're just going to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the festival by baking and basting with her son.
"I love this," said Catterfeld.
But until the thoughtful days, she has to do something: "For the first time, I have no gifts yet, I have to get rid of now."
NECTON-Bio supports a smooth process of the mouses and feather reconstruction.
NECTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird keeping is exclusively due to diet failure.
Since the feather consists of protein-containing substance, the bird’s bird’s rich and balanced protein nutrition is a prerequisite for the formation of an easy-to-use feather cloth.
For a working metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occur during mouses are based on lack of or unbalanced protein consumption and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON-Bio, the unfavourable proportion of amino acids in most plant feedingstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NECTON-Bio.
NECTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via the drinking water or through the soft feed.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately still not working
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, Lok was in use in Schlesien and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the reconstruction suggestion of the model iron trainer ME Heft 11/1968, used with game tracks and miscellaneous parts see photos, function well, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electrocomomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the tractory of heavy coal tires in the Schlesian network, may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Salee) and we operated
The German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had in 1924 commissioned the AEG to present proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200 tons of coal trains and 530 tons of passenger trains with 45 km/h travel speed.
As a maximum speed, 65 km/h were required.
Thus, in March 1926 the DRG defined the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' Locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the supply of the mechanical component, the Siemens scooters with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the supply of six locomotives received E 95 01–06 was made.
All survived World War II and then found themselves back on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives came to the Soviet Union as a repair property.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnenverbesserungswerk Dessau, the recruitability of all six locomotives was detected.
[4] When progressive reelectrification of the medium-German network showed a growing need for locomotives for the heavy freight service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed in 1959, while the other machines served as a spare part donor.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 were preferred in larger numbers.
Only when the E 94 saw that the number of revisions could not be further increased, the E 95 took the viewpoint of the revision.
[4] The locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to Halle P.
They were usually used in a circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geisel Valley towards Hall, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematically, with increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be.
Thus, it often happened that shooters remained sticking in switching bargainings.
Then, on this locomotive, the constantly moving beeman with hammer and wooden bowl had to dissolve the shooter during the ride.
Damage to the motors often occurred and led to months of failure in the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new construction locomotives and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at the time, the emerging train could be disposed of on old locomotives and most splitter holes, so that the E 95 were disposed of.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electrolocomotives only once more, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the problems mentioned with the machines and the views of the leadership.
[5] After mid-1969 the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were released, they followed the E 95 01, which quit the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
All locomotives were broken up until the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a Weichenheizanlage on the main train station Halle.
It took some time to convince those responsible at the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was worth obtaining as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the outer workout of the locomotive began to present it to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was made.
In the DB Museum Hall (Salee) the locomotive is supervised.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational work of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotives could be presented for the first time as an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and external lacquering, with the transformers being checked and five drivers are capable of operation.
-The locomotives were in use by 1945 on the Schlesische Bergbahn and the declining trails, where they proved to be on the basis of their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main area of use was first in Schlesien
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical post-working on the locomotive in own work necessary, dusted, with game tracks, cellar smell !!!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition- may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN

Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people have easily been injured in a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area occurred, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire was probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were sent to the hospital on Sunday with light smoking poisoning.
The exact cause of fire was not at first known, but the police did not assume a deliberate fire extinguishment.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it's going to come much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To devote Fake-News - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Çahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Biontech Chief Uğur Çahin had not spoken publicly to his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo that shows his Corona Impact.
The disease of a friend moved him to this, Çahin informed.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Çahin, published a photo that shows how to receive an vaccination against the Coronavirus.
In the social media, there was false information that I wasn't supposedly vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Çahin on Friday in a contribution on the "LinkedIn network".
"Since a few months, friends have urged me to post a photo from me, on which I am vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has refused that because communication should not turn around himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply sorrowed when I learned that an old school friend from me is currently fighting for his life.
He fights against a severe covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Çahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most frequent cause, however, seems to be anxious, often caused by misinformation and distrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experience.
On the Internet, an interview with the German wave, in which Uğur Çahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German wave itself clarified.
"I am currently not allowed to get the vaccine itself," said Çahin at that time.
In Germany, there is a priority for vaccination of the vacuum.
In the meantime, the priority has been lifted long - and the Biontech chef has been implanted three times according to appropriate information.
Fire in circulation plant: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no longer electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had a circular station lahmed.
After a fire with severe damages in a circulation station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have to escape without electricity for about 24 hours.
The fire left the lights on Friday evening with 4,000 people affected in several municipalities.
The West Network provider reported that on Saturday there were numerous emergency power aggregates in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely remedyed late evening.
Firemen and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the persons concerned for their patience and the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought substantial restrictions.
We also thank the municipalities, the circle, the firemen and the THW for the inexperienced use," said Florian Witt, head of primary technology, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take into account a few days, since the West Network moneurs were able to take some lines only provisionally back in operation, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company information.
Power flows again
The fire broke out on Friday at 19.15 p.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt scalt plant in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid Surrounding Station.
There are excess cleaning and repair work required.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt-spacing level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday, 18 o'clock, over 2,000 people have had electricity again in Much and Ruppichteroth.
Other 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually assigned from 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 a.m., the last ones still had electricity from the failure.
More than 80 Monteures of West Network and partner companies have been in use.
After building an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens take care of older or single people in their neighborhood and share with local firearms houses when there is a need for help," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the construction and operation of emergency power aggregates, the residents of Old Homes were focusing on it.
Furthermore, according to the authorities, temporary care sites in schools have been established for those who have not been able to provide themselves or who need power-dependent medical devices or who are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euro?
It is the day deck #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't assemble it on the tableboard.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of that.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I cannot put it together and therefore shorten it.
Can you help me?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased about a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then we'll do it.
Do you send me the return card by mail?
the repair is now completed.
I had tried this before the chat.
Before buying, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I'm almost ashamed of such a low credit.
We do not agree with this.
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combinations Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have been printed on the podest at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepäe.

Retour of order number #NUMBER#
When is the money transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have made both of them new and use the version 4.5...
Maybe they have already heard of problems in many cases.
Got directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it seems to be on it too.
Sobal I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
You may be incorrectly reporting to your customer service.
As far as I can recognize it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in the meantime.
To ensure that the colour order becomes uniform and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, wash and dry with clear water.
Before bringing the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 stripes.
You can do that on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly along the line.
Light overlap of the layers of color later creates an even surface.
Avoid swiveling quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden sun.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark could otherwise look through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to unpleasant metal slides when they mix themselves with normal colours.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them.
Originally faithful appearance reaches the models through the decals or declining images.
From high-performance signs on planes to ship names to decorative bars and marks at car models: The Decals give the model the last sleeve.
Put the decals in the right order as long as the components can still be achieved well.
A plane cockpit can or may be easier clothed before it is built into the romp.
More important than the right tool, such as scissors, pinstones and toothtochers, are time, patience and a calm hand when clinging.
Cut each Decal needed and put it down for you.
Decals are also called water sliding images because you moist their backs shortly with water until the carrying paper is darkened through the wets.
Then you just move the picture a small piece of paper and put the piece on the corresponding position on the model (which you have also moisted before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper off the side.
Attention: Always check if the image is sitting properly before you move it completely from the paper so that it doesn't stick, knitter or even rip.
Sucking overnight water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book shortly as soon as I look at something else then I don't read the book anymore and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the place to where I read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this via email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 single packages
Thank you very much.
Then I'll buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
But do I get that back without problems?
Child Deal with PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were a few time in child request treatment, now when it comes to the accounting with the PKV, it suddenly quenched.
The row after:
We had requested the child’s desire in advance at the PKV and received the commitment over 3 trials.
The trials have not been restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was counted with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (successless) trials, but they did not yet expect the PKV.
We again requested the cost acquisition at the PKV and received 3 further trials.
After some further trials (we have made more attempts than promised, logically expect the most expensive with the PKV) we entered the invoices at the PKV and received the evil surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3), the PKV wants to pay only 3 trials.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first promise expire.
The second child's wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to TGB, "The insurance case starts with healing, it ends when treatment needs no longer exist."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to reimburse the PKV (only 3 trials are repayed) or we (it's 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Should the PKV have to point out in the commitments that with birth the further trials have passed?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (conditioned by closed egg ladders) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to get them the best
All right.
We won't order anything with them anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (equal address), they obviously have lost good customer.
They'll be happy to pass that on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was caused and now tell me I have to send back the thing.
I'm sure I can't do anything for the cocktail gets completely disturbed with me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear and clear that the repayment has been triggered and I have still not received a repayment by #PRS_ORG#
You can justify their manager that they have now lost two standard customers.
My friend has also ordered several furniture for our apartment via his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
A office chair must keep a normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as a office chair.
In any event, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, I can't get another type of packaging.
I will dispose of the cabinet and be able to make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be applied with additional hockers, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is precisely, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low budget film** or **low budget film** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the network you can find rich lists of low-budget movies, such as zB on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's the matter with you?
And what do you think you don't like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, already have 2 apartments completely furnished with your furniture.
Wanted the best price for the grey leatherofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it reliable now?
Thank you.
With friendly greetings
If there's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes to the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Halfer Sieg" against Belarus linked to high costs for the EU
The EU can, in conflict with the Belarusian regime, proclaim a "half victory" to the political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU did not solve the confrontation sustainably, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) explained.
This state of silence - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels as winners - is probably going on for a while.
The relationship with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
It seems that there is an "increasing normalisation of Pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decisively oppose it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development, at the same time, weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It is apparent that it can't stand up when a Member State is headed to make its thing," as currently Poland, which does not even allow Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU paid another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: a principle agreement on asylum policy is difficult because the line "Great protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Retry of the cross-border
According to Poland’s border protection, migrants have attempted to reach across Belarus in Polish areas again.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday at night and returned to the border, said a spokesman of the authority on Sunday.
On the occasion of the incident near Czeremsza, the Polish officials had been defeated by the migrants with stones.
According to the information, a soldier was faced and had to be cared for by a military doctor.
Overall, the border protection registered 52 attempted crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border locks.
Thousands of countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU suggests Alexander Lukaschenko as a captain in Minsk to have attracted them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reported that press reports collapsed border sections.
The EU sank Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to stop traveling there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the scale and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandays and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also needs to take into account internal policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not obsessed that the security device regularly slides thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula-1 Final
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula 1 Finale, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The silver pillars suspect two regular breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety-car phase when he is supposed to have overwhelmed.
A second objection was filed against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes view, the protocol was not regularly followed.
In the last round of Lewis Hamilton, Verstappen had been frozen in the Mercedes and was frozen to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety-car phase in which the Dutch had taken over driving cars in front of him.
I'm examining this.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again.
Thanks for the support

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also served as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitive to the nightly sounds at her door.
I gave up yesterday the contact form for returning an article but did not receive an e-mail confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my question has been raised.
It hasn't everyone's time for your chat and wrongly delivered bills from China.
Your mistake, you're fixing, and not all of our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had shattered yesterday and agreed that I or Ms. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# night table and a return label.
This email hasn't come until now.
The package still wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

But only because he says he's not an anti-Semit, it doesn't mean anything.
It's as if an abdler says he doesn't have anything against foreigners.
I don't give it to both of them.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distant yourself, you should just leave it completely.
Yes, you're not as serious as Kollegah.
Those who seriously question evolution are simply completely lost.
For my sake, a God has brought the whole thing into motion.
But as soon as you are creative, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is only unclean.
And that's what you're a scientist and not taking any more seriously, like Kollegah.
In order to maintain an optimal vision field, the magnitude should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the lupe to the edge zone virtually for forgiveness and colorless error.
Lupes are often marked with magnification details.
However, these information shall only apply to precisely defined conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
To be able to use your magnifier optimally, we ask you to note the indications in the table "Technical Data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices – also in the case of lupes – light reflections arise.
By an antireflex coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - magnifying close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.

Dance sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curiose situation when selling tons.
One time, even without his partner, a man was supposed to have gone home because both couldn't agree.
Each year he plants well 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curiosis situation.
That's always funny for the past night, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I have received a broken delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I'm going to evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to talk about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning spit.
And so both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be like the "dreher", which doesn't sound so delicious at all.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber closure in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have now problems building a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit up to a few accidents.
The new fibre closure sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also arrives.
However, at the other DLan module, which sends the wifi, no longer reach the full 500, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less comes on (e.g. use a connector that is 1, 2, 3, etc. Rooms from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber closure is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than DLan, but there were similar major losses here too.
Could anyone explain to me why with glass fiber so much Internet speed goes "lost" over the power line?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely challenging to put cables in the house LAN.
I'm really desperate, so I've created an account here.
That is why I would be more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to change the giro account
Whoever thought it was the first time to be quiet with the girokonts, looks deceived.
While many banks have used autumn to allow their customers to confirm the fees increases in the past with all kinds of tricks, the free amounts for negative interest continue to fall.
For example, with a limit of EUR 100.000, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous.
Now she just halfed the free amount and even celebrated for the day's money.
In a first step, the border was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 Euros for Giro and Investment Accounts and to 25,000 Euros for Day Money Accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with stock customers".
The Commerzbank had already dropped to a limit of EUR 50,000, which still applies, as well as to the ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, currently popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks, according to numbers of the Internet portal Verivox now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal debate with consumer centres that have even been entitled to this regulation in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin.
The banks are already discussing whether the institutions should make provisions - in case the upper instances also explain the negative interest rates in principle unpermissible and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.
The table was delivered for 8 people instead of those for 6 people.
The lower is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at Hollywood's top.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who made Furore in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers cares for their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she will give herself a chip on the day (yes, read correctly: a single chip from the bag).
That you still flee to the hearts of the female and male fans in the same way is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has pech with luck - and still looks for the great love.
And the baby wish removed from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she was now mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Stay hoping that also make success and glory happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was still quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled out the gloves and wiped the sweat from the forehead.
That's it.
After a ride error and a light band touch, Räikkönen had not even half of the race dance to put his Alfa Romeo at the Great Price of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motor sports king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was the profit of the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He created 21 Grand Prix victory, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich holt 60. World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the twoerbob - Sports
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björndale with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I thought this time, I had to go in for nine and a half victories per season, then I could create it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympiager from the BSC Oberbeerburg, who made two successes in two days during the Winterberg race.
Only on Saturday he refused the attack of Johannes Lochner at five hundredths, in which he went to one from rank three.
Then he changed something about the material setting and went out a greater advantage on Sunday at 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbeerburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he went in front of the British Brad Hall.
==References====External links==
"We have gone greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22th victory in series.
The Berchtesgaden Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came to place two times before this time on rank five.
Christoph Hafer from the BC Bad Feilnbach landed after Range four in the first race at place eight.
"If I knew what he did differently, I would do it like that," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte took the third season victory in the two legs on her homeway.
On the day before it was only for the fourth place in the Monobob, she cracked on Sunday at the German Triple success with Deborah Levi to the World Cup victory.
Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia, two olympicians from the BRC, came to Range with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to its Olympic Qualification, she booked the first podstplatz in this winter.
Kim Kalicki, Wiesbadener, landed with Leonie Fiebig on place three.
For me it was supercool, first podest place in the world cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I'm superb with the development.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times were okay today," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just pushing, but there's also a huge deal to do."
Jamanka angryed a little about the not quite mistaken rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I had the ceiling already in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn't get him and therefore couldn't trigger him, so I finally asked.
By Corona last year I had quite different problems and never time for it.
And now he called it was expired what is very angry with me.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seating bank.
I would like to give it back and order it again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipping only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No until I get on tippe a extra field with the message
Was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered war.
But we want the Regal module anyway, just a new uninjured
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, only until XY...
Hello dear girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write, and maybe the one or others are going to...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog emama - just apart from that my dog doesn't shout or go to the kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, has taken a second degree of burning on Monday and has been depressive for years (but now in therapy).
Yesterday, I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have a lot shuffled and it was beautiful.
I helped him to shower (because hand is in the band wg burning).
He is cooled above and we are seeing ourselves at present less (1-2x week) which makes me feel very concerned with my needs for affection and love.
My dog's kid just got buckweh, I cooked for him and now he's in his cocktail and has relaxed a little after I was there with the warmth lamp and strapping for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and it's just gone for a month.
Now we will also have homework on us, which we will of course divide.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is very well maintained, I am halfways well therapied and come right.
Not good, but I'm right and almost symptom-free.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I haven't yet done and over morning anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I'll have a oral exam on Tuesday, and what's going on in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space anymore.
So my week goes like this: Just up to over morning, then it's weekend.
But after that, is this all going on?
Just until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Just to the weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'm packing that ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I don't...
Is that what you're doing?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely thankful, I can't put that in words at all.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs elsewhere.
I think that also has some of the things to do with Mental Load of Women, and that's why I thought I'd surely find people here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week's almost done!
I got my order today, unfortunately, the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
In the first delivery, the colour was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to exchange the table now, I get another color or how?
The mail for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
For the rest, two times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
At that time, I found that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is only another subject for them, such as mathematics or Earth science.
For me it was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and I always believed somehow.
What are you doing?
Perhaps you can also tell about working and study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to divide.
Given a curriculum, etc.
But just find it strange to have a physicist who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What, then, brings you to want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
True culture or something like that?
Hope you're not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Write like English I understand that well
That's a long time, then I'd disapprove of it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a feedback by the beginning of the next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Search for movies Please help
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (in 24).
I think it's been a movie for adolescents.
In the film there are two time axles (or parallel worlds).
First of all the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (Uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross themselves and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live myself, I mean.
I believe the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers fight against each other.
If you say something I'm grateful for any answer.
Our little one just slept on the stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
That's how a child keeps much more out than you think.
Make sure everything is right around here, not kissing animals, often going in and watching, but no minutes of monitoring.
That makes you mad!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
Don't kisses.
Achso and we had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it get out of the abdomen?
Or is it with the face ahead right in the mattress?
That's what you can do. It's all right.
We have also all grown up, and when my husband came to the world, it was, for example, going to have the kids placed on the stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "stamkunde" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote yesterday with a colleague from you and no feedback.
It's about my clothes cabinet that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used at this time.
To make it clear.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
Bloß it is simply so that the policy of this broadcaster is now under all sauce.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a large bedling tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet channel.
Zitat Arno: You want to be "no running litfaß pillars".
What are you doing?
A 0815 advertiser who tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don's.
The natural ones apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms is trying to make ashes.
How can you find this all right?
It's great if you like it, I think it's horrible.
I'm asking for a call, because my delivered wooden table was defected.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so I should still work.
I thought the power supply alone is enough to operate.
Missing display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged power.
Then I've grown up the battery, but there's nothing to do here.
You got ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network operation?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like to deliver the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is....
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 backpack of Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems that can be safely scattered using the polstered FlexFold participants.
And what else you need on everyday items remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is still present in a new look.
The skillful, minimalistic design has it in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that protect the interior of the backpack reliablely and still provide access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the lid fold, which can be locked with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proved itself in the Messenger Bags.
There is a locker of metal with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of different "fill stands": there are 4 anchor bars, stablely destroyed, which can be hacked into the shutter.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper.
Lock and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be closed reliablely without torn the hooks.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from others, photo backpacks: Apart from the lid fold, there is still a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from the top - you don't have to wake by the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail enormously increases the everyday fitness of the backpack: not only if you take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or baggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more below) and thus disturb both problemlessly separately - and access independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main case, while the everyday items are safely in the left backpack and do not get between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable wear straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# hasn't left me yesterday an email from confirmation for the commissioning of

Until now, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking for immediately finishing.

It is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
It's gonna stop when the cabinet could be delivered again?
It's not an option for me to keep him like this...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Do you want a nice evening?
hallo, my order is #NUMBER#. When is the article delivered?
Order and payment was 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher to me, I will give up a larger order, but I have always kept the damaged furniture piece and not sent back.
And that last year I couldn't know the same way as I thought, and I couldn't make it timely and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, to appreciate reliability and safety when braking also under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brakes are made of cast and processed mechanically (burned and cut).
All thin discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical properties, which are owned for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which aims with the elasticity of the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The thin discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
In addition, openings created increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, while the cuttings improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake locks.
Aesthetic properties of our thin discs underline the character of each car by attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event expressed the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered bricks in the water at the southern giftation of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and dissolved the so-called "California Gold Rush" from ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were sealed, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were almost overnight.
Everyone wanted its share in the wealth of the country.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, group horses, and build businesses.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and neighbouring areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You need to overtake your pioneer colleagues in order not to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You select your actions simultaneously, you have to build households with your resources and a tableau which is more and more "working" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules to your favour.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridges, you can develop your individual style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained the official state).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will select a place secretly and at the same time on the schedule where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is discovered and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, he gets a lock!
This deactivates the half of the location - which reduces possible actions there.
Then players perform alternating actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolverhelds.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the awarder turns to a new location and thereby alters the available actions.
This continues until the awardee has moved five times, so every location has once covered and ends the year.
There is a shooting in which the players must defend Coloma before a attack of angry bandites.
If the players have contributed enough revolts and the bandites are superior to the number, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end at the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player wins with most victories!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychic violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
> The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is enjoyed by a guest in Talkshows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrannians" (2008) he triggered a severe debate on education.
Former patient: women and teachers now raise severe accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible people should never, never, go for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the frame for the child as much as it is useful and possible in the situation.
Brur, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise about the failure of the test requirement for three times vaccinated
At its next meeting, the Ministers of Health of the countries want to decide on a non-country removal of the test requirement for three times vaccinated.
"We countries need rapid clarity, whether and from when for three times vaccinated, the test requirement can be withdrawn," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The removal of 2G plus for three times vaccinated is "not only medically useful, but also additional vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) said that "he will make a proposal for the Health Minister's Conference on the next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back.
How do I do the best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more about my #PRS_ORG# shopping.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page goes on the computer.
I've updated account data.
What can be this?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, that is, sense perceptions under full narkosis.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/stimmes, rare to see pictures and most rare to perceive pain.
Relevant for this topic: Emperor cuts are surgeries that go along with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep narkosis is avoided for the protection of the child until revelation.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the narkose interview.
Certain anaesthesia such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment from me, although Awareness is correct, but has had** u/Nitemarex **per definition no.
Have read their comment incorrectly.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ do not help us either.
These are legal guarantee claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the broken chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please check them again if they take the broken chair back at least.
Then we sell the second chair privately.
That's where we're losing some money.
I sent you a mail that you didn't answer.
The question again.
In order and in the bill, the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The specialist is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they were delivering only before the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know a person who can wear the heavy furniture in the first floor.
Will I not call?
I had presented a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old died
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intent.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, printed: "An old man gets older."
The shocking diary of a slow departure from the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the message comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I've been witnessing my thought of life here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most frequent are Europeletts, standard wooden pallets, which are mainly used as cargo carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Paletten Association EPAL
According to statistics in Austria, in 2020, over ten million pallets were produced.
The production value was approximately EUR 79 million.
How many palettes are imported to Austria annually, will not be collected
New York gets MLS mastership for the first time
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in the regular time of play against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the Elfmeter shooting with 4:2.
In the finale of the Eastern Conference, New York had committed itself against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Raw Tips & Tricks
I had got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect Gulasch.
That was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butter kind!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I came to the taste and would like to cook rouladen in Silvester for the first time.
Tomorrow I'm gonna put on a bovine fountain for that.
Do you still have any tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but only a big pot.
How are you doing now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't so good anymore, but I get that
I'm about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today, the money hasn't come in with me.
Please check there.
Where there are still Christmas breads in Lübeck's room
For many people, Gans or Ente is one of the Christmas days such as the tanning tree and the gifts.
You haven't got a poultry yet?
Now the time is getting short.
We'll tell you where you're still going to get a Christmas bread in Lübeck's room.
The "drive" of a pipe end level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor-keeping.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME regulators, you can set the desired peak and, on the other hand, the cracking content of your sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator with which you can reduce the sound level without changing something on the "gain" and the distortion.
The above already sounded that with the POWER LEVEL regulator you can even fleet a power reserve when it comes to loud loudly.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL regulators, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphones can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a box simulation so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or direct recording.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX book so you can jamme to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
Those who also donate a VFS5 foot-checker can also call the sounds by foot, turn the impact blocks on/off, and get the pace of the compatible effects.
This is really indispensable for the live use.
With its new power packages, VOX goes a further step into the future!
But it saw it with others like that.
Can you then send the lamp back?
Because she's hanging too low over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me?
What about the fashion?
Do we receive another update for the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it wasn't, I would be satisfied with a retirement or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are something much.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know whether screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (Tür) on the intended hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded

Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on the renewal of the International Atomic Agreement, progress has been made according to Iranian information.
"Both sides are short of agreeing on the topics to be held on the agenda," said Iran's chief dealer Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first, there has not even been agreement on the subjects to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna discussions on the renewal of the agreement were continued after just one week interruption.
The negotiation will take part in the negotiations of Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia.
A U.S. delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia conquered Saxony - Free State now Bundesland with highest Corona-Inzidenz
Thuringia has dissolved Sachsen and is currently showing the highest inzidency in Germany.
The only federal country is the value above the 1000 brand.
As a single federal country, Thuringia was located at the Corona incident on Sunday above the 1000 brand.
The Robert Koch Institute indicated the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100.000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always shown the highest inzidency in Germany, this value was on Sunday at 99,5.5.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia was slightly dropped, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections were reported with the Sars CoV-2-virus and 16 more deaths related to an infection.
200 severely in Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly coming after the recording of new cases.
I understand.
As the delivery takes place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and stick on the package and give it to the post, that was it, or?
I don't have to click on/and fill in here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I write you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a frequent in my eyes.
It's time for changes
###MBundestag I have been greeted, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can find one: it is not extinguished.
We came into a winter street and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to dissatisfaction, as some things have passed out here and as we are generally present.
In the last days, the impression has increased that many here really still have bock on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the Community is asked about the MBundesday which it wants to live.
The attack came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last days and, simply said, has found a hop of scissors.
After some, several people have found themselves from the Community who are pleased to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on all to participate in this project, only so can this project have an existence in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server where we can exchange each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How is the MBundestag supposed to work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we appear outside in the future?
* How should new members be purchased?
* How do we create a fair choice system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but what's not bad, we've got the discord at the end.
If you want and have time, come to the discord, work with and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lamp screen with you that's still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/closing for it and not suitable for my taste.
I already ordered a different suspension for that.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also pretty sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day deck #PRS_ORG#, are there also in oversize, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty closet will be picked up at a time.
And I'm asking you to make it right now.
I don't have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the closet as far as possible for pick-up - they need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to agree a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get them or to decide for the return?
How do you answer the question why you're vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She himself has lived vegetarically for a while, at present probably eats very rare times meat.
I myself was also a few years ago vegetarian.
On the question whether I always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thinking.
And I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian, I would support the animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I finally also support animal torture.
That is why my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that came up on her side, she then defended vegetarism and meant that she knew where her meat came from and they were reduced as a vegetarian animal grief.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that a Veganer is fast put into a corner and that conflicts arise without which one would make it.
It greets a harmonious veganist (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not disconnect from the statutory requirements for the distance.
I am on the assigned date where #PRS_ORG# does not get my return on site.
Since I can't be on the spot because of a funeral, it is unfortunately not possible to change that.
Please, an alternative pick-up date can be assigned to me.
As of 01.02.#NUMBER#, I'm constantly coming back.
Lahnsteine Wehr for Water Rescue Equipped: EUR 45,000
Recently, the Rhineland-Pfalzian Minister of Interior Roger Lewentz in the Lahnstein City Hall delivered a total of 45,000 euros for the new appliance car Water rescue of the Voluntary Fire Force Lahnstein to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonnet.
The total costs of the vehicle in use since November 2020 amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the country of Rheinland-Pfalz supports us with this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, you are constantly expecting rising interventions: The tree of the hotel shipbuilding on Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the loan as a leisure flow contributes to this.
I bought a book I could only read 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, synchronized, removed, and the app reloaded NOTS worked.
I'm frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and hopes for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the ordering process?

Thank you for putting you the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in a similar activity, we were also armors in the executive, I wouldn't want to go on with it!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
But basically, it should be said that, of course, the minister of State is more of the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not of the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, that even in the special uniform and armor carriers, people on the right of conservative magic should also be clear that these people can hardly deal with the living reality, of course, because, of course, you have, besides the average white, now many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and that I do not mean now, the exaggerated feminine clichés, because they are in the executive rather less than never but quite normal men and women to whom one can not tell it) and also to these people, I have to rely on, because in doubt they will save your life or put this for you.
However, even if it sounds weird for the first time, my experience sounds like a conservative attitude, it is proud of Germany, and it is more proud of the left-hand policy, even if this policy is supposed to be used for them or if it feels they need to do it right, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, as police and forces of course are also a cross section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly smear any state-threatening plans is medial completely exaggerated and angry me too.
Of course, police and soldiers who were often abroad are often commenced to pause because of negative experiences and also say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It is also possible that right mindmates also meet who have a real exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, my opinion is well combated, and it is also counteracted with political education and education.
Germany is so twisted internationally and that is so good in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have right racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yeah, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't out of sale.
I ordered it in November.
it has been confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order that's no longer available.
I've cheated with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could supply the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this basket is also available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top of the wood's edge are two deep candles, filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Orderer by child?
Hello, I've been working a thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (in self-employed, very little leisure), but already my lifetime I get it more bad than just to keep my household clean and decent.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and clean.
But it's never really that "someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband isn't better either, but I don't think it's going to disturb me somewhere, but most of it simply loses households against work and distress.
The kitchen is always cleaned because we like to cook.
Now on my question, have you managed to become more decent with child?
We haven't done anything yet, but we've been working on it and this question has been working on me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't disturb me so stupid as long as no visit comes and, for example, is always fresh clothing there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger stimulus with a child or are you slippery?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality and anatomic pre-formed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and allows virtually unlimited freedom of movement.
Preformation with special, further exploration of the joints for improved freedom of movement (in arms and knees)
For Focea Comfort 4, the surface covered by the Flex system was more than doubled in the Flex System 2 to further increase the comfort.
Nearless stretch panels on the joints reduce the friction (axis, arm and knees)
High-quality advances in the lower back area and in the step ensure an enclosed, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the linging spinal area increases flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves the comfort, especially in the ironing and mounting of the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone that is around the shoulders and on the back guarantees increased flexibility in movements of the arms and the back.
Fireskin is a warming, water resistant material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face on the hood increases the comfort, sealing and durability (separate head hood)
Smooth, in the crown area improves sealing with a fine-adjustable waist adjustment by a flexible, cleaning clothing lock which does not belong to the casing or seams
Double mancette with zipper to arm and foot joints combine a envelopable inner mancette with a soft, chopped neoprene outdoor mancette
45° incorporation at the closure of the inner mancette for increased elasticity and loadability in dressing.
Long zipper on the neck with an elaskin amplification, for an anatomic cut with increased comfort on the overall without hail

Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zipper to prevent zipping if excessive force is used.
Neopren panels bonded with external and internal overlap
Edges of the outer crafts for greater loadability
Edges of the interior handles pinned for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer at its place, especially in the case of deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as a person with self-insured personality disturbance?
I have been training in the field of software development and I have been learning since about a year.
Sadly, however, I notice more and more that this job is not the right thing for me, so I have been considering for a long time, re-starting and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disturbance (EVPS).
That means that I have no feeling of self-evaluation and I am thus shy.
I have no problem talking to people at a real level, but it makes me feel very difficult to talk and I have been told more often that I’m working inaccurately (which I think I’ve already got better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or in an open youth step, but rather in such advice or family assistance.
I do not know, however, whether the specific working day is really the way I imagine it is, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it takes me down every time I have something to complain about my code ("should the simplest things behaved again") and I find it difficult to ask for more experienced colleagues to ask for help ("I should now really know how this is going"/"I hold him with my stupid questions from the work"/"der really needs to consider me to be disadvantaged" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every job, but I wanted to have mentioned it in the place.
But you've kept that sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pick-up
What do they mean, please give back!
If I have downloaded a book to #PRS_ORG#, the message will not be authorized by your #PRS_ORG#
Are there problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein absorbed with the feed (protein) breaks the bird into the individual protein compounds (amino acids) in its stomach-darm tractor and builds its body-own proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation of nestling and feather reformation of the mausering bird are extremely complex processes and associated with a particularly high demand for the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NECTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding because otherwise there can be brewing disorders.
Following this curative administration of NECTON-Bio should be reversed to daily vitamin supply with NECTON-S (Multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral substance preparation).

1 g NECTON bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft feed.
It is recommended to prepare as much drinking water/milk feed as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A stripped measuring spot (including) corresponds to 1 g NECTON bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or threefold dose of NECTON bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of feather reformation is visible.
The normal dose is then reached until the feather re formation is complete.
Storage: NECTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun radiation, between 15° and 25°C.
Please apologize, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months ?
The guarantee claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to tell you that my order has arrived damaged and images have been attached.
Have you received this e-mail?
Statement of a community employee in revoking the statute
Hello r/Journal AdviceGerman,
I have this problem.
On our property a walnut tree will be delighted.
So Fällan ordered to the municipality.
One employee writes me that the case of fruit trees and thus also the Walnuss is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the walnuts are explicitly indicated as a protective tree.
Can I rely on the staff's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a retirement or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that only the question is whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the ceiling to Germany
Can you check that?
Eil note: Severe traffic accident at Selb
Recently a serious traffic accident occurred at St 2179 between Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police's press alarm is currently reporting (14:03 o'clock), a car has come to counter traffic when he gets over.
There's injuries.
I understand.
Well, thank you again that it was so easy!
Council and ideas on further vocational life
For the first time, happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head just breaks down everything you can think of.
Before I get out of here now .. shortly: I need advice and best of people who somehow know my situation - that is, of you.
I'm just doing the Ref as a merger.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in an area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't call more precisely here).
But then I was too boring and I looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
Sometime I landed at the Teaching Office and I was sure that it is - even though the framework conditions are clearly inflexibler than in my previous profession, but I didn't care about that.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job invitations".
And it's only half a year around.
At the times before, I have always decided to continue and at least to finish the Ref, after that I can still swallow.
But just I'm totally finished.
I had so little free time last month that I've been completely exaggerated.
Now there are holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was my weekend also my weekend and my celebration evening.
That's where I was free.
And the stress on the work was inevitable at the moments.
Now the family celebration is too stressful for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that nervous me in addition.
Basically, it makes fun and from outside view, the Ref also works well as to feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exaggerated and wondering how much stress my body holds before he gets completely close - if he doesn't.
I wonder if I would like to have this the rest of the working life - just if I read some contributions from you here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, since where I was appreciated, I could take free time when I needed it, and although the work was somewhat boring, but was adequately paid for it and together in a team that worked and was not as a single fighter like that now is the most time of the case.
But then I wonder if I haven't arrived at the same place in one year as now and I'm not satisfied.
You realize it's all somewhat tricky, but maybe you've got out as outstanding advice or ideas, how I can get out of this situation, which I'm completely finished and that I start to cry in the smallest thought of it.
I'm not gonna make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thanks for reading and apologizing to the winery underton of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has developed steadily, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" scenery, which perfectly reflects the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the latest in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), based on the analysis of components and amps, the VTX amplifiers are waiting for with an authenticity, which is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube amplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this tailored circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflection system, from which the natural resonances are only so spraying.
With the "Tone Room" software of VOX, you can even correct and prohibit historical facts on the virtual level until the Amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined it.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to meet new sound requirements, which has led again to a power scooter of the VOX Valvetronix series – with more dynamics as well as more numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From handy VT20+ to VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for a maximum sound variety will be found here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuancated play dynamics and string attack as well as a prompt talk.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that the final stage mainly determines the character of a amplifier and developed VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The Valve Reactor-scending of each VT+ amplifier fitted with a 12AX7 tube perfectly represents the behavior, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Loss Magic at Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz, Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main issue is also adaptable: with three individual placement and folding clothing participants, it is according to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for every type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror cameras.
Finally, what fits in the backpack depends of course on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with a positioned lens, two to three alternate lenses and a mount flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
You can also steal a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras of Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Serie) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photo-friend things.
Drone pilots also meet an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulcan breakthrough on La Palma: probably longest history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava streams on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcano outbreak on La Palma has been the longest in the famous history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the outbreak of the volcano Tehuya was considered to be the longest on the Atlantic island on the west coast of Africa in 1585.
No reliable data are available about previous eruptions.
The activity of the unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past days, but volcanoologists have continued to dare no forecast when he could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best message is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV channel RTVE.
Injuries in millions
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 housings and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Knapp 1200 hectares were covered by a metre thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, Lava produced two new landings with a size of about 50 hectares.
In particular, the major banana cultivation for the island was severely affected, of which about half of the about 85,000 people live directly or indirectly, and which was already in the crisis before the volcano outbreak.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is in front of the door, and especially the children will hardly expect the celebration of heaven.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the crushing tension in themselves.
Christmas is one of the few traditional events that still hold together our increasingly divided society.
The more important thing is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift, so that the gesture of the gift, which, according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, has been a peace-founding "social treaty of natural populations", can escape the steady routine and be refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How the Christian Child became from Nikolaus
Strictly, it was the Protestants by which Christmas days were closely linked to gifts.
Previously on the Nikolaus Day, gifts were given to some kind.
The background of this still popular morality is that the Holy Nikolaus as Bishop of Myra had secretly thrown three women into their window in one night to save them another life in sin.
This unconventional kind of gift came from the popular custom in Germany to fill the boots, especially the children, with gifts.
Protestants stumbled on this custom because they reject intermitters between God and humans as "healthy worship".
For these reasons, they shall keep themselves from the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child from Nikolaus and founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift was on the sacred evening.
However, since most Protestants do not see such detail issues so closely, it is only the least annoyed that the custom of Saint Nikolaus is similar to Martin's use with Martinssingen and Martin's conversion is still a solid part of the pre-declaration period.
Today you will find in boots before the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to desired luxury watches all that the heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources have proved a tradition of gift since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nikolaus.
With the reformation, the day of the gift traveled on the Holy evening.
However, in all Christian countries, a cheerful cheerful mood is presenting the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christian child appears on the Holy evening or the Christmas man, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, whom some own species were assigned with the time.
This includes, for example, his white bart, which has little common with the rather strict assyrbart of the historical figure, his sleeve drawn by pensioners and the favor of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nikolaus remains the central figure at the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy there is the witch Befana, who should have given them the way to the Son of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fabulous creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought fathers' little frost to some glory.
Here it is not pensioners, but three horses that draw their sledges as troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for giving the gifts.

Police shoots suspicious bank robbers near the King's Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told the callers that they had reported a man who should have gone to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookmaker.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
It had fallen shots and the man had been hit.
He was declared dead in the town of deceased.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other royal family members also live there.
Which one?
No matter where I click, I'll be directed to your side immediately.

In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from remote galaxies that lend interior color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light is fascinating – optionally in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The cantless, amorphic design is consciously chosen: as a naturally shaped large pestilence, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic rounds fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone beet.
He also makes himself well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and finders, where he knows himself thanks to his size.
You can save great work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require any transmission or batteries.
Set the "light stone" to any day of sun shining place.
Two strained spikes provide fixed hold when needed.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weather resistant.
His solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already loading when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the event of intrusion, "Smart Stone" begins to illuminate itself; in which color you define it yourself: The same six attractive light colors are you – besides daylight white – for choice.
Finally, the disabling is automatically done when the battery load level has dropped to a specified minimum or it gets bright again.
Once the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins from the front the next day.
That's what I've done several times. It doesn't work.

The engine control of the LokSound 5 was re-founded fundamentally.
A variable adjustable PWM tact frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz provides a super-slip operation with bell anchor engines – the typical "breams" belongs to the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases by up to 10 CVs.
The unique autotune function allows automatic measurement of the decoder to the engine.
The LokSound 5 Decoder also provides enough juice for older engines with up to 1.5A engine current.

Pillen Problem
Hello Dear Female,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill about five years ago again, mostly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shake PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to leave this again because I have to take enough medicines because of chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had received from 0 to 100 explosion-like pickel at my last about two years of break and this everywhere.
As far as superficial, but I was very stressed, and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe anyone has any tips to avoid this once.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, women's doctor hasn't taken me so seriously and skin doctor's appointment is coming.
Thanks to everyone who has read through the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Prebupertary had bad Neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-flake squirrels and the acne theme.
I have also tried to feed all possible in the course of disease and have stayed on no sugar, milk and meat-poor mixing food because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It may also be good that hormonell is simply the worm in it, but if you have a construction site like me everywhere, you would prefer to stop looking for what else is going wrong.
I had all of her colleague semina o. a.
Written and now I lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concern.
I have to work in the meantime and to the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
what's there to check if the money was there, I'd have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
But there is him in general in great

110 kV earth cable is rebuilt 2022
The approval for the transfer of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legally powerful.
The plan fixing decision of the government of Niederbayern frees the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This now informed the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometres long earth cable will combine the Tann circulation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt direction between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of the release line.

All three other packages have arrived so that a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further process is now?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget that, I've explained that several times yesterday!

Ref: Planning lessons (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in Ref since summer, teaching has been fun, but I have currently have big problems to plan time-efficient my teaching in Earth science.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped so that I can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium in principle.
In school, I can only copy s/w free of charge (which is nervt for exploration).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the theme of geo factors and with me, actually, every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs etc.).
When planning, I'm always going out of the goal of learning (what I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
This is why the worksheets are also available.
Maybe I can get a pedestrian as you can work time-efficiently with the book.
I'd be glad.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I really decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to take the return as soon as possible for the first time.
The trade fears Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most shops only who is vaccinated or healed.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about turnover breaks.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations, from the viewpoint of the German Trade Association (HDE), corrupt the retail trade the important Christmas business.
In the case of transactions with articles of non-day needs, turnover breaks should be complained, HDE chief business leader Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a current HDE survey of 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already deprecated the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive highlight of the year is often a hole without the ground," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost one third of their pre-crises in the past week.
Well it runs only in food retail and in the online field.
The association demanded consequences from dramatic development.
Purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the main business leader.
"2G during shopping does not continue us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations scared customers and required high personnel utilization.
It requested that the volume scheme be approved throughout the country.
After that, each customer had to be controlled only once on 2G (vaccinated or healed) and would have access to all businesses with the retained volumes on that day.
In addition, sample controls should be sufficient in retail trade - as already in public transport in the case of the 3G rules (vaccinated, healed or tested).
The German Euroshop, specialized in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Frequencies were last without 2G at approximately 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said head of director Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economy Week".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the center is being tried to find and get solutions approved.
This includes the so-called volume solution, where "for example, visitors can once enter all shops at a central location in the center and then – equipped with a bracelet similar to that in a club hotel – uninterruptedly".
I have recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried to be cheated with a yellow filler.
That looks stupid.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it into the package and sticked it back.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
For setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor provides exceptional possibilities.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light produces a very light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flash-free.
The 120 degree radiation angle with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can customize the brightness practically without changing the colour temperature.
It is a great tool to work both at the film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows the remote control of the lamp in TV studios or when the lamp is mounted in difficultly accessible places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of keys and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery range)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply pressing and finishing one of the storage keys.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that when new switching on, the known situation is restored - very practical in studio work if the camera is set to certain color temperatures, for example.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can access existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester that is built in with it - for each of the two batteries a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlamp over the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very easy.
You have a 16mm hook as a connection for mounting, so you can directly contact your phototative.
The inclination shall be reliably adjusted by means of fixers on both sides.
It has been taken into account that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a benevolent is included in the scope of delivery.
Great is that a bag is also included in the delivery range.
So you can safely transport or store the light with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Sadly, I've been given and she's too small :(
"Party we wanted to flavor": Frankfurt celebrates after a great comeback against liver kissing
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga pledge.
But then the SGE turned up, in a good hour the frustration shook about a growing season start of the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It is madness what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner exclaimed at DAZN and spoke a "Pauschal-Lob, to everyone who was involved".
At first, it looked after a new steamer for the Frankfurter who was now on rank nine still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the liver cushioner with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players returned then and showed a fantastic performance," says Glasner further.
I am madly happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Also Christopher Lenz, who was able to reappear since the fourth day of the game and his overwhelming muscle injury, stressed the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to mess today.
But for the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself now, but is also well established with regard to the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now you want to "go step by step and remain modest" and to "do the tasks at this level" until the change of the year.
Next, on Wednesday in the course of the English week, a play out at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky) is on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you because of my mistakes.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent to me again directly or must I wait until the money has been transferred back and give up the order again?
Sadly, I would say that I will not be ordered again because it has lasted for a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for handball women before quarter finals against Spain
Germany's handball women slept after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views from the parquet.
The DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers, at the end of the WM head-drunk, was a defeat and has to run against host Spain in the quarter final.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," judged Federal Trainer Henk Groener.
We must be different from Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany concluded the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danishs (10:0).
It's a pity that we couldn't take the Flow.
This was a bad game we have to delete from all," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semi-finale against the World Cup-Threads of 2019 on Tuesday, a significant increase must be made in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German advertising in the Duell with the three-time Olympician Denmark was backspace player Alina Groeels with six gates.
"We weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," admitted backspace player Xenia Smits and asked: "We have to look forward quickly."
Not at height from front to rear
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the appetite was not at the height.
Flaws and technical errors in the attack and defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 backstand after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some paradens.
The first gate succeeded the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grayeels successfully completed a quick counterpart.
However, the expected initial inflammation was not.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danishs, the German women could hardly sit in scenes - and if they were, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandina Quarters.
So the game was running early at 3:10, after 20 minutes, since backspace player Mia Zschocke saw a little later red because of a hard foul on her counterplayer.
But in the quarter final, she can rejoin.
Only during the final phase of the first mid-term, the DHB selection was a bit better at the game and at least at five gates until the break.
The only quiet hope of a retirement after the change was already after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener-Schütze sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-founded opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer abolish a performance increase and went as a clear loser from the parquet.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in Christmas

Is this with them?
The title is available, I am a vaccine doctor in mobile vaccine teams, where the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is (to date only) vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon too much finished, partly in vaccine centres will continue for me.
I like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are personally related to a person (e.g. "I take medication X, this complies with vaccination.).
In my task area, the information for vaccination, the indication position (person has the right to vaccination according to Coronimpfvereinigung and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in allergic reactions (not yet happens).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, such as medical professionals.
In vaccine teams, however, we often do not have "only" (for God’s sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, which can't do any vaccination (should?), so that I can also carry out most of the vaccinations themselves.
Difficult "Huider" question: Amberger knows the solution
What, please, is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an amberger, the BR TV broadcast "We in Bavaria" has been provided for intense thoughts.
But unlike many preceding days, the term in the series "Host my?" remained unerrated this time by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "human who's nervous."
And no one, "that everything has to go fast."
That, people heard from the TV engineer, it's totally wrong.
On which the man from Amberg told the solution and thereby probably gave rise to astonishment in many upper males.
"The chamber," the spectators learned, "is a lape with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewing the Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical superficial term, derived somehow from the rather known word "parents".
With which a gambling of education was closed - probably also with some who have long lived in the Amberg area.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always comes: opens - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have started the #PRS_ORG#gel#PRS_ORG#n, rebooted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
tyre choice at the racing wheel- really so pann safe?
Today tomorrow I wake up full of deeds because I wanted to train at least a little in the next week to prepare my bike tour.
Said, done, and I was riding with my racing wheel, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what happened in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) was lauded.
Glass splitters on the route.
Zack, loud cishes and my rear tyre didn't want to join the rest of the route at all.
Because I had no real possibility of getting me a replacement robe and spare hose, I had to turn back with half a bad mood and take the first train home.
Then, too, launtechnically wasn't so bad, maybe it's better if I practice it again in the tyre change before the bike tour.
But now I stand before a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days before me, I would get extremely unhappy of this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since the old tyres of the pre-owner (very nice old man, the day I picked up the bike has been cut off up to 120km!) and who had already described it as a suboptimal because he had been rolling with them for more years.
But if I think I have to make another tyre change when I drive to 80-90kms, then I think I really am badly lazy :D
Now I came into the conversation with an older man at the highway, who wondered why I wouldn't have the marathon Plus tyres; they should be unplatable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very appealing.
But are they really so incapable?
I don't want to spend 40€/ripe now, just to be disappointed.
I also ask myself: I've got at the moment on the racing wheel I believe 25x622.
They are also (likely?) at the Marathon Plus tyres, but most of them are already broader.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on a racing bike generally to other tyres?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Laie know-how rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car slides against tree: riders fatally hurt
On the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, the 53-year-old was prized with his car from unclear cause against a central island and then moved to the counterway, as the police reported.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then swept against a tree and the man included in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old rider were severely injured in the accident and brought to nearby hospitals.

After the publication of our new High End B 100-6 OHM Breitbands, it was only a question of time until our SOLO series would again grow.
SOLO 15 is called the new vocal and visually reminds of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this proposal, a suitable designed foot is directly included in order to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in the length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in which the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role but is to be achieved an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered sound pressure levels.
But that does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerably grown and is extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
The SOLO 15 was voted with a slight high ton increase.
This is generally common for broadbands to optimize the too high frequencies of strongly increasing bundling.
Exactly focused on the hearing area, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly rotated outwards can reduce the high-tone range and thus the sound image can be warmer designed.
Thanks to the point sound source, the placement of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is tight and surprisingly precise.
The reference suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure an enemy dynamic that is looking for his same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but extends it in terms of resolution power and accuracy.
As with all our sets, it is recommended at the beginning to make thoughts about the final optics of the speaker in order to plan appropriate changes in the construction process.
For example, if you want to furnish the housing, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the furnace reloads material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first bow an 8 mm hole into the ground plate at the appropriate place to be able to perform the cable without any problems there.
With the help of a upper froze, the speaker opens in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
This opening should be fitted back with a 45° fibre in order to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100-6 OHM are interrupted in the fibre, as shown in the image 'Detail Fibre'.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface.
Now on these, the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are eliminated.
The three distortions should also be used and adhesive.
The sealings themselves may vary in the strength of material if necessary, for example, if you want to take back on finished powers from the construction market instead of making them themselves from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step of work, the second side is added.
Afterwards all the plates of the foot follow, so both sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a wooden driller, the opening of the bass reflex tube as well as the connecting clamp on the back wall will be facilitated.
Then you use a circular miller to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the floor can also be rounded off.
Afterwards, the footplate is sticked firmly with the foot of the chamber and also screwed with long wood screws.
It follows the signing and prebohren (2.5-mm drilling) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connector clamp.
After the housing of wood dust has been cleaned (sucking/blowing), you start putting the cable.
The easiest success is through the 35 mm bass reflection opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncircumcised cable piece for piece through the 8 mm bore into the foot to the terminal opening and makes it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the chamber, the cable is guided to the loudspeaker opening, and it also makes it loose out there.
The following are prepared and used the frequency fluids.
The construction plan of the frequency fluids, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be retrieved from the following document: assembly instructions soft Solo 15.
If the frequency flux is built in and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening within the box, which is not completely locked.
Due to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot sticks on the opening and so lock them.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the contamination follows according to description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be resolved at the loudspeaker's pluspole (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
To prevent, a matt of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be freed.
Can I give up a order now and leave it to be delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that we will again organise the OSCAST this year!
> For well-known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people by switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will go about 0.30.
Make drinks cold, plan good food and prepare for a long but very interesting night.
