Plans for strengthening nuclear cooperation are on the top of the agenda.
According to reports India also hopes for a treaty for defence cooperation between the two nations.
Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after faster motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Transport police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they watched it as it left a tank station on the Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and went on the Burgess Road before he turned down to the bush country, where the officials lost it out of sight.
The motorcycle as well as a person complied with the description of the driver was later seen at a house at Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accused a 20-year-old man of not respecting a stop signal as well as unrespectable driving.
He was to appear on 23 September before the Court of Appeal in Karratha.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "consciously sleeping, and couldn't signal any consent."
Webster is also suggested to have raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish highland on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiation date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reconciliation to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congress members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil law.
"As trade unions die, the middle class jobs also die," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and Deputy Chairman of Progressive Caucus at the Congress.
That is why I proudly introduce the Empowerment Act, together with John Lewis, the Citizens' Rights.
This breaching law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops such anti-employed forces.
The addition of the national labour law law in order to create a possibility of discrimination from workers to organise a trade union representative in order to complain before a civil court for justice - and to obtain damages or penalties - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the further sponsors of their law template suggest is the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the relapse of trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and maintain labour rights.
There was a time to remember millions of Americans when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full consciousness that workers and their trade unions played a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers are guaranteed to unification and joint negotiation and actions".
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight urged David Eisenhower and his staff to write the Germans to a constitution that would ensure that Fascism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the need for workers to organise themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause explicitly saying: "The right to establish associations to secure the working and economic conditions and to improve each individual and every profession or business is guaranteed.
Agreements restricting or aiming to degrade this right are zero and void, and measures which are not legally envisaged.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chaired by the International Human Rights Commission, which designed the General Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors included a warranty that "everone has the right to form trade unions to protect his interests or to join them."
Since generations, Americans have accepted the basic premises that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union should then be protected in collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with companies and government bodies.
After these rights have been shot in America, it is indeed very wise to re-established the American ideal, that is why the working population must have the right to unite and hear themselves in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation but increased it.
By increasing the standard of life of millions of people, work has created a wonderful market for industry and has raised the entire nation to unimaginable production levels.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers - has long been overwhelming.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and have triggered the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force to close
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge for the first time stopped implementing a law in Louisiana, from which lawyers say that it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the State.
This measure, which was imposed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and to enter into force on 1 Sept., would force doctors performing abortion to acquire a patient's right to take a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
The judge's decision, however, means that doctors may be able to continue legal abortion while applying such a law.
"The plaintiffs can continue the legal basis, while they are trying to obtain these rights," wrote Bundesrichter John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing for the judge will be made in order to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the youngest in a number of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors have made more time to obtain hospital instruction rights.
"The decision today means that the women in Louisiana are out of a deterrent law that wants them to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the State to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also covered the doctors from the two clinics which had not joined the appeal and had also requested instruction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, where courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for non-constitutional purposes.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics left in the state to terminate, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
The American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that instruction rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion opposers shall prevent the measures from protecting women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient instruction rights, informed the Center for Reproduction Rights.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop abortion, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery for fear of its safety, said the group.
In their arguments against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the execution of abortions while their requests for patient instructions would still be adhered.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment possibilities leads to higher death rates by egg stock cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put an online video home for her mother who died in 2007 of eggstock cancer.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarium cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women in which eggstock cancer was found in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
CLEIN STUDY: New medicines could slow lungs and eggstock cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman also influenced the chances of survival in the diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing diseases and social and economic status.
For older women and those whose cancer had been further advanced for the diagnosis period, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of eggstock cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for it.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and most of them can be found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services in order to oppose distances, she suggested, as a possible remedy, strengthening the service of inflated doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer at their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovary cancer, regardless of geographic status, and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published in the Medical Journal of Australia today.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years of age from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of eggstock cancer.
Garden centres regret decreasing house owner numbers
The decrease in the number of house owners under the age of 35 could result in a loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year when today's young consumers reach the "kern age group for garden products" according to a HTA study, as reported in Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with their own home spend for their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting pregnancy for parking purposes and the decline in garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated £ 5 billion are sold annually.
In London, over a period of 6 years, the proportion of home owners fell from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot move plants.
Guy Barter, head garden consultant for the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade due to rising house ownership numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also predicted a improved market situation for this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergyman Tahirul Qadri continues in Pakistan.
In the capital Islamabad, some 1,000 demonstrators have crashed the PTV State TV station.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station launched its operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends it again.
At the same time, some 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around one kilometer away, they supplied with sticks and stones equipped collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but this refuses.
The country's army is calling for a political solution to the conflict to "don't waste and apply without violence".
After a meeting at the main quarter on Sunday evening, the military informed: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent.
The opposition politician Imran Khan suggests Prime Minister Sharif to be deceived at the parliamentary election in May last year.
The protests were escalated during the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to penetrate to Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey is awarding U.S. diplomat for spying reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed the country's oldest US diplomats for information on a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Vice-President Bülent said that the businessman of the U.S. message and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former American analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a main activity area for US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all the important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report, which also had the most important secret service of Germany's Ankara in the visor, provided a much more annoying response from the Turkish government.
Warnstreik: Locator threatens with consequences for Pendler
The voluntary warning strike of the lodgers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The announced expedition for 18 to 21 o'clock covers all transport companies, including remote, regional and S-Bahn transport across the country;
The main impact of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the District Chairman of the German Locomotive Manager (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main impact of the warning strike is freight transport.
The German Railway in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to streak, so it is difficult to see the consequences specifically.
Police Chief of Magaluf of Corruption
On Friday, the accusers presented evidence of extortions by police officers and staff of the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca.
The head of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Binge-Drinking-Hotspot Magaluf.
Principal Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was investigated by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the road where most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of expressions by policemen and staff of the city of Calvià, on Friday, to the Office of the Prosecutor of Corruption.
Two other local policemen were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the accusations of corruption and were interviewed by a judge with Navarro.
The National Spanish newspaper ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners claimed that the vetternal economy of the authorities has a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about deserving money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Let our life base out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video in which a 18-year-old British tourist was shown, who went to 24 men during a sauftour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-drinked cruise tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipen Tour organizer Carnage together have to pay a penalty of €55,000 (73.000).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British vacationers, is also known for many accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "Balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has afforded a winter surprise from South Australia, with heavy swings and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening to 21 o'clock, another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen down in the night on Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a bush that started shortly before 20 o'clock and provided almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell back to a maximum of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The low weather conditions probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19.30 p.m. but was hit by a windwind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
Windshots reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start on a second land flight and finally set up at about 20.40 a.m.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including a Emirate flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible viewers.
Matthies says: Highest time for big networking
Given the gallopping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech scalt centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting with an extremely familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this here, my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a reasoning behind: if the cable wasn't, in the shortest time, all listeners would flee around the house, and that would be even more significant retro.
In any case, the eceltronic (ekeltronic) is true.
No, hint error: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow is purchased - obsolete.
And, for example, whoever still has a tube TV in the living room today, he simply says that he refuses television in principle.
Why are these considerations?
Because the Ifa's indication at the radio tower this week again leads us to our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The Laie, who used to blindly dominate washing machine and CD players today, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are distributed with incomprehensible eglem expert speech before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, you all right?
What should you talk about with people who seem to spread such a quarter voluntarily?
Actually, for about 20 years it has been most important that we should like to connect our house.
In order for the Joghurt to re-order himself so that the fire detector will tell us on the Maldives that it is just burning in the working room.
And it wouldn't be wonderful if we were from the office air conditioning on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true in the near future: We lift our watch, tell her loudly "Saugen!" - and the vacuum augrobot goes away at home.
I'm wrong.
Everything goes on to nothing less than a revolution: "The limits between white and brown goods are silent," a industry expert raids, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamgarer sends the weather report and the data brilliant shows how long the pizza still needs in the oven, but nothing is useful because we stand in the stew.
We also know from the daily practice: When a new-modern device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the territories near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air protection rooms, while rockets and mortar shoots came to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools stayed in Gaza, while the area recovered from the fights.
The start of the school brought a feeling of joy and expectation to the municipalities drawn by rocket shock holes in the south of Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" children's garden, which was met by a rocket, were found before the pupils meet granates from the walls and sliding walls.
"We are a little afraid, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in the Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children from our area need the return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a little funny" to go back to school suddenly.
"That were difficult times, and we didn't get out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities, such as Saad, remained in their homes or left their houses to move further away from Gaza to escape the rocket and murder fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border of Gaza, where a four - year - old boy was killed by a Palestinian monastery grain, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education informed that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town of Gaza, which is severely characterized by the Palestinian army.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you will acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an unlimited ceasement of weapons.
The rest of the weapons ensured an immediate end of the fights; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ demand for abolishing the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for a devotion of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect discussions is expected to start this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2.100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
However, Israel disagrees with these information and estimates that at least half of the victims are fighters, did not present any concrete evidence for this information.
On Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai workers, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4.491 rockets and monastery grains during the battles on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into provisional protection areas.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective areas and continue fighting, the educational authorities moved the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be opened again soon so that we can continue to learn as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After choice in Saxony: CDU-Vise Strobl questions NPD ban procedures
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has expressed itself for the end of the current NPD banning process before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the current prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU Head of Land in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a delightful development in the right direction and development, which makes me more of the result that we are fighting the NPD politically and not the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had failed very close to the five percent hurdle at the vote on Sunday.
A first start for a ban on the legal extreem party was failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection at that time also had intelligence at the NPD level.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Bundesrat filed a new request in Karlsruhe.
Federal government and Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
In the new country, refugees are now being housed in tents.
The first central recording for refugees in Harburg is out of all seams.
Now the interior authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross.
The district politicians were briefly informed - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to raise reservations for citizens and give the district politicians no way to contribute constructively to the human accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, President of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party calls for the Harburg District Administration to provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overfill in the first recording are the attack of seekers - and the circumstance that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Owners in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not equally distributed across the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, told Sydney and Melbourne to promote a two-part market.
The figures of RP Data prove that the house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, on the other hand by 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which was hardly affected by the cuts in government expenditure and where prices over the year only increased by 1.4 percent.
Mr Lawless continued to say that at the spring start, a rise would be observed in the real estate for the next months that would undergo the market "a real test".
"When one considers the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the persistent low interest environment, it is likely that the home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts statements from Managing Director Peer Medau and asserts this to pose "like a field master".
The style of the university is not this, says the communication.
Thus, the Medau family had already been informed in the middle of June of a month about the adventure of the university.
The statement that the plans were known only in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans are not "preparations or even decisions", but it would be "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle needed for access is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
A nine meters wide road was and is not mentioned.
It goes to current position around 5.50 meters, which is a metre broader than before," explains Pötzl.
The Medau operator's argument that their free and educated parking spaces will only be used by university students in the future, does not want to let Pötzl apply.
Zugeparkt is not at all because it is now intelligently resolved, as in other public parking areas.
Think of the residents
According to the university president, the children's crab of mountain weights, which would lead the access to the park deck before their door, would not be affected.
Rather, he has to consider, "that this is not only about the children's crises, but also about the residents at the mouthing of the Friedrich-Streib street and the 800 students of the neighboring real school.
So it's much more than the particular interests of Mr Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent council of the children's crab, with the expansion of the road would be entitled "the few naturally left spots of Coburg" to "may decide the reader himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, wants to inform the city councils about the development of the university by 2020 and in this context address the importance of the new adoption.
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's crab last week about the plans of the university.
Accordingly, the access to the new park deck is intended not to take over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib street, but to the Medau-Berg.
So the narrow road would have to be built on about a mile of length two-pure.
According to the Medaus's records, traffic in the park of Hohenfels would become tenfold.
About 2000 vehicles per day are mentioned.
From the sides of the city, one did not want to comment on the project until now.
Glandorf returns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to health problems in particular for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it was mature for several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the 2007 world champion informed on his Facebook page.
It is therefore going to be a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 gates for Germany to retire in international retirement.
Because the whispered backspace player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on the gate hunt for a few years, he is no longer available to the new federal trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelandic, who announced his framework for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf led a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have been as thrilled to me as they will also be enthusiastic about my long-standing fellow players and my followers.
But I would like to be healthy for my club in the next years, for this, longer regeneration breaks are necessary that do not allow the current double load.
The left-handed man had to fear even his career end in 2012 after a fersen infection.
Due to the problems of agillion, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Association (DHB) with a cortison syringe that later caused a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers do not pass to any body spurlessly.
I have some health buildings that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot surgery that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure properly.
Some other wear-related complaints come to this.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that I can't deceive my head, but my body," explained Glandorf in the interview the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be ready for a comeback in absolute emergency.
"When all the stricks are stricken, I'm always ready to talk," said the two-fold family father to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years I can still play handball.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble as regards my health.
After my career, I want to go at least somehow.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he took the EHF pokal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and in 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the Pokalsieger's Europe pokal with Flensburg.
German economy shrinked by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have braked the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the pre-quartal.
This informed the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
In the spring, only consumers lived in the economy, while investments decreased.
The external trade also braked the economy.
Due to the strong annual upturn, a total GDP rate of 0.8 percent is due for the first half of the year compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through Burgmann's city on Sunday for the first time.
The Burgmann city of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "fitzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It covers the largest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne with their registration for the organization of this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered by interested people in various specialist journals.
We come from Den Helder and have traveled overnight to take part in this tour.
We want to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists welcomed the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration in the association home of the Schützenbrüderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace of peace" through the city over the wall, where the start also took place.
Further, the route, which was issued for three different categories, led to Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Bilderbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 altitude metres, 120 kilometres with 1475 altitude metres and 145 kilometres with 1775 altitude meters, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were nursed on the way in Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor representative Heinz Lölfing showed great pleasure in the success of these cycling events.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all stakeholders.
The organization left without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, what was probably the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We see again in 2015 at hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," however, the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
Constantine Weckers unequivocally honest memories
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, Songmaker, Pazifist, Political Activist, Ex-Happling, in "Mönch and Warriors" has brought to paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought fetches for thought fetishes, the Munich born on June 1, 1947 wrote his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text.
And he is honest with it: From the onanie as a gymnasiast to the store stealing and drug use, he does not leave any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also takes abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in now, spirituality - all that he tries to go on the ground, in very philosophical, but also very personal.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he has influenced not only the music (the opera lover became a Soul and Rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Constantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, which is "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary".
However, there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the high - spirited views: for example, over battles in a locally frequented by GIs or a whistle car ride, where he ancillated a tree frontal.
There he's honest too.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Didn't say "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tried for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
They never saw his face, only listened to his voice: "Hear up with the crack.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown when I was a child - went to the kneipe with him and talked about things like the form of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner that the newspaper read.
Henry recently opened a shooting in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep rising labyrinthe with flames and smoke and plenty of smoke.
My father used to just put himself in the tub, and then he was slow to hear how he started singing because he was able to wash the casting of himself.
When I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' witnesses of love.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was bad at the end of her life, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with that "I love you"?
Stop embraceing me!
Daddy, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still friends with French with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetes.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I pulled through this fitness thing and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's hard.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short-cut bart.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been joined by the theatre.
It followed the comedie of errors, and then fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and comedians who have filled out his working life.
He began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black Imitator/Comedian on television for a quite long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow up not only to the public, but also to learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people were "black painting," Henry launched his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish it would never have happened, but I don't regret that I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "for years award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "great parody of black people."
By introducing figures that mocked both the British black culture and celebrated, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first row of the Lenny Henry show went on the show in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as the kitchen chief Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series chef!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film rolls splendid his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels like you just bring the time around or take a little place."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was really allergic.
I never had learned something about him in school and thought him mostly for a domain of middle class, white in strump trousers and a cabbage head in front of it.
So I was very afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it once.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words into your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I felt that I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right up.
"That's why it's a serious thing, take them seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry felt instinctive that he had to talk to the audience.
"A little voice told me, "You have to cross over 10 minutes while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went off the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the sewings.
This also came well, so it's like a great sign of the gods who tell me "This is your purpose."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERNDE voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really love this.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has passed through humorous outbreaks while he always imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction is somewhat dangerous from a room full of strangers.
If you're always looking for this, you're going to drive it in front of a wall.
Sometimes I live in Apollo if I like it, but I don't get as much as I did before.
I'll ask him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a start, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up that again.
So is this his new incarnation here?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
One always tells a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between the Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemenite government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi adherents had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
The accession to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemenic media reports about a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called on the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi was threatened by a further escalation of the conflict, according to the sheet's information, not to fulfil its demands.
The Shitian Huthis fights for more independence from the sunnitic ruled Yemen and demands the resignation of the government.
For almost two weeks, the genus of the Huthi has defeated the Yemenite capital.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access routes of Sanaa.
In the countryside, bloody fights come again and again with the Yemenite army.
Kenya registered officials in order to control "Geisterarbeiter"
Kenya has started registering all government officials biometrically in order to remove "Geisterarbeiter" from the salary lists of the government.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government communication.
The government assumes that thousands of people receive salary payments even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service at his arrival in 2013.
At a test at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700,000 pounds) per month were lost in payments for "gester employed" and other misused financial practices.
The government assumes that salaries continue to be paid to accounts after a person died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are included, was notified in a government message.
All who would not do this without a credible apology were deleted from the salary list, the communication continued.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also adjusting the salary list on both government levels - so the "ghost staff" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal around the Art Advisor Helge Achenbach is first negotiated in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, demand 19.4 million Euro damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil process at the Düsseldorf Landgericht.
That told a courtspeaker on Monday.
The application says that Achenbach deceived during the purchase of artworks and oldtimers and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher purchase prices than actually paid.
This would also make the agreed commission higher.
Achenbach purchased value items for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years in school, 23 of which was head of school.
From this time Manfred Judge knows many renowned Petershausen and Collbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worn by his striving to see the people in the student.
The snowheads are the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
He was already interested in the teacher's career after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were degraded.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946, in the freight cargo.
Judge made it to the Upper Franconian Stinkdorf.
Teacher education took place in Bamberg.
Manfred judge had to run ten kilometres to the next train station six times a week, drive the train to Bamberg, crossing three kilometres across the whole city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred judge got a sleeping place in a red-cream home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 schoolmates in a sleeping room.
In 1951, he made the first and three years of teaching office attorneys the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken had no free teacher office for him, he purchased to Oberbayern and came to school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "service" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved to a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Judge 1980 after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and in Petershausen five.
From the school year 1968/69, these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association was founded in Indersdorf, only the primary school remained in the place.
In order to escape a retirement in the now smaller school, the then Rector Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Judge became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, so the children and their teachers were able to obtain today's building, which was extended after Judge's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Judge commends the uncomplicated generosity of Ludwig Götz, the former mayor, who, at municipal costs, had additionally built a workshop and during the expansion of 1997 cellar rooms, although it was not eligible for school buildings.
"Burgermeister Götz was very school-friendly," judge remembered.
During his career, Manfred Judge never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a section of a school council on justice and justice: "You should never forget love." Manfred Judge changed what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two ways: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "This doesn't always work." Whether he thinks only his pupils or just his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's doing was sometimes unconventional.
When students pleaded, they did not get some punishment from him, nor were they persecuted.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had made two pairs of box gloves and let the two counterparts attack each other, even if there should be a veil.
For the benefit of the school, judges as a Rector served a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
It moved the partyless Judge after his retirement to candidate at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
But Judge was chosen on place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicycle riders in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scotland intermediate stops
When cyclists take their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of russtenden was impressed: The 700 participants of the hr4-cycling tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Radles and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and experienced a concert of Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometres across Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen the athletes were welcomed by mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started with the bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the director of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of good things have been prepared: The landwives from Ranstadt and Lower Mock City had 85 sheets of apples, dishwashers, scatters and cheese cubits baked wonderfully to the decent cyclists.
"Solche cakes can only bake landwives," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while he ordered another piece.
At the drinking level of the Geiß-Nidda tournament, cold refreshments could be experienced.
The "Duo Bravo" interviewed visitors with well-known melodies from operets and musicals and enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful environment of the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also met a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, finally he has rebounded bicycle chains already jumped down today."
The mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the Drinkkurhaus by Reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also, since the first hr4-cycling tour in 2004, doctoral chief Tobias Hagen was able to snatch only briefly, but he had plenty of dealing with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated, wrote Facebook entries and made reports with his employees and the 15-head motorcycle staff of the police, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region," he said, "but also from casting or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus, and even from many cities in the Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants is a bit according to the available overnight capacity.
In Category I, participants are accommodated in Hotels, in Category II in Collections.
From the resort, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up again after one and a half hours: "Send!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they sneaked.
After the arrival in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the government of the Schottener Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festival and, of course, they had prepared delicious eggs, e.g. flame cakes with well-cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as CEO of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed visitors.
The three were clearly pleased with the "many operation in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity for a vibrant movement under free sky was diligently used in spite of the sports activity on the bike.
Among the guests were increasingly mixing citizens who had been involved with the good mood as well as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb, including a concert with the Trenkwaldern, were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes returned to Bad Vilbel.
Thousands of Turkish police for "conspiracy" arrested against the government
A total of 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of the "conspiracy against the government", local media agencies report.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrests are 14 high-ranking policemen, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the investigations of corruption against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they were supposed to have established an organized criminal association and picked up phone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (the then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities which the Islamist priest Fethulla Güllen has directed against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he informed waiting journalists that not all schools had been opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful sky.
All Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian peoplesfront must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slavic, who visited Jazenjuks daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that the children will receive a education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing chicken shirts, holding balloons in the hands and giving their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud lace from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with Bain and Co., the global management consultancy company, which she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearsons' media world.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearson's parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Their inventory was said to be nearly £1 million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant of the cabinet.
Your husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May, I described the Chairman's task with a poisoned cup.
Not only stands the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: after inwards on the first garde of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also on the outside as a voice of public concern and distress when things are running wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol that requires a comprehensive reform.
But which newly coming president would risk joining on everything and intervening an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might kill himself.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wouldn't be enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC minimized - power, money, and status overcrowded.
While competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, comfortable security, the next negotiation of license fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest amount of £ 145.50 per year, the British public is buying into the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: she says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pences per day.
And it seems that the BBC rises up again at the popularity scale: 53 percent today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The look and use habits for the BBC have changed: I get news series on my phone today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that decreasing Tweet was not authorized
A twoth of the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a declining remark on the democratic prosecutor of the state, who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of power.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another by Perry's user account, which abstracts the previous one.
Just a twot has been sent from my account, which wasn't authorized by me.
"I don't approve the Tweet and have deleted it," said the later message.
Perry's staff did not respond immediately to requests by comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually operated the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unprofitable picture was drawn by the prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to tax for drunkness in April 2013.
Perry put a Veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to resign, which led to an accusation against Perry - which might be presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweet is: "I don't always drive drunk with the three times permitted alcohol level ... but when I do it, I complain governor Perry when he puffs it out."
I'm the most drunken democratic in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry claims not guilty and called the accusation a political trick.
His high-class team of legal remedies requested that the judge in charge of the case reject the charge and argued that the law, which is committed against the most old-time governor in the history of the State of Texas, is inconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped 7.5 million dollars of government funds to the public integrity unit of the State - which is located in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This Veto provided a public complaint from a left-hand watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he completed the election meetings in Iowa during his presidential candidateship in 2012 as the fifth, Perry entered speculations that he would stop by posting a twoth of a photo of himself in the yoggen near a lake, saying, "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley again explains housing market for "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction companies pointed out that the apartment market in the southeast of England was "returned" to normal level.
Private homes in the capital were warmly desired and subject to enormous price increases, which, due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, the Bank of England moved to set ceilings for mortgage credits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the current financial year started, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the maximum level of 2013" and added that this offers a "stable environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the deviation, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Cataster Office's information, prices in the city area alone have risen by 18.5 percent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, price-worthy and student offers increased by about one fifth last year and were by £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property in London in recent months less attractive for foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "villen tax" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which stronger credit grant schemes were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in the sale of real estate and in the prices.
New data from the England Bank from Monday show a decline in the mortgage authorisation in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, on the basis of an already weakening home price consciousness.
The volume of transactions in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has declined by a quarter for year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts payable for date sales amount to more than £2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result the sales of the date have remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the highest level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased by 40 percent per year to £280 million, sales by 18 percent to £ 1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley for the current year would probably correspond to current market expectations.
Analysts estimate the annual tax result at £450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at £ 23.96 in London in the afternoon.
Nacktfotos by Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performance at the 85th Oscar award.
Nacktfotos of Oscar prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of other 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker for "explained injuries of privacy".
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were reportedly purchased by Apple's online storage system by a hole. The supposed "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have taken in the private environment of our home years ago - I hope you are so really satisfied with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" argues, however, that the photos of her are about pictures and seconded "These so-called naked images of me are FEILED, people.
Let's turn off the beginnings. * Word game intentionally*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop star Ariana Grande departed from her the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J".
She was whipped, so one could best describe it, they slowly resolved like a cardboard that you left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant, and maybe somewhat crazy.
And then shake his hand.
He knew scratching.
He was stubborn, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this tremendousness was a just beginning affair that had been promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life as otherwise, and perhaps even had brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremendous delicate beauty with untamed hairs and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion, who thought cheers for her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a wet but paradisiatic valley with the appropriate name Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaked, in the bathrooms were neither spiders nor naked necks had left their traces on all windows and believed that all belonged to them, and the garden was overwhelmed with uncrowded, which looked like huge coal pots.
It was like the house from a children's fair, both threatening and attracting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn on the broken loungers in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both of them had absent from the service console, which provided the country with calming music and sensing news when the sight of their crushed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long - forgotten black entertainer, whom his father liked to listen at closed roll shops in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their prestigious aggressivity, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so right forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully overwhelmed, just as the word overwhelmed.
The general taste created what the legacy and regulations never did, and how the people chose the ballads in books, from cellar to millionary fairs, cook books and loveromans, so they chose the ballads in the music.
In the Euphory of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a grove-comic serenade of Ailinn's large feet.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still young.
His father had played it with his own father, so he told.
When you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game at the time, and it wasn't very funny at this time.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what was jazz.
Ailinn had never heard what.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not banned directly.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only room for one "if" in life.
People wanted to be very sure at the beginning of a melody where they would end.
Like the mind.
His inevitability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed in mind.
Although he had become 10 years old without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew about jazz about his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailinn that Fat's Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singer wasn't black.
Again, there were no laws or conspiracies.
A consistent society meant that each element of this society agreed gratefully to the principle of grouping - thankful as those spared from destiny.
People with afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and body construction for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed as from nature with electronic talent and were responsible for ensuring that no family remained without working service telephone.
What was left of the Polish community was caring for the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks was broken down.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WHAT WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WAS WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WAS WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN HAVE HAVE BOAT TO BOOK TO BOOK, even fearing that the flames would consume them as the next would - had opened Lab and Shisha Piping Restaurants, thought themselves and became depressive with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn was difficult to understand how the insulting words that cheers had just sung her could ever be shown.
Music was expression of love.
"They are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too large.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceitful feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound damping of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he would hesitate to put two fingers back on the lips in her presence.
She thought he was something strange.
"It appeared funny to him," he said instead.
She shook unfaithfully her head and blocked Kevern's view.
There was nothing else to see all over the world than her uncommon raven black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're proposing it to me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't right away.
Maybe your necks, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my licks are too thick?
You hate yourself?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick necks are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be weird, he often brought himself into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm that one needed to occupy the cruelty in whistle.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kiev.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose up out of her chair, threw the console and shed the wine they had drunk.
Holunder flowers wine, so drunkenness wasn't an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to be mourning, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I feel perverted to you," she said...
Except that I'm not at all.
She was sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary unfriendlyness of his words and the fear she showed in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She hadn't told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as it was here.
The same huge and ice-cale ocean broke here as on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more treacherous after DEM WAS SCHEHEN WAR when they were their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, pulled from kneipe to kneipe, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or laughed.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she wasn't watching!
They first knit - Knutschen was the most used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a countergiving to the non-pronounced love balloon from the console - they first knock and then beat.
According to Kevern, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the knuts themselves already represented an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He raised himself out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt bleaching, but the grief of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew themselves.
She looked at him as he removed - as from a room on the top floor her companion looked at him at it - a man, complaining by something he had sworn up himself.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, shamed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well if she couldn't remember one time she had seen such a thing before this day?
When she was again alone, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
Several years ago, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked at a brief lecture on the continued violence at low and medium level in exactly the countries where their reduction, if not abolishing, is expected most, in view of the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has already been done a lot, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to deprive the innate aggressivity of a people who have led thousands of wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically seen despite the highly polluting turbulences between the hens rarely felt.
But some properties seem to be inevitable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion he continues to awaken.
The population wept when listening sentimental ballads, inflicted in stories about overwhelmed difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the former rawness keeps the rural communities as well as our urban structures in the hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and relieved strife at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"You have an unhappy tendency to exaggeration," her mentor said when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nuss tree lowered her head.
I have to ask, are you atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme appealed to her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feministin?
Still silence.
"I don't ask this," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a prejudication-free workplace.
We serve a non-prejudicious society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable in itself, can sometimes distort results as you have imagined.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "retainable" and "roh" could be interpreted by others as well as expression of a natural force and vitality.
If one continues to ride around, WHAT THERE IS WHEN IT IS WHEN, as if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the country its essential life force.
Esme Nuss tree looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED letter in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to their neighbors, appreciate their partner, hear ballads, visit Musicals, use her phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want," Esme Nussbaum answered with a quiet voice when she was sure that her superior had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we have not been as effective as we do ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves again, as we repeat the mistakes that have only led to DEM WHEN THE SHEED IST.
This time, however, it is not the others we are leaving our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To emphasize an English dog.
"They go too far," he said, "if you call actions as "defects" that our grandparents may have committed or not.
They also go too far when you speak of having left out their "wrath" and her "mistrauen" to "others".
Actually, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past, like protecting the present, we are not talking about "our" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of injustice, that's all we know.
"From the one who, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared inject, "no part of society can claim to have done well.
I don't complain to anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened has happened.
That was at that time.
There is nothing to say about that - we agree.
And just as no debt has to be allocated, no debt has to be repayed if such a deduction would be appropriate and if there was a way of cutting it.
But to what does the past serve if we do not learn from it-
The past serves to forget them.
If I can say something about that,
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramids collapsed.
"I'll remember her report," he said and left her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorbike driver who, as passengers described, had travelled on the footway in a kind of "brutal anger".
There's a chance.
Lesotho military member says that no state strike was planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho refused to have planned a state strike for the destruction of the government and said that they were committed to policemen who were accused of the arming of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and informed that the army of the country surrounded its office and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after he had reported an attack threat.
Military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is de facto no state strike, but the military reacts to the threat of "political fanatics" whose army was ahead by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces acted after having received several secret service reports that within the police are acting some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were shortly opposed to devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military action has made the impression of a conturn.
"Although no one has claimed that the government had been breached by violence, all reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho have so far shown signs of a state strike," he said.
On Sunday, speakers of Lesotho's military told us that the soldiers were slowing back into their barracks and that the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the administration during Thabanes' absence.
Thabane told him that he believed that he had become the target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There have been great tensions in Lesotho since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the disputes in his unity government.
He said that his actions wouldn't have undermined the government, otherwise loud accusations in spite of it.
Production in the euro area on a 13-month thief
The increase in production in the euro area in August slowed down to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a precisely observed study.
The final market manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An information above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined, and factories experienced breakdowns in a time of rising tension between the EU and Russia across Ukraine.
The figures shall be recorded before the European Central Bank meeting (ECB) on Thursday.
The market expects the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery of the euro area as well as for the threatening deflation at a inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further information during this week about whether it considers a quantitative relief for the euro area, in accordance with those carried out by the United Kingdom and the USA during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer to manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner in Russia in the EU, fell at the lowest in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains an worried child, as well as the decline in Italy from a solid expansion to the stetagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism of Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer soothing," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in the industry is probably the fire of the analysts that expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economic Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the shopping manager index of the producing industry in the Eurozone in August is that afterwards the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producents in the euro area are currently finding life quite difficult because the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably leads to some contracts being delayed or even canceled, especially large contracts.
He said that it would be more likely that the ECB should finally introduce a type of QE, although we suspect that this will be limited.
The hell decades of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the frightening occupation of the school, as the children who are entangled in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken as hostages from Czech militia in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom.
Just a decade after the devastating siege of the school of Beslan, where 334 people perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed to be the badest of evil.
The tragedy united west and east in abomination, then surprisingly transformed into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that has now endured Ukraine - and in the children like them dying - now finds an end.
The girl who was photographed during the trial to climb back to the shot school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she was only trying to climb back to the broken school sports hall after a mine was exploded.
Aida was completely confused and searched for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at that time.
My legs were bloody.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a number of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday said: "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I have to be surgery again.
Some granates are still in my knee.
Your goal is now to become a dentist to help the people as you were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she said foolishly.
"This has happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, although the memory becomes slightly weaker each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo from me online, how I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe, and help to prevent such a thing from happening again.
The boy who fled through the bullet hail in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russes go to school at seven years old) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me that I should lie down when there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Go."
Full of fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying little child on the way, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a bullet hail.
His father Wladimir, who closed his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality Tamara was stabbed outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, on their part in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I was crying for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir was later flew to London (from the now dissolved News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from the former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror persecuted you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's gonna be blown in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids with whom I played in the courtyard and who didn't do it outside.
We never say they were killed or were dead.
We say they've stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially at the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a car open upstairs.
But now he is afraid of location like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamity that he and his friends suffered.
This horror persecuted you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those suffering from the horrors," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I'd like to help you so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me next year at the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the horrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She alive remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London wept when I told our story.
At that time I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how it helped me and Damir.
I remember that Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and call them all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with cellans in a restaurant. Damir shot on her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and still killed.
These are just like our children.
I think for many of the war is a part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he's not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the sports hall and flamme candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered underneath - I remember that he sometimes sat on the sofa, turned the face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued to throw all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I, well-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for several hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came on my legs, I looked around, and the hell looked around me, with lying parts everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I called him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was so sure that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And that's how life goes on for us, unlike that of many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrible image after the siege became the symbol of Beslan's horror
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood - flooded face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life, while Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbari of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, had left him for his first day of school before she rushed to bring her older son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about and talk about it.
There is no single day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's long ago, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days follow me forever.
No one will ever forget this, I promise you.
Insisting: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was persecuted as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij was so happy to go to school this day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden from us at home in the book shelf.
I understand this, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes a bit horrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years have nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and feared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I'm always going to the sports hall when September 1 is getting closer.
I want to be my old childhood friend tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel as a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not gonna forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life continues.
I completed school this year and visit a medical university in Wladikawkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was trapped at the feet of a murderer’s terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel it was as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but because of his health damage due to the siege, he could not do so.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and felt something better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - in the year afterwards - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and ask me not to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of itself in the hospital after the shelter on the laptop
My pain is horrible and I carry him with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my hurt knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's secret service Academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, also the medical people, and they answered that it wasn't possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew that I would never report my experience to my children.
Children should not know anything about this, and of course they should not experience it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets closer.
I'll go to the celebrations for memorial.
I know Georgij won't go.
It's got to be much stronger for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn from it.
It's staying in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair is happening.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knees.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but he can't run a sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror at 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed at the siege and that only strengthens my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and I was expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is crying for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It is hard to accept that life continues even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What do these people fight for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe that.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we're fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still killed.
If only we could take and throw all these rebels out - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was carried in safety so vigorously by a special commission
Redettet: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special use command (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty
The world held the breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was worn in the arms of a Russian policeman from Beslan's siege.
The terrorists let them go, but in her cruelness her 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar kept back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous battle.
Her father Ruslan has married again since then and has a little girl with his new wife, Swetlana, who called Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, says neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that raise up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both are for about $300.
I have taken these photos at a family festival with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $ 350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other boxes are closed close.
Also set your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorder have scene and recording modes to optimize the exposure time for the immense underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Find in our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not fold.
Point-and-shoot cameras have a LCD that allows you to compose images, Action-Cams usually not.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to watch this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you're doing a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a series mode with which a series of shots are made with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface if you make photographs in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is especially important when you work with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame of the image.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As a consultant anaesthesia doctor, he devoted his career to the task of saving both the agonie of the disease and the pains of treatment to the sick.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 worker who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important to diagnosis and diseases, while those treated are mainly busy with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble raising myself.
While fighting with the grippe-like symptoms, he noticed that he made impatient accusations of his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather want everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and without reason worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct a X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray investigation was available.
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an unhealthy cancer that attacks the breast skin, which attacks the lungs overlapping skin.
As with most cancer diseases, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers have suffered from lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smoking in the past.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which once was considered "wonder fabric" but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, Mesothelioma is a disease that can ignore as easily.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has been no longer used in Britain since the 1960s when industry voluntarily committed to no longer using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - clemmer, construction workers, roommen and yard workers.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems hard to worry today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems, today experiences the climax of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Yearly figures of mesotheliomades since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we now experience the fatal effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 all asbestos types have been banned), is that a mesothelioma is only developing after decades.
And the pest of the Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbest was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
Mesotheliom therefore does not know class barriers, financial limits, occupations or ages.
The privileged basements, from the elegant shops in London to private schools, are not a protective room.
Parliament's buildings are asbestos infected.
Even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to be healed, this deadly carcinogen has already been made as a source of this carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a sticker either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and patriarchs - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my old people will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"From the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been sick of Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last one who still lives."
How many of us will still be sick?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
That was an unusual long survival.
Fifty percent of all Mesothelio brands die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us will still be sick?"
The leading expert in the UK on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if asbestos epidemic is expected to come to exist, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be victimized.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like that.

A brief look at the documents of the courts to which the persons concerned are often addressed for damage claims shows how far the pest of the mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer admitted, for example, that Janice Allen had abandoned asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was flagship stores in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she started her activity at M&S.
Now she has two children in the 20s.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would ever affect me.
There are only few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term Asbest refers not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as a white asbestos, is today the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe risolations, boile risolations, even for brakes in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos but is still considered by the EU and the WHO as a "large health risk" with possible death consequences.
But more dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolit).
Great Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it gives clear but indirect indications that this was a main reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomrates."
A staff of Marks & Spencer was exposed at the Flagshipstore at Oxford Street, London, Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliom victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that their history is not unusual.
He has presented a study of the affected persons, which shows that "a substantial proportion of the mesotheliomas without known suspension by work or in the home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one could expect to be sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed unawarely to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service powers and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be thrown up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Working Service stated that the Westminster Palace had received a "clear health certificate", it is now indisputable that £ 1 billion must be spent over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that, after the general elections in 2015, the Members will probably meet more in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the existence of asbestos was not handled according to the respective provisions."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do is wait.
A person who could never determine exactly how to contact asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital where asbestos complaint was decided positively," he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've worked on and the data.
What he remembered is the day at the beginning of December 2009, on which he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was just running a surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had shake frost.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pains of the chest coat touched the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprising doctors made X-ray shots of his chest and either put Pleurakat on to extract liquid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient came with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was older for several decades and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition was deteriorated and his household doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a serpent equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest coat.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
Honestly, I hadn't been so worried at all.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year in the week: "It was told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos isolation in hospitals were below the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who changed from one building in pedestrian tunnels to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or at underground cantines (such as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely to contact the toxic substances.
It appears that over several decades after the war hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their bunsenbrenners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its fabulous isolating and flaming properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have placed their bulsenbrenners on asbestos mats.
On websites, asbestos is now often addressed in schools.
And so there are innocent objects in our houses, such as floor plates or shoe roofs, which are standard asbestos.
"It is an industrial gift that is included in large parts of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his process against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a woman concerned was the breakdown of a garden puppet in the 1970s.
So be careful how to cut off your garden puppies.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealthy is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas festival.
With the greatest difficulty, the change in perspective was from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
How countless patients before him reminds him of how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very hard to take up all of this," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience any other Christmas festival.
That's it."
Mesotheliom is particularly haunting because it is our lifekeeping mechanism - breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is collapsed and the fibers are inhaled, they can be found in the chest coat, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled nadel-shaped fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax physician who changed to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital, from which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed it to the asbestos, is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their hospital training.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they will be pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancer diseases do not work so well in mesothelioma.
The efficacy of an operation, for example, is hotly controversial.
Some think she's worth an attempt.
Treasure neglects that.
"You can't cut out the chest coat," he says.
They don't get around with the knife.
Thus, the cancer "does not talk very well about chemotherapy," which shows "effect," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and advice office for fellow persons four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer centre," he was happy to present himself when calling.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "let things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not to be relocated, I just called and got an appointment," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesotheliom-infected people to be able to observe the best available therapies.
But if these treatments are inevitably failing, many people affected are of another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the judgments in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that one realized that a very low health risk was also a risk of health.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally contributed to their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation" since Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact on Guy's.
After his death investigation, however, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is a huge problem for Mesotheliom-infected people who are striving to compensate to ascertain the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the accusers.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesothelioma-related persons to charge compensation even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a £350 million fund fund supported by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact, but nobody can claim.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 percent of what a court could have said in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
Appropriately 300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom affected that 350 million pounds were a "very good work" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and he suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not gone away and Mesotheliom-adulter could find the companies and normally complain them.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in view of seven death victims, a quick action is necessary daily.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom law in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first discussions Lang-Lazdunski recommended a surgery that he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy with which long-laydunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent for five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course with the most important," says Abbott.
You can see that again and again in patients.
There's something that lets you go on.
If you give up, you're getting worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott signed the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's a lifetime.
Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the Tumore is visible anymore.
But the process is physically and psychically very hard.
You have to think of practical things - about the money if I am no longer, for example, or my wife shows how the Boiler time setting works.
If you get bad messages, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents, that's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I wouldn't be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very social and unstume.
She told her friends, and soon we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reluctant.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesothelio notes such conversations have not passed through hope, not from a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as finally also for Stephen Jay Gould) brings an angry security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong's right to government election, demonstrators swore retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action probably fires the long announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led the planning and mobilisation to this within a few hours after the clarification.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-preferential candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said Legal expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong were lying.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-general Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom returned control over Hong Kong to Chinese, Beijing promised that the inhabitants should choose the government presidency from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision from Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct election right to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership maintains the process through a closely controlled nomination committee held by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates should be allowed "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicly effective protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to scoot off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine general right to vote.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central adherents had gathered in the rain in front of the headquarters of the government in Hong Kong within a few hours after the proclamation.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement reached a new level of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make further information about this, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organisers informed that the movement "has considered the occupation of the Central District only as the last means, an action that should take place only if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the Announcement of Beijings for days, and there were reinforced security measures, including police forces and barricades, on Sunday before the government building.
The turmoil is strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.
The accession of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Moreover, fear grows that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to break down under the growing pressure of Beijings.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement, as it threatened the business operation - the Hong Kong lifestyle.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said Legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to make any fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media have also recently reported on the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western forces.
This summer, activists organized an inofficial referendum on the rights of elections in which 780,000 people participated - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of the school closure balls in the USA will now be transferred to the universities where Freshmen shows with the private aircraft.
We are delighted to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxurious travel service in Britain for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to kick their possessions in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to ensuring this year that the students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One company speaker said that no new bookings were made since the service had just been introduced, but added that "Students would book the service in the next weeks".
The company also informed that despite the study fees of £9,000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today differ very much from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that exactly.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as aborted.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month are exposed to a crisis of lifekeeping costs, as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep stepping up with the strongly rising invoices for the simplest life bases before they can even remember spending thousands of pounds for such simple as the arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants threw their hands into the air and sang, "Hans up, not shooting," while waiting before the funeral.
After two-week protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white females.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the gender in front of the race when it comes to addressing reproduction law and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers from white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared with the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9th, the personal essays with titles such as "Attention to Ferguson of a white woman" and "Feminism are not only about the oppression of women" were relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism one finds many people who are about white and speak privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt forced to express something to the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that they must express this.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University Ferguson revealed problems that black Americans are exposed every day, but are not considered to be "women" in the cultural area.
"I can publish something fun on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colory in their own country is under siege, the silence is ohrenbethinking.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the themes race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
" Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were polished and the reasoning was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point at which white fighters for women's election law such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for the right of election could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to act for women's election law, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When you remember such things, you become aware of power, why colored women do not trust white women.
We haven't done our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right of election in 1920, it took a decade until white women organized themselves against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group developed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminist women played "fangs" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Will it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to a child's education take as seriously as they do with the right to control imprisonment?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who built their careers in the fight for reproduction rights and access to preventive resources now try to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after Michael Brown shot on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, Columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger in the body - and opinions on the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will make changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism, in which racial and gender events are addressed, some of their comments on racial theme in America are still astonished.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young-coloured men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and hispanese men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police has attacked almost 63,000 unguided minors at the southwestern border of the country this year, the theme of immigration reform also comes back to the surface - this time as a theme of women.
Andrea Mercado, co-president of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for the immigration reform, said that for a re-examine of the topic as an essential theme of women, it should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large number of labour visas goes to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a posthall in the women's organizations," she said.
"Swine House" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house standing for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig that it had made it comfortable in the living room.
The freed house has a bedroom, is located on a private road in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - a pig also included that his head had embedded on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo, however, was misrepresented and was now removed," said a spokesman of the company.
In the Exposé of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique one-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The house sales provided interest in the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city Harvey houses a new millionaire after Lotto win
A lottery player from Harvey is running this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth takes on, with a happy winner who receives almost $1,1 million from the lottery attraction on Saturday.
A newspaper skiosk in Harvey for the second time in five years moved the jackpot in the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
The happy winner, however, still needs to report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit provides for conversational material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated profits in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had achieved the mega profit of $7.5 million only a few weeks earlier.
The winner couple had played for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with almost 85 million dollars.
Leonidas battered in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only were the gladiators at the first Rhinebacher Roman day in the recreational park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who invaded the rainsaws and the herbish cold and left themselves uninterested by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful series of representations, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting troops from the Gladiatorenschule "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust battle art in the soft sand-prepared arena.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men into the ring to the heroic twin battle in various gladiator holes.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg shoes on the left leg and armchair on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with breast plate, short-sized and worm lantern as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", which came on the ground with thrownet, drummer bag and dolch against the "Secutor" after a short struggle.
Since the swords metallically joined each other, the shields shattered and the waist lances flew surfing through the arena that anxiety and bange could become for the health of the gladiators.
However, the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular arbitrator, had an eye always attentive.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of Roman times experience," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friendskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation from the recreational park for one day a "oppidum Romanum" became a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage found in his greeting word.
Finally, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest into our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
The rest of it was also to be surprised at the Roman day, e.g. "Aquäduct-Marmor" of the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman channel bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus society once confronted the water and energy supply, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time."
This also confirms diploma measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, which presented measurement instruments of Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations anno 1894, as well as bricks from the original hypocauste, the warm air heating, which once warmed the Roman villa.
Incredibly also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the footsteps of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landdenkmalpflege Office had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park North in Rheinbach.
You have found conversion walls of an economic building with a darre to dry cereals and meal.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass violet, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, suspected Morscheiser.
The children also used the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s milling game, or they once wrote the Roman students their names with metal handles on wax boards.
At the stand of the Roman thermals Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, to bastle glass mosaics at the stand of the Museum of Glass Rheinbach, and to use a heavy wheat mill from stone at the stand of the centre of Eifel Nettersheim to grind the flavor for a flavoring bread or a müsli.
With the originally rebuilt Roman cars drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors passed through the leisure park and also passed by the impressive state of the urban gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Römer project week" here.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter into the 2014 Roman year of Rhineland, which is intended to remind of the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations, as well as the Wachtberger Wanderverein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, a talk, cooking evenings, and tours for school classes are offered and are reminded of the Roman past Wachtbergs.
For example, a Roman legionary will tell about his work on the nearby Wachtberg, presented plants as living monuments from the Roman era, and offered a funny lesson in matters of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and attracted Romans.
In the course of a project week, Adendorf's primary school devotes itself to the Roman theme.
With the Roman week, the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made available again at first glance.
A small presentation will remember the found of the Berkumer Matrone sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic burdens West Africa’s economy
Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a heavy blow for the economy.
Markets are abandoned - and international companies are on a distance.
The devastating Ebola Epidemia causes the economy of West Africa a heavy blow.
The harvest is rotting on the fields that mines are left and the markets are missing - the virus has severely increased the region.
Some international companies are also already on a distance.
"Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic crisis," judges the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the worst affected
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, selling clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
The market only comes who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is most hit by the virus, and here alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities explained that the disease had occurred in every corner of the country.
The virus also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
Overall, more than 1500 people died, and thousands of others were on.
Foreign companies depart from employees
In all the resource-rich countries, companies are exercising their business.
Foreign companies, such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal, distract their employees, several international airlines no longer flying the regions concerned.
Indigenous dealers and farmers also respond: Only a few merchants leave their homes to get a copy of them.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the important cocoa and coffee beans for export have been rotted on the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Foods are getting short
"The people will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris Expert for Western Africa's economy.
For example, the man who normally goes to the market and sells its vegetables would prefer to stay home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
On the markets, the stocks of basic foods, such as rice, disappear.
At the same time, the strongly dependent region threatens image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies usually avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of French Think Tank Iris.
Be decisive, how far and how long the virus will spread.
For investors, the impression could arise, "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also burdens the poor state budgets of the Member States
The disease also burdens the State budgets of the countries concerned which have already been disrupted.
The Moody's rating agency fears that their budgets are severely affected by the high expenditure on the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (€45 million).
In Nigeria, the effects are already irritable, where only few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of an infection.
Bookings in hotels also go significantly back.

==References====External links==
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker have taken over the rule.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" came from 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "Social Entertainment by Exercise in the Room Suits and Small Caliber Shooting".
In 1937, the NS regime had caused the resolution of the association.
Only 19 young men found themselves again in 1964, who raised the "new" "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism on April 30 at the guest house of Luke.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter through a difficult starting time, in which it was mainly about finding a club location and installing the shooting business.
Already in autumn 1965, the Schützenverein started in the guesthouse "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sportsmen, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes to 1. Gauliga.
The club records purpled annually and the magic border of 380 rings was first reached by Rudi Meier in 1980.
As the performance of active protectors has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the association site "Leininger" no longer satisfies the demands of a modern shooting club, the then board under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future Domizil in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours on 8 May 1988, priest Strasser gave the church blessings for the new shelters.
One of the major highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gaussing, associated with the celebrity wading of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated his 30-year-old founding anniversary.
A Böller Group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl was Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böllertreffen 2005.
In many hours of honorary work, the club members have modernized the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngau Hof last year and thus brought them to the latest state of technology.
Elf teams in round competitions
You can also see the sports performances of the Schützenverein.
A total of eleven teams are currently engaged in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, a air gun-manship, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann was rising in the 2013/14 round of the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB).
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml rose from Gauliga north to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sports, events such as Bocksticks, Faschings and Königsball, club trips and Christmas celebration have tradition.
With this, the guards are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers accidents when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart ran against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre was placed in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said that his 14-headed team was disappointed, but now focus on the race on the next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we hope we can make it better there.
Stewart was already running at the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I came into a good result with quite good hopes today," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the Schlepper and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met and killed another driver at a ash train race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and to win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., which took place during a race to face Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities informed that the investigations for the cause of the accident would last at least two weeks.
No decision has been taken about whether Stewart has to expect an accusation.
The three-time champion was received with a great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start on 12th position, Stewart had already entered the first 10 and was temporarily on place four.
After a reboot in round 122, bushes
Cars with no. 18 out of control after exit from curve 2 and collided with stewart, both cars were driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to place 21.

Ukrainian army has given up Luhansk Airport
In East ukraine, the prorussian fighters are further on the march.
After heavy battles, which were supposedly also involved in Russian pancerbataillon, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, gave up the airport of the Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army informed that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeat of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army, without mentioning details.
Prorussian Separatists shot plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government teams, prorussian separatists once again shot a fighter and two military helicopters.
Some 100 soldiers had also been injured or killed in battles in the Donezk region, the Rebellians informed Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard Boats Resented
The rebells also claimed that two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time had been reduced in the Asovian Sea.
The Ukrainian border protection confirmed that two of its ships were shot on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards had been injured, said a speaker in Kiev to the broadcaster 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The Separatists also reported that several localities in the Donezk area had been controlled.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk today the Ukraine contact group meets.

NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia through the planned stationings in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that the NATO is following the 1997 NATO-Russia Council's founding agreement.
The NATO Chief, however, accused Russia of "an awkward break" of the agreement.
"Today, we have to look into the reality that Russia does not view NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
From documents and statements from Russian side, "that they view us as opponents".
Strengthening NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that they want to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be concluded at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new discussions on the settlement of their gas dispute.
The negotiations were set for the next Saturday, said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for a European Union decision to send a representative to the discussions.
Because of the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine no longer receives fuel from Russia for weeks.
Lastly, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had provided both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe refers about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: Toll will come "all clear"
Now, the Chancellor again clearly acknowledges it.
A free letter for all complicated details, but it's not.
Hard-necked concerns from the CDU against the car wall have increasingly enraged the CSU.
Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel has spoken of a word of power for the introduction of a car wall after persisting resistance from her CDU.
"To make it clear, it stands in the Coalition Treaty, and it will come," said the party's chief on Monday after meetings of the CDU headquarters in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not first determine a detailed model.
In the black-red government programme, certain parameters were called.
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and it is now being further worked on."
The NRW CDU, however, persists on its no toll on all streets.
Merkel stressed that financial minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also contributes constructively to the discussions for a draft law.
In addition, he talked with Dobrindt about further ways to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special." Schäuble had left an "level" report uncommentated on Sunday, his house examines his own concept to compensate for motorway investors with toll revenue - after election 2017.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer then warned of developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never assumed to excite all circles and federal roads," said the Nordrhein-Westphalian CDU country president.
In that way, it is an important signal that Seehofer has announced to talk again about the topic.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverbände Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
The background is the fear that a toll affects small border transport to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition crews because of the toll criticism of the CDU.
The Left considers the plans in view of the dispute in the Union as failed.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said party chief Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Montag).
"With the toll, the Minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German streets to start in 2016.
According to the Coalition Treaty, domestic owners may not be charged additionally.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, the model may not disadvantage foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnostic
A British says she thought as a result of a misdiagnose for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the backmark.
Charity CMT UK informed that failure diagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in Great Britain are likely suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weaknesses, an insecure pathway and curvated toes.
Disease also suffers from fatigue or pain. The disease is unhealthy and progressive, which means that the symptoms are getting worse in time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children today, 51 years old, said, "As a child, I knew that I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell constantly and everything took longer with me.
I could never ride with the other kids Rollshoes or Skateboard and was often in school because of my way to run and walk.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 years after several operations to discharge her acillary beans and stretching her feet, she saw her sickness acts when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got an answer, I was shocked and paniced.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and slowly all my abilities would lose.
I made this all alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said, when she became 17, she became aware that her abilities had not taken as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and embraced me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, or you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life threatening.
After some genetic tests, it was found in its CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Awareness month to make aware of this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former troop exercise site
For almost ten years, there has been no shooting at the former troop exercise site in Munich.
Nevertheless, killing ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the biosphere region of Schwäbische Alb.
The granates are sometimes so dangerous that they must be sprinkled on site.
An ohren-beating knall halls with the explosions over the heartpiece of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell at the Münsingen Army Exercise Station, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares large area has been the core of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb, which is open on 13 routes for hikers and cyclists.
Taxation of businessmen in Washington is increasing with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for companies in the country have risen slightly last year, while economic recovery has accelerated, a newly published study last week, and the companies in Washington were no exception.
Companies in the area District, Maryland and Virginia together paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase by 3.8 percent compared to the revenues of 2012 amounted to $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of decreasing decisions 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased stronger than local taxes, 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by Ernst & Young Service Agency with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from company taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenues come from companies.
Virginia earns the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is founded in a recovery of the real estate values of the companies, the researchers say what led to an increase of real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the expiry seems to be true of Washington's area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia together paid over $10 billion to government and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase by 4.2 percent over a year.
But the apparent recovery of real estate values is not so effective in Maryland in increasing government and local tax revenue, as the real estate taxes are about more than one fifth of the tax decisions of companies here.
Businesses in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland the following happens: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to offer the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenue by companies cannot be attributed only to the recovery of the real estate market
It also seems that business revenues are recovered, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes for government organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in company income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, local taxation for companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The growth rate in the district corresponded to 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was considerably higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a lower average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has, with 6 percent in all three offices, the significantly lowest company income taxes (in all three firm tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study of the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that Virginia demands lower government and local corporate taxes and a globally better tax climate than in Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its company tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the next year, this law could reduce the State's income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in Washington seem to go better and therefore pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businesses - a transitional structure after which most small companies are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than the overall company taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in company taxes throughout the country will probably continue this year, with an increase in general multi-fire tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could go behind if the Federal Government’s expenditure reduction affects the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German beer for Guangzhou
Hopes and Malz - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wishes a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brown in Frankfurt’s partner town Guangzhou - this is the urgency of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would stay in our city," said the Vice Party Secretary of the South Chinese Metropole, Li Yiwei, this week visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
During the discussion, the official of the governing Communist Party of China returned again and again to this concern of the Twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, was Li.
Therefore, people also possess the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gumbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, cereals and enjoyment," he added at lunch with the party supervisor in Guangzhou.
This enjoyment of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the functionary from Guangzhou arrived with baker-gombel - but with red wine served for the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewery art.
Tsingtao-Bier is used after the German purity command.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Parteichef Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier but in 2012 for economic reasons deleted.
"It would pay again," the municipal politician was convinced.
"Business between our two cities continues to increase."
At present, travellers would have to take the route over Changsha in Hunan Province, complained Li.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight.
The Vice Governor of the Province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," said Schäfer-Gumbel - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nicked.
Supported Partnership
Guangzhou's pleasurable vice-chief hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already at Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to office this year only after his predecessor had been carried out from the office for claims of corruption.
The local party chief Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the functionaries from Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is carried out with hardness by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
He worked as a top official in Fujian, where the VW car builds a large work before his arrival in Guangzhou.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers away Guangzhou belongs to those who are maintained by both sides, e.g. with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year-old existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis on the pearl flow is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic power.
The next year, she wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, reported Li.
The family of Joan Rivers "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been conscious of three days ago since she was delivered to a hospital in New York City; however, her daughter today was hopeful that the 81-year-old comician recovered from her illness.
"Thank you for your persistent love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We're all pressing the thumbs.
Her mother was sent to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency of heart rest in a clinic at Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors intentionally keep them sedated and under precise observation until they are more satisfied with their state, which is still described as "earst".
The reactions came from many pages, also in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaner and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that come into trade from today, stricter environmental standards will apply.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners receive from 1 September to a label where the buyer can detect central data at a glance like the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, more nitrogen oxide values are applied in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the armor builders: they receive a united minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys twitch for $1,04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twich for $1,04 billion (970 million US-$).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one had expected a takeover of twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twich to Google's video service for a cool billion decided thing, and the cooperation also appeared naturally.
Twich, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", so an insider.
The Twich interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better exchangers give the (mostly older) games a suit of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just like that YouTube is often called when you want to describe twitch, so the message that YouTube twitch wanted to buy was taken up a bit, a bookbook example of a established technology company that buys a potential competitors.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not achieved, as the company reported was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twich.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to drive sports than watch them, it is difficult to understand the attraction that is about watching others when playing instead of taking into hand the control console.
It's one thing to look at a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning, as she slept by Resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a spider as he's shot in Call of Duty 20 times after each other.
All these games can be seen right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so viewing without control of the view perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast cycles in which the Roger Bannisters have completed all the games of our electronics age in record time are entertaining.
But as long as not a game or humor virtuose is involved, his twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know like I already know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It's hard to imagine that twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video, as YouTube Twich could have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are being converted as advertisements.
As the president of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of Gaming," and the medium shows no signs of a shrinking, not even - swallow - as a spectacular sport.
At the Hüpfburg at the Burggarten festival, there was a lot on the evening.
The concept of organizers was correct.
Despite the strong rainboat on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
The entry had to be stopped in time.
"That was angry," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness in the day and the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was shown early in the evening when the first visitors came to open air.
A festival for all generations had promised the organizers.
And they did.
Around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese it had made salt wedelers, but also guests from the nearest and further surroundings comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, wipped with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cool beverages - short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were said.
And that cross through the generations.
While one on ceilings on the extra-carced white sand leaped at the beach bar, others were able to reach a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the offspring in the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the child’s swallowing, the voluntary helpers in the truest sense of the word had to do all the hands to become the Andrang Lord and to enchant fantasy creations in the small faces.
The largers used the crickets or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew founded from saltwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 punched he down to the visitors, especially families searched for the wide and dry.
But the attraction of the festival did not terminate this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of "a success on the whole line."
That's why a replay of the big party will not be opposed in the next year.
Although it is still necessary to work on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear in a first balance on Sunday against the people's voice.
As angry, he described that the intake had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little forces.
The result: Some who had already paid were no longer on the site.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organisator spoke of about 1200 visitors in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox broke off their appearance.
The technicians were unable to create half-way reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt wedded because of a tyre pan.
"But next year they will be there," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was more than successful from the visitors.
And that's bad weather.
However, the organizers have committed some mistakes that will be for the first time, but must be eliminated at the second edition.
In the social network Facebook, the organisers must also take criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"You have taken a little," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I think it's very good that some not only dumb quats, but also really try to put something on their legs.
Take care!", Stephanie Jenß writes to Amula.
Now the organizers remain a year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's signs shrinking
This is not expected to be the case.
Rather, the willing component is waiting to be used in the marking building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the Space Observation Radar TIRA, the cover, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47,5 meters than the old.
But the size remains world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old cover is separated and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new cover is set up.
As far as the weather is involved, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participants at the Ice Bucket Challenge dominates pine
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain cried so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she wounded the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket chalenge went painful right there.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had shouted so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she drove out the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain circled so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that hurt her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaw remained just standing," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is shaken over the 20-year-olds.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't go, the jaw was crochet, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw that, and they almost made laughter into the pants, but I had to get in the emergency.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was sent to the hospital to re-enter the jaw after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The Clip was linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Can the castle clubs get back to a strain soon?
Last time, there was a conflict between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the boards think about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former president of Wolfratshauser Burgfriende, launched the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfriend Wolfratshausen.
The views of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed quite different so far.
Now the two camps are moving together: soon talks should be conducted about a common approach.
This confirms the federations Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could put together once," reports Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of the two associations could be able to move back to a strain in the future.
This is how faster visible success can be achieved.
While the Burgfriends around the suddenly died Richard Dimbath had a look at the rebuilding of the castle at the mountain forest until the last time, for the Burgverein around Sjöberg, the "experience and experience" of the site is at the foremost place.
Herbert Piffl, second Chairman of the Burgfriend, was very pleased according to his own information about the call.
Since Dimbeth's death, he has been in charge of the castle friends.
A new chairman will be found in a memberial meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently counts around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbat, we have let the association activities first rest out of respect." This "Denk phase" was needed to "consider how it could continue."
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go to the conversation with the castle club.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current mood image within their grouping.
There is currently no presidency candidate, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He does not want to claim because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The töler wants to continue to work on the project "but very much".
The different viewpoints on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honors Dimbeth as "Missionary" who always believed in the rebuilding of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
By a high participation of the population as well as by voluntary helpers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "Even I was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to drive the project forward." It could be created a "all-configuration feature" for the Flößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"The idea of reconstruction I personally don't want to just throw on board." He hopes that the Burgverein might move something on this point.
Their goal to document the story first is "is important and good".
After that, you could continue to see.
Clever ways to save at Uni-Learnbooks
Since the costs for university books for many students are more than $1,000 a year, the fast-two-semester student Matt Schroeder was considering a clever sparide.
He found a lending system for books of higher semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-keks," said Schroeder, 19 who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college director informed that the students spend more than $1,200 per year for teaching books and study material, but that there were different cost reduction options for the students.
Online loads and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution to the choice for the students.
Renting books become more popular, so students can use a book a semester for a long time, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookshops, told that the rental of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookshops were rented last spring semester, Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all tutorials are purchased in Campus Bookshops, according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one time for the best deal.
Buy Online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are in the campus book shop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be charged for $239.99 in the specialized book retailer Chegg.com.
Buy Used
If you do not make the notes of other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business".
The book was newly sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether earlier expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of costs for the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rental
Renting books is worth considering if you treat them somewhat well, remember giving them back and you do not want to keep the books after the course is completed.
You can save more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the provisions of the business where you rent, including the penalty charges that may apply for writing notes, underlinings or signs of use.
Tenants watched: If you don't return the book, the penalties can even exceed the price of a new book.
Emails
E-books instead of conventional teaching books are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg as well as Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students often find the best offers in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering teaching books can be very expensive.
Look around anyway.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination of books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order you should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually premature.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college book shop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" wasn't a cash striker
"The Expendables 3 from Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the USA, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only played $12 million of its budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" tailored to Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million at the opening week, while children's films like "Drachenzämen leicht gemachten 2" also disappointed the revenue.
An article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that in the children's films the lack of quality could be the reason for the movies themselves.
Collin described in 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "Drachenzähmen leicht gemacht 2" as purely "functional" fantasy progress.
In films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for every summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 to at least 2000 line walls in the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and suggest that this year's film heat is equivalent to that of the past year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's junglebook film, said to Hollywood Reporter's website: "I think the times change."
We need to accept this and not try to follow the past.
Contrary to the current weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently achieved sales with streaming income of $11.2 billion, almost twice as much as the previous year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they concentrated too much on comics filming and prophesied a "cern melt" Hollywoods.
In the light of the current deviation, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could well contain a real core.
However, due to the potential cash strikers to be expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as a simple "cyclic" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the largest summer on the cinemas at all, and no one will worry about the business."
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted for the penalty of the ligen division, this has been a step in the right direction.
The Deutsche Tischtennisbund has now taken an additional 3. Bundesliga into the program.
The result: Whoever hasn't risen is rising.
Thus, Göttingen's class highest team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the departure, but in the coming season only fiveth-class plays.
Fourth-class Torpedos Ladies, despite their grandiose passing into the Regional Liga.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxonyliga, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo reserves are in the new Association League, and there are no more Göttinger Clubs in the Landesliga.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Association League, the Torpedo second in the National Liga.
What looks like a better district class is now the new district Soberliga South.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Upper SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC arrive.
As regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the Upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III, the district soberliga of the women begins at least in Sollstärke.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are starting in the districtsliga.
With each nine teams
The SC Weend sends his girls to the small district liga.
The District Liga Foundation of the SCW-Jungen - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen circle lines start with nine teams.
In the West Staffel are Red White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengler II.
In the eastern staffle, among others, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
The Ladies-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in Osterode, where there are no women's teams at the circle level.
It is noteworthy that none of the six 2nd classes are at stake, here the innovative and circular board will have to think about once.
Nato Summit: First protest in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests from opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counterpart.
Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments on the weekend and spoke to demonstrators traveling from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWEE young bush wanders were secured with the sailing winds after they were caught the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govets Leap in Blackheath to their tour.
Cared relatives called the police at about 20 a.m. when they hadn't returned home.
A search team from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found near Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had hurt himself on the knees and the man was crashed and had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed at the couple overnight, and they were flew out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition with a ambulance.
Escalate Government Opposing Protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators had been pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The broadcaster resumed the radiation after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged devices in the editorial operation.
Dead or injured have not been reported.
The demonstrators call for the resignation of the head of government to which they submit election fraud.
The police informed that about a mile from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, it had come back to collisions of about 3000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital information, a policeman was injured.
During the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to penetrate to Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters, the mighty military had called for a political solution to the conflict to "don't waste and apply without violence".
It also said: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state."
The escalating violence has caused concern for a military intervention that has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have lasted since the day of independence on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We won't go back without having forced Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qadri said similarly.
Khan suggests Sharif to have won the parliamentary election last May by fraud.
Qadri demands the withdrawal of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government intends to reform the election system and to call out new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
At first, the demonstrators had persevered peacefully in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them to prevail at Sharif's residence during the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second season victory on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday ended a reconciliation.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," said Captain and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who pushed with green white on place three.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to the Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season victory and goes to the country game break with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said Foreign Defense Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership fully of the sixteen-degree in the 14th minute, won the victory.
"I thought I was gonna go in all the frustration from Thursday and snatched him under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had met on 13 November 2010 for the last time in a Bundesligaparty, it was still for Ried.
The first championship strike in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me this is a very special thing, I am from the rapid childhood," said Schrmmel.
Due to the short-term basin blessur of Mario Pavelic, scrambled from the left to the right defensive side and made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also carry out this position mirroring.
He deserved the gate, he has already done some Assistians," praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally made the decision.
Because before, the guests could also have been able to write.
"Thank God we have had a little luck today," said Schrummel, who played on the outbreak of performance and results in the past weeks: "The results have not voted, but the players have always been good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games you've been better than today" – against "the strongest team that played in this stadium in this season".
The first three-pointer since July 26 has therefore proved that the team's crew was intact, however,: "Today, my team has shown that she has character."
Not less pleased for him: "That we finally played too zero again".
A lot of work during the country game break The fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several outsources are to be complained, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start elevation, make the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," said Barisic, who lost with Behrendt and Pavelic players over the last three days, "they were very stable in recent times".
Therefore, the country game break has to be used to "lick wounds and to make a little in the physical area," Barisic, who has five U21 selection actors in his orders.
One of those who probably gets the break specially located is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, passes over pain.
Just in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his variation in the 68th minute not only the structure but also the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match from the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 about the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe it's all right now" "We've probably also had a little luck, but at any point luck has to come back to us.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He prompted to continue concentrated: "You must not always see this black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as it was presented.
But we must not believe that everything is all right now.
He could not contend with the significance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
In some stages, they keep on to me," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to suggest himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counterpart "from the category of magicians", as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly known by arbitrary colleague.
The only accusation I can make of the team is that we weren't concrete enough towards gate in some stages.
We have had too little conclusions.
Interior defendant Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It just started badly, but then we found pure and even made a gate.
Overall, it would have been more in it.

We showed a powerful tribe at our riddle task of the summer series "My piece of Rhine's Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still in the district, the figured specimen is the "sheep" above under-white brown.
A hollow footway leads up to the about 600-year-old oak.
It passes on groups, basalt stones and basalt stone lakes.
A piece below the stone break from the Bauerberg, one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it stretches beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and remembers an American mammoth tree with an area of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree steam indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intensive research, however, there were mere references to the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bishopsheim Archive and asked older people from underwhite brun to find out what kind of concern it has with the pigeon rest.
The result of his research remained the rather nutritious declaration for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat shirts should have driven their animals from under-white brown into the timber-roded meadows and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the exhausted animal guards of the ascension should have rested.
Meanwhile, the area has gained its importance back, because on the meadows actually wept goats again.
The area has also been explained to the core zone of the biosphere reserve, and Schneider has further discovered.
When you enter the stone collections, however, you should be cautious, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for crusades.
A hiking path leads from under-white brun to the tree, but something hidden.
Further paths are indicated, the direction of high-roon and invite to an extended hiking.
Where's the Waterburg?
However, a waterburg, which is searched for at our next task, is more rare at the height.
The mirroring in the grave already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district to which the building conterfia could fit.
Where is our "step of Rhine's happiness"?

After a week, Italy's Prime Minister and ambitious EU Chairman, Matteo Renzi, has carried out the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, against strong conservative resistance on the EU special summit last week, she becomes successor to the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government newspaper La Repubblica represents the calling of its Mogherini as a favorite as well as the strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects a drive for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the constant left-handed party base, because Mogherini is assigned to it, though rather, in a moderate manner.
On the contrary to the conservative representatives with the President of the Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and the President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, said the predominant opinion in Rome to make a political compensation.
Because the EU's head diploma becomes a representative of the Commission's President Juncker at the same time.
The outstanding agreement of the EU Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would have hardly called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the governing Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that Mogherini, who has proved to be the "standard challenges" for almost two decades in leading party offices and for their ambitiousness.
The born Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began the PhD Politologian in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democrats of Sinistra (Links Democrats), which joined the Margherita Catholic Center Party in 2008 to today's social-democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
With the 2001 election in the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she joined the High Party Policy, worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head became her soon.
It occupied traditional focuses on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO use in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troop quota, the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the US Democrats.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Members in which she has been a expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his Foreign Minister.
If the PD has a better relationship to the strong peace movement in the country today, which contributed to the more than 40 percent votes of the party in the EU elections in May, then, as is said in PD cruises, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The precautions in Brussels, the new EU external representative has too little diplomatic experience, so if it is lacking substance, the PD is listed.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, it is mystrously realistic accent Mogherini's being pursued for the crisis in Ukraine and is a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi entered his term of office as EU Chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first visit.
Photos that they showed with Putin in the Shake hand were embarrassed in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kreml Chief for October to be a Mailänder Economic Summit.
A total of nine young people began their training at Emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an Azubi which has already completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new employees will work in the future: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and procedure mechanics (two).
All Azubs come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel worry-free and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new educators previously attended primary or secondary schools and real schools.

The socialists in France should "keep the mouth and make France right," said the most important allies of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist presidents whose government reconstruction has been offended by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said at a great applause.
As an appalling gesture, the Prime Minister stated that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a cessation of the regime of Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show himself "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, struck sand into the gear, in which she appeared at a meeting of absent Socialist Members and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "belief in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the constant tomb fights of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old one hasn't even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive the autumn or winter," said Fräulein Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the reputation of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that she would come out as winners in preferred elections and be willing to go to the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat at the municipal elections in March and the judicial national front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of falling into several rival groups before the end of the term of office of Holland in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not aim to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel fast that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise provider, has advanced negotiations for the acquisition of Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises as well as to its wealthy customership, while there is competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the conversations could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company in Miami operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.

It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is totally $29 billion and in the next few years it is expected to be strengthened by the central class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice in the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises requested the stock exchange course with the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder of the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in his current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a recreational and casinomic group under the control of the Malay Milliardär Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.

Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China on the day following the election decision.
A peking-faith group swept near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must at first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with peking-faith members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposing democrats to be approved to choose and caused pro-democratic activists to perceive their threat and to lahm the Hong Kong financial area with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and the Chinese party leadership fears that the calls for democracy extend to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in June China's domination over Hong Kong, democracy activists held an inofficial referendum on the election procedure in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Lis survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese connection office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, as well as the Vice-Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted over the course of the day.
Student activists announced gathering in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the headquarters office.
United Kingdom has not provided democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin requires Kiev to take up "state talks" with Eastukraine
The Russian president Vladimir Putin, who said that on Sunday, Russian media reports demanded that the Ukrainian government launch the fight against the separatists in the eastern part of the country and directly negotiated with negotiations on the "state" of the abbreviated region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the Separatists under control would become part of Russia, but that his status toward Ukraine had to be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiewer government for negotiations at the height of the eyes with the pro-Russian rebellions, however, corresponds to the strategy that he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the excretions five months ago: help for the separatists in taking areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government in order to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossija factual independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with the State TV channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recover the areas held by Separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18th.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently called the area "Novorossija" or "Newrussland", a term that reminds of the prerevolutionary glossy of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on the 26th Oct. and during government groups of civil communities in the Separatists held areas, hope to be "fangen in their illusions", reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to open up detailed discussions not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the south-eastern Ukraine to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to state in context with the greater autonomy that has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to scatter fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kreml speaker for correcting the "Fehlin interpretation" of Putin highlighted the leadership claim of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct annex of the Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much greater difficulties to address the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in East Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict gave a broad majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kreml de facto control over an area that connects the Russian state area with the Crimea.
The Peninsula, annexed five months ago in the Black Sea, is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and castries that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislation - after re-elections - should consider an addition to the constitution to which the respective areas are given greater control of their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose armor and rebellion is accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at the height of the eyes was followed by a further invasion of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks have entered eastern Ukraine across the previously peaceful region along the Asovian sea.
The Separatists supported by Russia took over in the hands, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officers, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Nowoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been made to establish Mariupol, a steel industrial harbour with 500.000 inhabitants, located between Nowoasovsk and narrow access to the Crimea Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urged actions to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We're in front of a point where there's no return anymore," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not adopt concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank colonies and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donezk region last week to support the armed separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, enclosed by the Russian accident in Ilowajsk, were exchanged against 10 Russian parachute hunters who had been captured in Ukrainian territory on Sunday.
Nacktfotoscandal around Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey noblest made no heal for his anger over hackers who probably have stolen naked images of his engaged Gabi Grecko and a who is who stole the A promis from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking candal around Promis on the Internet.
The hacker has 60 nackt photos from Lawrence, star from "the tribute of Panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
From Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, it is said that private photos were also published due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 Promis on the list.
The noblest who had engaged with Grecko last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reported that a news website said that the hack was "hameful" and that the affected people felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she is without a pool.
The filmworks Palmers include "Love is unconquerable" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ: "It's an abomination of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "To post hacked images from a cell phone is nothing but the sale of Hehlerware."
Just legally seen, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radlers, Joggers and Wanderers were at the 8th Radeln on the Großen Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the association "Help for Cancer Children".
The tour, which was one torment, was a lightweight training for the others.
In one, however, all agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For for the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhauses has travelled yesterday with the wheel on the Feldberg.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cater, since he also made a valuable knowledge of the "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) association in favour of the Big Feldberg.
A great thing.
"I now know I can do this - fine!"
Little pillows on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would've been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants were tormented to mountains yesterday in the early tau and came near the exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier for others to overcome the nearly 11 kilometers long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The completely red green politician from the round day - red dress, red bike - made a little bit on understatement at the start ("Every lot of professionals, there is arrival the goal!"), but then proved to be half a professional at the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the route in a slide, as well as Nina Kuhn, press speaker of the city of Oberursel, who had gone along with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radles" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "This is about Charity, we like to do with it - we would have done a exit today," says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had descended to Oberursel in the morning to shample back to the height immediately.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swept home in the saddle at 9 o'clock, "made" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Fun had also "Fritten-Toni".
For the Chief of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, bike tours across the Feldberg are easy.
He had burst 40 minutes with his 6.5 kilo wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The through-trained Mainzer says that he is a "ambiguous racing bike".
He must be, too, because he was on his way with the "Fixie-Rad", which are also racing bikes, but without switching...
It was not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, but also a Jogger who went on a cord with weights.
Bergwacht-Artist Professor Volker Lischke, who was equipped with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, for safety, said, "That I know" from Frankfurt, who trained for a special sledge train, only that he pulls the sledge itself." So, the man is his own sledge dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - were sent to groups on the route in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 p.m.
It followed the first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers left.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the club "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished to the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to lock the route up to the Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
